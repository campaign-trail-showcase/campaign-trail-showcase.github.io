Your campaign against Governor Tim Walz was bold, unflinching, and rooted in conviction, and tonight the American people affirmed your message of renewal, hope, and principled leadership.\n\nFrom the earliest days when you declared your intention to serve, you spoke not only of ambition, but of duty. You pledged to restore trust, to bridge divisions, and to reposition America as a confident champion of freedom and opportunity. Throughout the campaign you demonstrated courage, meeting crowds in rural towns and city neighborhoods alike, listening more than talking, and always keeping your promise that government must serve the citizen, not the other way around.\n\nGovernor Walz mounted a strong, earnest challenge, representing a coalition of interests and a vision of a more managed, cautious trajectory for our nation. Yet the voters reached a clear verdict: they believed that your path, the path of bold vision, renewal of national purpose, and respect for individuals’ liberty, was the right direction for America in this moment.\n\nAs your current Vice President, and fellow Republican, I could not be more honored to have walked this road with you. The long nights, the unexpected obstacles, the moments of decision — all of them now culminating in this outcome. But the victory itself is only the beginning. What lies ahead demands more than energy. It demands character. It demands that you govern with the same integrity, clarity, and openness that you campaigned with.\n\nHere is what I pledge to you now, as you prepare to assume the highest office:\n\nYou must serve with full loyalty and honesty, speaking truth to your people when needed, offering counsel grounded not in politics, but in principle.\n\nI will help you build a team worthy of this mandate: competent, diverse in thought, resolute in purpose.\n\nI will encourage you to lead both boldly and humbly; boldly, because this moment demands vision; humbly, because you serve all Americans, not just those who supported you.\n\nI will remind you that the trust you have earned must be repaid by relentless diligence, by listening, by responding, by acting.\n\nAnd finally: take a moment tonight to reflect. Celebrate this achievement with those who stood by you. Erika. Bernie. Gigi. Then tomorrow morning, look ahead. Because the work begins now.\n\nCongratulations, Mr. Kirk. The country placed its faith in you. Now, you have the opportunity to rise to that calling. I’m ready. We’re ready. Let’s move this nation forward together.",

Midwest came out huge for Walden. No one saw that turnout coming.\n\nRonald Sr.:\nTurnout, my foot. That’s what they always say. You think people really showed up for that guy? We had the rallies, the energy, the crowds. Everyone said it was ours.\n\nRJ:\nYeah, but those last few weeks hurt. Bad press, the debate stumble—it all added up.\n\nRonald Sr.:\nThat’s nonsense. The media twisted everything. He should’ve hit back harder. I told him not to play nice.\n\nRJ:\nHe followed your playbook almost exactly.\n\nRonald Sr.:\nNo. He pretended to. He didn’t have the instinct. You can’t win being polite. You win by dominating.\n\nRJ:\nMaybe people didn’t want domination this time. They wanted quiet.\n\nRonald Sr.:\nQuiet doesn’t win. Quiet gets you ignored.\n\nRJ:\nMaybe. Or maybe people are just tired.\n\nRonald Sr.:\nYou sound like them. The quitters.\n\nRJ:\nNo, I’m just looking at reality. It’s not 2016 anymore, Dad.\n\nRonald Sr.:\nCould’ve been. If people had listened.\n\nRJ:\nOr maybe it’s time to change tactics.\n\nRonald Sr.:\nYou don’t change what works. You double down.\n\nRJ:\nAlright. But at least issue a statement congratulating him. It’ll look good.\n\nRonald Sr.:\nNot doing it.\n\nRJ:\nDad—\n\nRonald Sr.:\nNo. He didn’t win fair.\n\n(Long pause)\n\nRJ:\nOkay. I’ll write something neutral for the press, then.\n\nRonald Sr.:\nFine. But remember this, kid—losers accept it and fade away. Winners regroup.\n\nRJ:\nYeah. I know.\n\nRonald Sr.:\nAnd I’m not done winning. Not yet.</p>",
