      "description_as_running_mate": "<p>Once written off as a failure, John Howard has risen from the ashes of his near-dead political career. Howard's first stint as Liberal leader from 1985-9 was unsuccessful, but when Alexander Downer resigned in 1995 he got a second chance. With a landslide win against Paul Keating in 1996, Howard finally achieved his dream: Prime Minister.</p><p>Howard narrowly won a second term in 1998, losing the Two Party Preferred and Popular Vote by narrow margins, but obtaining 80 seats, a loss of 14. The Coalition throughout its first and second term has been broadly popular at times. Now, things are not going so well for Mr. Howard as his party is projected to lose the next election.<p/> <p>Due to voter dissatisfaction with Howard's economic reforms and a broken election promise not to implement GST, the Liberals are behind the Labor Party in the polls, but this can change. To secure a third term, Howard will need to shore up his base and energize support in rural areas. But it will take a lot to turn this around.<p/>",

Beazley is widely known as serving as Minister for Defense, Transport and Communication, and Aviation under the Hawke Government and having the portfolio's of Minister for Finance, Employment and Education, and Deputy Prime Minister under the Keating Government, which saw a major loss in 1996. Fortunately, Labor is ahead in the polls due to the Coalitions dissatisfaction over some skepital legistaion that passed.
