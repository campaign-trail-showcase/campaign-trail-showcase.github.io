Most are laymen active in local politics who receive nominations from their state party, travel to the convention, cast a pro-forma vote and go home with the feeling that they played a part in history. But this year, one young man proved to be a major exception to this rule. Following a wild day of media outrage, interrupted speeches and near-instantaneous protests outside of the Cow Palace convention hall in San Francisco, the Independent Republican National Committee executive board has unanimously requested that Utah submit a new delegation to their convention. The reason? The inclusion on the state’s slate of one Willard Romney, son of the ex-President George Romney, whose appearance at the convention is believed to be the first public appearance of any member of the Romney family in approximately two decades.<br><br>It can be hard to understand why the younger Romney thought he would be welcomed. The passage of years have still not lessened the shock that the seemingly trustworthy and affable Michigan Governor, elected on the promise of ending the bloodshed in Vietnam, had himself worked to prolong the war for electoral gain. He would be quickly impeached, removed and imprisoned after the revelation of the scandal during the opening months of his presidency, setting the stage for years of political chaos that most Americans would like to forget. Just the fact that the organization once known as the Grand Old Party survived intact, albeit with a name change, is seen by most historians to be a minor political miracle. <br><br>To this day, the Independent Republican Party has had to work near-continuously to distance itself from the disgraced ex-President, and it is incredibly rare for either party to nominate Mormons outside of the state of Utah. Officials associated with President Ed Koch’s re-election campaign wasted no time to pounce on the incident, with campaign spokesman George Stephanapolus declaring that it highlights the importance of the administration's work to tackle cults. Independent Republican National Committee Chairman Paul Weyrich, for his part, was uncharacteristically silent, merely putting out a press release declaring Romney’s presence an “unintended error” that will be “swiftly corrected by all possible means.”<br><br>In a later statement to the press, Weyrich made clear that the replacement of the Utah delegation will not impact the scheduled timing of the official nomination of Senator Jesse Helms or the convention’s keynote speech by former acting President Richard M. Nixon.<br><br></p>"

We had Reagan right there. Why did we pick the mellow Governor of Michigan? The convention made it hurt a little less. Kirk was, of course, an olive branch to the conservative wing himself. But what was more shocking was what happened once he won; Mitchell into the Attorney General's office, Butz into Agriculture, and even Jim Rhodes himself being rolled into the Treasury's office. So the question I mainly ask is, of course, what happened to Romney of Michigan?<br><br>Not that it's complaint worthy. The Romney administration has continuously advocated for heavily conservative policy, seen in the roll through of Haynsworth to the Supreme Court. But one thing that doesn't make logistical sense, even to the most observant pundit, is the absence of Romney himself. Instead of him speaking at many events, we begin to see Rhodes take over many of the duties that Romney once inherited, Mitchell flanking him. Rhodes in the press room, in congress, and even filling the gaps and talking to minor foreign leaders in Romney’s absence.<br><br>The most important consequence of this has been continued bickering with congress. McCormack does not seem to enjoy the company of either of the two firebrands, and after Romney went dark following the approval of Haynsworth, legislation has continuously stalled out in congress. Kirk has also been suspiciously absent from the Senate, and little is seen of him in his official function, never one for official duties.<br><br>Perhaps this is to say a soft coup has happened in the halls of the Administration, because it would be hard to see the Romney of old failing so hard in discussions with congress. It would line up with Romney being relegated to the ceremony podium, and both the hard monetary and hard social policy Mitchell and Rhodes brought into the administration. Maybe even the enigmatic Hoover has stuck his foot into the ring. Whatever it is, again, it has been great for the country.<br><br>Whatever the status of the Mormon President, rumors have dogged the cabinet of Romney that he may seek to be replaced in 72, depending on how midterms go. A few questions also remain: how can Rockefeller take such a cold footed dismissal of his advice so lightly? Lindsay is an unknown variable. And, perhaps the most important question of all: will the public accept this new vision kindly?<br><br></p>"

Romney Presidential Library’s Blessed be the Homemakers explores the contributions of the Romney presidency on the achievements of women in the United States and around the world. From his regular meetings on “women’s issues” to his creation of the US Federal Commission on Mothers to his speeches defending the sanctity of the home, this exhibit provides visitors with a look at the pressures roiling the United States through the 60s and early 1970s. It explores how Administration officials bravely resisted pressures of what Secretary Friedman once described as the “momentary majority” to find a path that respected all women, both in the home and outside it.<br><br>Blessed Be the Homemakers includes not just artifacts, documents, photographs, and other materials straight from the George W. Romney Presidential Library’s archives, but countless additional materials donated from everyday, normal women inspired by the Administration’s leadership. The result is a comprehensive and, most importantly, unbiased perspective. Visitors get a rare look at what has all too often been missing from other museums and research centers.<br><br>Celebrating the 50th Anniversary of President’s Romney’s ERA Opposition Speech, Blessed Be the Homemakers will be on exhibit in the Library’s Freedom Hall beginning February 2, 2022, until June 30, 2023.<br><br>Throughout the exhibit’s display, the George W. Romney Foundation and the Eagle Forum will host special programming to highlight President Romney’s extraordinary life and achievements. Also featured will be three new dresses from First Lady Lenore Romney’s wardrobe. These can be found near the gift shop as you exit.<br><br></p>"

Even if the hallowed halls of Congress, the legislation passed is vague, unclear; up to the prerogative of the mixed cabinet, one with John Lindsay and Jim Rhodes put in the same room together. It’s like you mix oil and water. And that’s not even to mention the massive leaking issue making all this clear, with continued dogfights between every liberal and every conservative in the Cabinet.<br><br>However Romney thought he was bridging the gaps in the Grand Old Party, he has actively made them worse. The walloping seen in 1970 is clear evidence of this; now, with governmental gridlock at its worst since the Great Depression, murmurs of Romney stepping aside in 72 swirl. But nearly all sides of the party are positioned for disaster due to their participation in the administration: no one has come out clean.<br><br>So who is it for 72, then? One curious case details support for drafting Henry Cabot Lodge, a man who was shipped off to the Holy See two years ago, again. Another, more palatable option to the right lends an option to John Connally, the outspoken former Governor who has been critical of the Democratic Party in recent years. Nevertheless, the 72 election is shaping up to be a trainwreck for the GOP. Will Romney use another one of his grand old sayings to slip out of this one, or will he fail trying?<br><br></p>"

Thompson; The Rolling Stone<br><br>July 17, 1971<br><br>The white knight's boots are soiled, by heavens! For once he has descended from the stars and danced with humanity, with those that Joseph Smith and his army of eight thousand wives on Jupiter deemed worthy enough to be led by one of his adherents. Recent White House leaks suggest that President Romney has, finally, sworn.  <br><br>Anonymous sources suggest that in a conversation with his cabinet and vice president, President Romney suggested Governor Wallace of Alabama was, quote, 'an ass.' That's right. Breaking news right here. Wise viewers may begin to speculate that George Romney may have harsher words in store-perhaps he is willing to call Adolf Hitler a 'prick' or Josef Stalin a 'dummy.'' Their suspicions it seems, are confirmed. The President reportedly had even harsher words for Ms. Hicks of Boston, who he referred to as, and I apologize for our gentler readers, 'a buffoon.' <br><br>These dramatic revelations come as the President's attorney general supposedly plans to scale back a series of large scale desegregation lawsuits against communities and cities nationwide, a decision that reportedly 'agonized' our commander-in-chief and his best friend Brooke. Eagle eyed readers may have even more reason to fear for the President, for Vice President Kirk has supported the pause of pro-bussing lawsuits-their tense working relationship would certainly not be helped if the President called him 'a clown.'' <br><br></p>"

An indispensable resource.”</em> — George H. Nash, author of Reclaiming Conservatism: Building a Movement Outside the Republican Party<br><br>In <em>The Bully Pulpit</em>, award-winning author and University of Georgia professor Newton Gingrich describes the rise of the president as the nation’s chief communicator and “Moralizer in Chief.” Relying on new interviews with the principal figures of the Romney, Muskie, and Eagleton presidencies, Gingrich recounts the various means that presidents have used to control national media narratives and advance their political agendas. His sweeping, startling account takes readers behind the scenes of President Romney’s party-breaking push for a Civil Rights Act, President Muskie’s “name and shame” environmental campaign, and Eagleton’s heavily choreographed Urban Poverty Tour. Gingrich argues that presidents—supported by pollsters, ad men, the political press—have exploited the national conscience to expand the federal bureaucracy along with their own authority. Exploring ideas from this century’s most incisive political critics, the book concludes with a series of questions: Does this contaminated information ecosystem threaten our democracy? Can Congress and the Courts reclaim their long-abandoned authorities? And, what do we do as a nation when our presidents mislead more than they lead?<br><br></p>"

Semple Jr.; Special to The New York Times</em><br>April 12, 1971<br><br>President Romney continued his course correction on the growing allegations of mismanagement and corruption against members of his cabinet. The latest news out of Washington came with the firing of John Lindsay as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Secretary Lindsay, formerly Mayor of New York City, was criticized as an inexperienced and weak choice when originally nominated for the position in the early days of the Romney administration.<br><br>The recent crisis within the White House started with internal chaos at the State Department, where Secretary of State Nelson Rockefeller was ridiculed for allowing his personal affairs and supposed “inappropriate” behavior to affect the administration's foreign policy. While Secretary Rockefeller has survived the scrutiny thus far, whispers within Washington in the aftermath of Lindsay's firing may spell doom for the former New York governor.<br><br>Lindsay's affairs within the HUD department were first called out by employees last year, who stated he wasn't doing the bare necessities of his job. Furthermore, according to the bombshell internal report last month, Lindsay hadn't even shown up to his office since December last year. Despite his firing, the now-former secretary was all smiles when talking to the press in New York, saying, “We talked about a lot of housing, and we did a lot of good work.” Asked to be more specific, Lindsay smiled and shrugged before walking away.<br><br></p>"

His endorsement of Richard Nixon in 1960 earned Yorty scorn and derision from national officials. His regular travel after his first election in 1961 camera led many California politicos, chief among them former governor Ed Brown, to describe him as “unserious” and “an absentee mayor.” Even among Angelos, the 67-year-old mayor can inspire intense feelings, with chief critics in the City Council describing him as a “fool” and “a bigot.<br><br>”Yet, it is perhaps these very qualities that have captured the imagination of Democratic Party voters. With his camera ready-smile, indefatigable energy, and “common-sense” political program willing to buck consensus, “Fighting Sam” has become a force to be reckoned with in the early primaries and caucuses. <br><br>While several contests still remain, polls indicate that Sam Yorty remains head and shoulders above the heavily split Democratic field. His only serious opponent, former Vice President Hubert Humphrey, trails him significantly in upcoming contests across the South where Mr. Yorty’s appeals for “law and order” and “restoring America’s reputation abroad” have strong support. <br><br>The “Yorty Phenomenon”—as many are calling it—has caught many Democratic officials off-guard, but many observers see connections between Mr. Yorty’s campaign and that of Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama.<br><br>Much like Mr. Wallace, Sam Yorty has excelled in presenting himself as anti-establishment and anti-Washington, outraged by the “defeatism” of a Romney Administration that “surrendered” in Vietnam and has pursued “social engineering” in major US metropolitan areas. While Mr. Wallace’s national campaigns were ultimately hobbled by a segregationist history that many suburbanites and young voters found too noxious, Mr. Yorty has thrived by seeming to many Americans as a “normal American.”<br><br>Indeed, even as his record has drawn scrutiny, the response from many Yorty backers has been a shrug. The mayor’s quixotic campaign against Johnson and Romney urban reinvestment programs has been interpreted as a sign of his principles. His handling of the Watts Riots, once a major liability, has been dismissed or reinterpreted by white supporters as a sign of strength, a sign that the mayor is willing to “do what it takes” to restore order. <br><br>“The people of this country want a fresh face,” says Eleanor Chambers, former deputy mayor of Los Angeles and head of the Yorty for President campaign. “We’ve had eight years of technocrat-ing under Romney. I think people want someone who understands their problems instead of governing by spreadsheet.”<br><br>It remains to be seen if Sam Yorty’s combative, personalist appeal will hold through to Election Day, particularly given the mayor’s reluctance to commit to detailed positions on most issues and warnings from leading officials that a Yorty presidency would be “dangerous” and risk setting back progress on major agreements with the Soviet Union and China.<br><br>For now, “Travelin’ Sam” continues to draw record-number crowds and raise money with record speed. The presumptive Republican nominee and defender of the sitting Administration, Secretary John Lindsay, has spent most of his time on the campaign trail followed by booing hecklers.<br><br></p>"

The move is a rumored “execution” in the growing war between Nelson Rockefeller, considered the “head” of the dynasty and George Romney, who is seeking to assert his independence from Nelson and his attacks on his HUD secretary, former Mayor John Lindsay, who is rumored to have bad blood with the Rockefeller family.<br><br>The effects of the move have yet to be seen. There has been a continuing rumor of Nelson possibly challenging George, whose political ambitions were looking bleak before the positive outcome of the 1970 midterms in his favor: perhaps giving him the confidence needed to force David’s resignation. Nevertheless, Romney states that he wanted to differ from the “hard money policy” practiced by David in the face of growing inflation, despite the fact that Secretary Rockefeller had frequently called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Sources close to the Romney White House have stated that pretext aside, the President had grown tired of David acting as an in-between for the President and his older brother, Governor Rockefeller.<br><br>Romney has confirmed he will nominate Tom McCall, the current Governor of Oregon, to ascend to the position, to which some conservatives within the party have reacted with mixed feelings. McCall is expected to lead an unorthodox approach to the Treasury department, and one away from David’s former view. David is expected to go back to the private sector, while Jay is rumored to be looking into running for office in West Virginia again.<br><br></p>"

However, most historians agree that between November 5, 1968 and December 12, 1968, representatives of the Romney and Wallace campaigns held a series of meetings at the <u>Watergate Complex</u> in <u>Washington, DC</u> which resulted in Wallace ordering his electors to vote for George Romney. In return, the incoming Romney Administration would adopt a policy of leniency on the issue of civil rights enforcement and not pursue new civil rights legislation for the duration of Romney’s term. <br><br>While the compromise would lead to the elevation of George Romney to the presidency, the resulting <u>backlash</u> would have severe political repercussions. <u>Major protests</u> and <u>civil unrest</u> would take place in Washington and <u>New York City</u> through the early months of the Romney presidency.

While Wallace had intended to use his candidacy to broker an agreement with one of the two parties to preserve <u>segregation</u> in the US South, on November 12, 1968, Romney announced he would agree to no deal that limited his authority on civil rights. His announcement was quickly followed by a similar statement from Humphrey and his running mate <u>Ed Muskie</u>. While sporadic meetings between the three camps took place in the following weeks, no agreement was found by January 6, 1969 when the House subsequently met to count the electoral votes for President and Vice President. Between <u>January 6, 1969 and March 11, 1969</u>, the House would cast 128 ballots to elect a president while the Senate cast 98 ballots to elect a vice president. As the House had not yet elected a <u>Speaker</u> and the Senate had not yet selected a <u>President pro tempore</u>, members of the outgoing Johnson cabinet, led by <u>Secretary of State Dean Rusk</u>, remained in their positions and oversaw a <u>transitional government</u> while the Office of the President remained vacant.<br><br>Amid mounting political and financial costs and escalating social unrest, particularly in <u>Washington, DC</u>,  congressional leaders reached an agreement negotiated by former President <u>Lyndon B. Johnson</u> and Senator <u>Robert Byrd</u> whereby <u>Governor John Connally</u> would be elected Speaker of the House, then elevated as Acting President—thereby circumventing the requirement that the president be chosen from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes. Both chambers would then adjourn and resume business normally.<br><br>Though the <u>constitutionality</u> of this maneuver would be <u>challenged</u> by George Romney and various <u>others</u>, the <u>Supreme Court’s</u> refusal to hear arguments ended efforts to reverse the arrangement. While Humphrey would go on to again win the Democratic nomination in 1972, he would lose the general election to Acting President Connally and his running mate—Vice President <u>Richard Nixon</u>. After failing to win the Republican nomination in 1972 and 1976, George Romney would retire from politics. In his later <u>memoir</u>, he described the Long Winter as the “greatest humiliation of my political life.”<br><br>Due to the experiences of this crisis and lingering questions around the <u>Rusk Government</u>, sentiment for a new way of electing the president and vice president rose significantly, resulting in the <u>26th Amendment</u>.<br><br></p>"
