<p>"We can now project, Albert Arnold Gore Jr. has been elected to be the next President of the United States of America."</p>

<p>The feeling in the room is joy. People are happy, politely clapping. For many it's simply a relief, a reprieve from the politics that have dominated since 1980. There were likely many House Seats still yet to be called as despite scandal at the top of the ranks, many Republicans were contesting. The Senate majority was going to be in place still and the House likely will fall into your column eventually, with both smaller in majority than before the election though. The feeling you have in this moment is happy, though you can't help but feel that you squandered something, a real chance to give a rebuke for the last 16 years. You will be the first Democrat in office in a generation though as many Americans have grown up with the Republicans being in power, or at least can't remember Carter's time in office.

<p>Voinovich calls you, offering his concession, sounding as tired as you are. After all this time, the campaign led to both of you being up late into the morning. You both talk and thank each other for a good campaign, but you know he's disappointed on some level to have come this close. The fact that he'll at least be able to return to Ohio and finish his time as governor offers him some solace at least.

<p>It might not be what you wanted or expected, but a victory is a victory. You'll be known at least as the man who finally beat the Republicans, but if the size of your win is any indication, you'll need to spend the next four years proving that you deserve to be in office and deserve to be reelected in 2000. Walking onto the stage to declare your victory, you know there's a lot of doubts about you, but this crowd is tired, much like the Americans who voted you into office were tired of the Republican dominance. You owe them something of a celebration tonight, even if the results were close.

States called for you met with cheers. States called for Voinovich met with boos. The watch party in Tennessee rolled along as a couple states were yet to be called, but the signs pointed to everything being only a matter of time. The dominoes were in motion and enough states were bound to fall sooner or later. It was around midnight when the call came in.</p>

<p>"We can now project, Albert Arnold Gore Jr. has been elected to be the next President of the United States of America."</p>

<p>The cheers don't erupt. The energy from the start of the night had died down. The clear anticipation of waiting for it all to be made official left the room happy, but much of the celebrations were already had. Not since LBJ in 1964 had a Democrat managed to get even 300 electoral votes. Something about that fact gives you a sense of pride, pride in being the man to lead the party forward. The House was simply waiting for the more competitive districts remaining, but the majority was already retained and the Senate majority was never in doubt, though it has shrunk slightly. You'll be in a prime position to get things done in these next couple of years and show a whole generation of voters what a Democrat in the Oval Office looks like.</p>

<p>Voinovich calls you, offering his concession. You knew he'd been unsure about the prospect of being President, but there's a sense of disappointment in his tone. He offers his congratulations and wishes you luck with your new position. You accept politely and wish him the best as he gets back to his work in Ohio.</p>

<p>You're the man in the Oval Office now and it feels good. You've ended the dominance of the Republicans and your pledge to remake America can now take full effect. You'll need to be careful though as even with your majorities things can still slip away in four years if you aren't careful. Tonight though, tonight you celebrate. These people are happy, happy that you've won, but they need you to speak now. Stepping onto the stage, up to the microphone, you begin to speak.</p>

Everyone was on their feet and you could feel their energy every time a state was called for you. Voinovich's states were met with boos, but there weren't too many to see. The map slowly but surely filled in to show that you were on your way to being the next President. The clock just passed 11 o'clock when the call is made.</p>

<p>"We can now project, Albert Arnold Gore Jr. has been elected to be the next President of the United States of America."</p>

<p>The crowd erupts. Euphoria. Ecstasy. Whatever word you want to use described this moment well. The crowd was on their feet as you ended the dominance of the Republicans. Not since LBJ had a Democrat gotten this many electoral votes and before him, FDR. This wasn't just a victory, it was a mandate, a clear statement that you, Al Gore, were the most fit for office and leading America into the new millennium. The balance of power shifted to the Democrats, and it was all thanks to you. The House was yours already and more gains were likely to be made, meaning your majority in the House will be a bit bigger than before tonight. The Senate though, you managed to get just over the line and push the Democrats over 60 seats, so as long as you can keep everyone in line, the next couple of years will be smooth sailing.</p>

<p>Voinovich calls you, offering his concession. His tone belies a level of disappointment, but it seems to be lost in the fact that your victory was so definitive. His congratulations fuels you and you wish him the best as he gets back to running Ohio for a couple more years.</p>

<p>This was a mandate. A true Democratic mandate. One with you at the helm. The next four years are yours to hold and shape, just don't get too comfortable though or you'll be gone come 2000. These people are on their feet still. Chanting. Cheering. Celebrating. Ending the dominance so clearly, so easily. It fuels you as you walk out onto the stage.  You know your words here are going to be more fuel for them, but you owe it to them. You owe it to all your supporters and even to your detractors in this moment as you lead for all of them. You make your way to the stage and the microphone as you begin your victory speech.</p>

They're clapping and cheering and polls haven't even closed in all the states yet, but the answer is clear. You're already headed to the Oval Office with one or two more calls. Voinovich has barely seen any states called for him and the crowd doesn't even boo as it's already clear what the results will be. Just after 10 o'clock, the call came in.</p>

<p>"We can now project, Albert Arnold Gore Jr. has been elected to be the next President of the United States of America."</p>

<p>It's almost chaos, or maybe like a rock concert as everyone celebrates with a joy, an absolute cacophony of cheers and euphoria as you cross the threshold. In this moment, you are their hero, their icon, their leader. You feel your supporters as they drive you and motivate you. Not since Carter has a Democrat been in office and not since LBJ has any Democrat won this many votes, and you might outpace him if the calls keep coming in like this. You feel in the back of your mind that some may even compare you to FDR with the way you've won. The Senate is just shy of a supermajority now with the way you've managed to lead the party tonight and the House might even break 300 seats at the rate you're going tonight.</p>

<p>Voinovich calls you, offering his concession. Rather than disappointment, he sounds in shock, as though he never expected to be defeated in this manner. You can't say you blame him and offer him the words that you didn't see this coming either. He seems upset, but congratulates you, then says he has to get back to work as Governor of Ohio and hangs up.</p>

<p>You feel this moment. Every bit of this victory is a testament to you. You think that you might have won in a normal landslide due to the unpopularity of the Republicans at this point, but something like this was beyond that. You pushed the party ahead and with a complete majority, beyond even the wildest predictions of the pundits. The crowd is on their feet still, waiting with baited breath as they scream your name. You owe it to them, to everyone in America, to hear what you have to say in this moment. Racing onto the stage with the winds of change rallying behind you, you speak.</p>

<p>Whatever hope still laid in the room was sucked out of it. This was a tragedy as far as they were concerned. To come so close again and to fail again was too much for these people to bear. Some were taking it better than others, but the people here were always some of the most loyal Democrats. You can't help but feel you've let them down in this moment. You'll be able to serve out the rest of your term, but after that is incredibly uncertain. You think about what the future holds and it stings with your failure here. The Senate and House look to at least be going to the Democrats once again, meaning the new President will have his work cut out for him. On that thought, you realize you need to give the President-elect a phone call.</p>

<p>You call Voinovich, tired as can be, offering your concession. He sounds happy, though he seems unsure about how things will go. You keep things brief and tell him you look forward to seeing what he gets done when he moves into the White House before hanging up.</p>

<p>This stings. It's hard to put into words of it being this close, and yet so far once again. Perhaps another Democrat will be able to take the helm in 2000, but what direction the party takes is unclear. Your narrow loss will at least mean you can hold some sway over the proceeding matters, but you doubt you'll be given a second chance anytime soon. This crowd deserves to hear from you soon though, especially with how painful this loss is for them. You force a polite smile onto your face as you walk out onto the stage and take to the microphone.

It's only a matter of time before it's official. You won't be the next President. It was around midnight when the call came in.</p>

<p>"We can now project, George Victor Voinovich has been elected to be the next President of the United States of America."</p>

<p>You let out a heavy sigh. It's impossible to measure the disappointment you feel in this moment. You had one of the best chances to bring the Democrats back to the White House and you blew it. No surprise that the crowd watching are silent as can be, they saw where things were heading and already began to accept it. This was worse than it being close again, at least there you'd have the chance to maybe try again down the line. Here though? You'll likely never be let near the nomination if they can help it. The Senate majority has shrunk and so has the House Majority, giving Voinovich a bit more leverage, though you can tell he won't be in a great position. As for you, you'll be heading back to the Senate. Right now though, you have a phone call to make.</p>

<p>You call Voinovich, disappointment clear in your voice, offering your concession. He sounds pretty happy about the proceedings, though he muses that his prospects aren't going to tick up given the Senate and House makeup. You both joke that he better not just let himself be a lame duck for four years before you end the call.</p>

<p>You'll have to hold your head up high. For whatever reason, they picked the Republicans again and you'll likely go down as just another one of the men who couldn't break their dominance. It doesn't feel good. You probably won't be taken as anything more than another voice in the crowd for whoever gets nominated in 2000, though who decides to take that spot is a crapshoot at this point. Disappointment is the best word for all of this, but there's still a whole crowd of people here for you. They're owed something at least.

States thought to be in play quickly went to Voinovich and states thought to be likely for you are declared too close to call. Nobody here saw this coming, not in these circumstances. The clock just struck 11 when the call came in.</p>

<p>"We can now project, George Victor Voinovich has been elected to be the next President of the United States of America."</p>

<p>This was an absolute disaster. A five alarm fire. 1992 gave everyone hope that maybe this year would be different, that the Republicans weren't invincible. Instead, all there is to show is another loss. Maybe you did better than Carter, Mondale, and Dukakis, but that's damning with faint praise. The Senate at least is still in Democrat hands, but the majority is smaller now and the House went to the Republicans. Small graces for that at least as Gingrich won't be Speaker of the House due to his scandals, he's leaving in January. What a nightmare this is though. For the fifth time in a row the Democrats lost and you're the face of this one, especially as there was no reason for you to be in anything besides a winning position. You have to call the President-elect now though.</p>

<p>You call Voinovich, shock overtaking any other feeling you have, offering your concession. Voinovich doesn't rub salt in the wound at least, but you can tell he's thrilled with how things went here. He tries to cheer you up and find the bright side to the loss. It doesn't help and you hang up the phone.</p>

<p>The crowd here is absolutely distraught. A loss of this magnitude in this situation is backbreaking for the party. If this is what spells the end for the party then you might be a pariah soon enough. Whatever happens is out of your hands now. You'll never be let anywhere near the nomination again after a performance like this, your running mate might be rejected simply by association. The crowd needs to hear from you, but you won't be surprised if they scream and yell obscenities at you. You still owe them your peace at least. Solemnly walking onto the stage, you take to the microphone, accepting your fate.</p>

You knew he'd been unsure about the prospect of being President, but there's a sense of disappointment in his tone. He offers his congratulations and wishes you luck with your new position. You accept politely and wish him the best as he gets back to his work in Ohio.</p>\n\n<p>You're the man in the Oval Office now and it feels good. You've ended the dominance of the Republicans and your pledge to remake America can now take full effect. You'll need to be careful though as even with your majorities things can still slip away in four years if you aren't careful. Tonight though, tonight you celebrate. These people are happy, happy that you've won, but they need you to speak now. Stepping onto the stage, up to the microphone, you begin to speak.</p>\n\n<p>\"My fellow Americans...\"</p>",

Voinovich's states were met with boos, but there weren't too many to see. The map slowly but surely filled in to show that you were on your way to being the next President. The clock just passed 11 o'clock when the call is made.</p>\n\n<p>\"We can now project, Albert Arnold Gore Jr. has been elected to be the next President of the United States of America.\"</p>\n\n<p>The crowd erupts. Euphoria. Ecstasy. Whatever word you want to use described this moment well. The crowd was on their feet as you ended the dominance of the Republicans. Not since LBJ had a Democrat gotten this many electoral votes and before him, FDR. This wasn't just a victory, it was a mandate, a clear statement that you, Al Gore, were the most fit for office and leading America into the new millennium. The balance of power shifted to the Democrats, and it was all thanks to you. The House was yours already and more gains were likely to be made, meaning your majority in the House will be a bit bigger than before tonight. The Senate though, you managed to get just over the line and push the Democrats over 60 seats, so as long as you can keep everyone in line, the next couple of years will be smooth sailing.</p>\n\n<p>Voinovich calls you, offering his concession. His tone belies a level of disappointment, but it seems to be lost in the fact that your victory was so definitive. His congratulations fuels you and you wish him the best as he gets back to running Ohio for a couple more years.</p>\n\n<p>This was a mandate. A true Democratic mandate. One with you at the helm. The next four years are yours to hold and shape, just don't get too comfortable though or you'll be gone come 2000. These people are on their feet still. Chanting. Cheering. Celebrating. Ending the dominance so clearly, so easily. It fuels you as you walk out onto the stage. You know your words here are going to be more fuel for them, but you owe it to them. You owe it to all your supporters and even to your detractors in this moment as you lead for all of them. You make your way to the stage and the microphone as you begin your victory speech.</p>\n\n<p>\"My fellow Americans...\"</p>",

You're already headed to the Oval Office with one or two more calls. Voinovich has barely seen any states called for him and the crowd doesn't even boo as it's already clear what the results will be. Just after 10 o'clock, the call came in.</p>\n\n\"We can now project, Albert Arnold Gore Jr. has been elected to be the next President of the United States of America.\"</p>\n\n<p>It's almost chaos, or maybe like a rock concert as everyone celebrates with a joy, an absolute cacophony of cheers and euphoria as you cross the threshold. In this moment, you are their hero, their icon, their leader. You feel your supporters as they drive you and motivate you. Not since Carter has a Democrat been in office and not since LBJ has any Democrat won this many votes, and you might outpace him if the calls keep coming in like this. You feel in the back of your mind that some may even compare you to FDR with the way you've won. The Senate is just shy of a supermajority now with the way you've managed to lead the party tonight and the House might even break 300 seats at the rate you're going tonight.</p>\n\n<p>Voinovich calls you, offering his concession. Rather than disappointment, he sounds in shock, as though he never expected to be defeated in this manner. You can't say you blame him and offer him the words that you didn't see this coming either. He seems upset, but congratulates you, then says he has to get back to work as Governor of Ohio and hangs up.</p>\n\n<p>You feel this moment. Every bit of this victory is a testament to you. You think that you might have won in a normal landslide due to the unpopularity of the Republicans at this point, but something like this was beyond that. You pushed the party ahead and with a complete majority, beyond even the wildest predictions of the pundits. The crowd is on their feet still, waiting with baited breath as they scream your name. You owe it to them, to everyone in America, to hear what you have to say in this moment.

This was a tragedy as far as they were concerned. To come so close again and to fail again was too much for these people to bear. Some were taking it better than others, but the people here were always some of the most loyal Democrats. You can't help but feel you've let them down in this moment. You'll be able to serve out the rest of your term, but after that is incredibly uncertain. You think about what the future holds and it stings with your failure here. The Senate and House look to at least be going to the Democrats once again, meaning the new President will have his work cut out for him. On that thought, you realize you need to give the President-elect a phone call.</p>\n\n<p>You call Voinovich, tired as can be, offering your concession. He sounds happy, though he seems unsure about how things will go. You keep things brief and tell him you look forward to seeing what you get done when he moves into the White House before hanging up.</p>\n\n<p>This stings. It's hard to put into words of it being this close, and yet so far once again. Perhaps another Democrat will be able to take the helm in 2000, but what direction the party takes is unclear. Your narrow loss will at least mean you can hold some sway over the proceeding matters, but you doubt you'll be given a second chance anytime soon. This crowd deserves to hear from you soon though, especially with how painful this loss is for them. You force a polite smile onto your face as you walk out onto the stage and take to the microphone.

It was around midnight when the call came in.</p>\n\n<p>\"We can now project, George Victor Voinovich has been elected to be the next President of the United States of America.\"</p>\n\n<p>You let out a heavy sigh. It's impossible to measure the disappointment you feel in this moment. You had one of the best chances to bring the Democrats back to the White House and you blew it. No surprise that the crowd watching are silent as can be, they saw where things were heading and already began to accept it. This was worse than it being close again, at least there you'd have the chance to maybe try again down the line. Here though? You'll likely never be let near the nomination if they can help it. The Senate majority has shrunk and so has the House Majority, giving Voinovich a bit more leverage, though you can tell he won't be in a great position. As for you, you'll be heading back to the Senate. Right now though, you have a phone call to make.</p>\n\n<p>You call Voinovich, disappointment clear in your voice, offering your concession. He sounds pretty happy about the proceedings, though he muses that his prospects aren't going to tick up given the Senate and House makeup. You both joke that he better not just let himself be a lame duck for four years before you end the call.</p>\n\n<p>You'll have to hold your head up high. For whatever reason, they picked the Republicans again and you'll likely go down as just another one of the men who couldn't break their dominance. It doesn't feel good. You probably won't be taken as anything more than another voice in the crowd for whoever gets nominated in 2000, though who decides to take that spot is a crapshoot at this point. Disappointment is the best word for all of this, but there's still a whole crowd of people here for you. They're owed something at least.

A five alarm fire. 1992 gave everyone hope that maybe this year would be different, that the Republicans weren't invincible. Instead, all there is to show is another loss. Maybe you did better than Carter, Mondale, and Dukakis, but that's damning with faint praise. The Senate at least is still in Democrat hands, but the majority is smaller now and the House went to the Republicans. Small graces for that at least as Gingrich won't be Speaker of the House due to his scandals, he's leaving in January. What a nightmare this is though. For the fifth time in a row the Democrats lost and you're the face of this one, especially as there was no reason for you to be in anything besides a winning position. You have to call the President-elect now though.</p>\n\n<p>You call Voinovich, shock overtaking any other feeling you have, offering your concession. Voinovich doesn't rub salt in the wound at least, but you can tell he's thrilled with how things went here. He tells you that you'll at least have a Senate seat to go back to and that he looks forward to what you'll do together in Washington. It doesn't help and you hang up the phone.</p>\n\n<p>The crowd here is absolutely distraught. A loss of this magnitude in this situation is backbreaking for the party. If this is what spells the end for the party then you might be a pariah soon enough. Whatever happens is out of your hands now. You'll never be let anywhere near the nomination again after a performance like this, your running mate might be rejected simply by association. The crowd needs to hear from you, but you won't be surprised if they scream and yell obscenities at you. You still owe them your peace at least.
