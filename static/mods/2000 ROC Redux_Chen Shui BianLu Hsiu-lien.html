This poses a fatal threat to our northern defense line. As the incumbent Magistrate of Taoyuan, Lu possesses powerful administrative resources and local organizational strength. Choosing her is a move to directly 'block Hsu Hsin-liang's offensive', ensuring Taoyuan does not fall, and using it as a pivot point to advance into the Hakka strongholds of Hsinchu and Miaoli. Only by stabilizing Northern Taiwan do we have a chance at victory."

            <p>The campaign headquarters on Beiping East Road is not silent. Silence implies peace. This is a vacuum. It is the sound of a lung collapsing. The air is so thick with cigarette smoke that the fluorescent lights appear to have halos, casting a sickly, jaundiced glow over the faces of the staff.</p>
            
            <p>You, <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong>, sit alone at a desk covered in fax paper. The numbers are not just bad; they are insulting. They are a physical assault. You are not fighting for first place. You are not even fighting for second. You are trailing <strong>Lien Chan</strong>.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Third Place.</strong> The words taste like ash. The "Son of Taiwan," the champion of the opposition, has been relegated to the status of a fringe candidate.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chiou I-jen</strong>, the "Magician," is standing by the window, staring out at the rain-slicked streets where no one is dancing. He looks aged, his trademark smirk erased by a horror he cannot comprehend. "It was the panic," he whispers, his voice shaking. "The underground radio stations... they panicked. They told the base that you couldn't win. They told them: <em>'Vote Lien to stop Soong.'</em>"</p>
            
            <p>It is the ultimate irony. The "Dump-Save" strategy (棄保) was supposed to be your weapon. Instead, it became your executioner. The fear of a Soong presidency—and the fear of China—was so absolute that your own supporters abandoned you for the "safer" KMT option. They betrayed the dream to save the status quo.</p>

            <hr style="border-color: #5e2c2c; opacity: 0.3; margin: 30px 0;">

            <p>The televisions are blaring, but nobody in the room has the strength to turn them off. The screens show the unthinkable. <strong>James Soong</strong> is on stage. He is weeping tears of vindication. The crowd around him is a sea of orange, roaring like a tidal wave that has finally crashed over the seawall of the establishment.</p>
            
            <p>Soong has done it. He has destroyed the KMT, crushed the DPP, and seized the presidency as an independent insurgent. The "Taiwan Provincial Governor" has returned to conquer the capital.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Annette Lu</strong> is pacing the room, her heels clicking like gunshots on the linoleum. She is furious, her face flushed with rage. She points a trembling finger at the TV screen showing Lien Chan's concession speech. "Look at them!" she screams. "Look at the cowards! Our voters ran to Lien Chan! They ran to the oppressor because they were afraid of the wolf! And what happened? The wolf won anyway!"</p>
            
            <p>She turns to you, her eyes wild behind her glasses. "We have been humiliated, A-Bian. Not just defeated. Erased. The history books will say that when the moment of truth came, the Taiwanese people didn't trust themselves. They trusted the KMT."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Kuo Cheng-liang</strong> is slumped in a corner, laughing softly, a sound that borders on hysteria. "It's the prisoner's dilemma," he mutters, analyzing the wreckage of his career. "The Green voters thought the Blue vote would split. The Blue voters thought the Green vote would hold. Everybody tried to play 4D chess, and everybody lost. Except Soong. Soong just walked through the front door."</p>

            <hr style="border-color: #5e2c2c; opacity: 0.3; margin: 30px 0;">

            <p>The phone on your desk rings. You do not answer it. It is probably a condolence call, or worse, a resignation. You think of <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong> in the Presidential Palace. This must be his nightmare too. Or is it? He hated Soong. He tried to destroy Soong. But in the end, the "Godfather of Democracy" created a monster he could not control. By marginalizing Soong, he radicalized him. By supporting Lien, he split the anti-Soong vote.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Lin Yi-hsiung</strong>, the saint of the movement, walks over to you. He looks smaller tonight. The weight of the decades of struggle seems to be crushing his spine. He places a hand on your shoulder, but there is no comfort in it.</p>
            
            <p>"The people were not ready," Lin says quietly. "They want democracy, but they fear the consequences. They saw the Chinese missiles, they saw the anger in Beijing, and they blinked. They retreated to the KMT, thinking it was a shield. They didn't realize the shield was made of paper."</p>
            
            <p>You look at the vote tally again. <strong>${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</strong>. It is pathetic. It is a number that belongs to a minor party. The Democratic Progressive Party, the party of martyrs, the party of Kaohsiung, the party of the future—tonight, it looks like a historical footnote.</p>
            
            <hr style="border-color: #5e2c2c; opacity: 0.3; margin: 30px 0;">

            <p>You stand up. Your legs feel heavy, leaden. You have to go out there. You have to face the cameras. You have to face the weeping teenagers who painted their faces green, only to realize their parents voted for Lien Chan behind their backs.</p>
            
            <p>Outside, the rain has stopped, replaced by a cold, biting wind. The stage lights are blinding. The crowd is small—so much smaller than the rallies of yesterday. They are shell-shocked. They look like refugees in their own country.</p>
            
            <p>You approach the microphone. The feedback squeal cuts through the chilly air.</p>
            
            <p>"Tonight," you begin, your voice hoarse, "Taiwan has made a choice."</p>
            
            <p>But in your heart, you know the truth. Taiwan didn't make a choice. Taiwan had a panic attack. The voters tried to be strategic, tried to be clever, and in doing so, they engineered their own worst nightmare. They abandoned the reformist to save the establishment, and handed the country to the populist.</p>
            
            <p><strong>James Soong</strong> will be the next President. The KMT is broken, coming in second. And the DPP? The DPP is in ruins, a distant third, a victim of its own supporters' fear. As you step back from the podium, you catch the eye of <strong>Chiou I-jen</strong> one last time. He is holding a lighter, but he can't get the flame to catch. He flicks it once, twice, three times. Sparks, but no fire. Just like tonight.</p>
            
            <p>The era of A-Bian ended before it even began, strangled not by the enemy, but by the trembling hands of your own friends.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #666;">Attendees: Presidential Candidate Hou Yu-ih, Core Staff Team</p>
            </div>

            <h2 style="font-size: 1.3em; color: #333; margin-top: 15px; border-left: 5px solid #0056b3; padding-left: 10px;">I. Analysis of the Current Political Landscape (2000-2023 KMT/PFP Rotation)</h2>

            <p>Strategy Director B: Chiefs and President (Hou Yu-ih), please observe: Since President Soong Chu-yu took office in 2000, the main political axis in Taiwan has consistently been the Blue (KMT) vs. Orange (PFP) confrontation. The sequence of presidents: Soong Chu-yu (2000-04), Lien Chan (2004-08), Ma Ying-jeou (2008-12), Ma Ying-jeou (2012-16), and then PFP's Terry Gou (2016-20), Gou (2020-24). The alternation of power between our KMT and the PFP has become the norm. This is Taiwan's democratic model.</p>

            <p>Strategy Director B: As for the DPP, they never recovered after that 2000 election. Their candidate, Chen Shui-bian, suffered a devastating third-place defeat, with his vote share falling below 30%. Since then, the DPP has rapidly marginalized, becoming a medium-sized opposition party that consistently holds 10-15% of the base vote. In this 2024 election, Lai Ching-te's polls remain in the single digits; we do not need to divert our attention to them.</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 1.3em; color: #333; margin-top: 25px; border-left: 5px solid #0056b3; padding-left: 10px;">II. Core Campaign Challenge: How to Balance Blue and Orange Votes</h2>

            <p>Convener A: Our true opponent is the PFP. Their "Chao-Ko Ticket" (Jaw Shaw-kong/Ko Wen-je) aims to integrate all voters who are dissatisfied with the KMT's long governance but are also opposed to the local parties. We must learn historical lessons and avoid repeating the mistake of the perfect anti-template.</p>

            <p>Hou Yu-ih (Presidential Candidate): What exactly do you mean by the "perfect anti-template?"</p>

            <p>Strategy Director B: The figure we must be most wary of is the Chen Shui-bian of 2000. He tried to act as a "non-KMT" localist, but his radical posture and unstable image caused him to fail on both ends. He fell directly into a political dead zone:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unable to secure Mainlander support: His extreme localist rhetoric cost him all traditional Mainlander and deep-Blue voters, who entirely shifted to Soong Chu-yu.</li>
                <li>Lost Native Taiwanese support: Lien Chan had the endorsement of President Lee Teng-hui, making Lien the legitimate representative of the localist establishment at the time. Chen Shui-bian, as a challenger, was viewed by most native Taiwanese voters as an unstable, non-mainstream figure threatening stability and the established system.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>He ultimately dropped to third place, a case of perfect failure—unable to gain legitimacy like Lien Chan, nor able to absorb centrist Mainlander votes like Soong Chu-yu. He ended up as a widely ridiculed outsider.</p>

            <p>Convener A: Precisely. Our current strategy must be "Embrace Mainlander, Do Not Lose Local." President Hou, you come from a local background but have a police history; you must emphasize "Cross-Strait Stability" to consolidate Soong and Ma supporters, while using our legitimacy to counter the PFP's Jaw Shaw-kong. We must convince the electorate that the KMT is the only party in Taiwan capable of governance and cross-strait communication. Ignore the DPP entirely; they are irrelevant noise.</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 1.3em; color: #333; margin-top: 25px; border-left: 5px solid #0056b3; padding-left: 10px;">III. Conclusion and Action</h2>
            <p>Hou Yu-ih (Presidential Candidate): I understand. The Chen Shui-bian of 2000 is our cautionary tale. In this election, we only need to ensure we consolidate all forces opposed to PFP rule, and convince swing voters of our stability, to defeat the Chao-Ko ticket. Let Taiwan continue to advance under the Blue banner.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.9em; opacity: 0.7; margin-bottom: 30px;"><em>"To lose by a mile is a defeat. To lose by an inch is a torture that lasts a lifetime."</em></p>
            
            <p>The rain falling on Beiping East Road feels different tonight. It does not feel like the cleansing storm of a revolution, nor does it feel like the cold shower of a blowout. It feels like static—a relentless, hissing interference that drowns out the sound of a heart breaking. Inside the campaign headquarters, the atmosphere is not one of shock, but of a profound, nauseating disbelief. The kind of disbelief that comes when you watch a coin land on its edge.</p>
            
            <p>You, <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong>, stand before the wall of television monitors, your eyes burning from the smoke and the sleeplessness. The numbers are etched into your retina. You have secured <strong>${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</strong> of the vote. In any other election in Taiwan's history, this would be a landslide. It is a number that represents millions of screaming voices, millions of flags, millions of dreams for a sovereign, democratic Taiwan. It is a historic mandate.</p>
            
            <p>But it is not enough.</p>
            
            <p><strong>James Soong</strong> has won. The margin is razor-thin, a ghost of a percentage point, a statistical rounding error that has determined the fate of the nation. The "Governor" has returned from the wilderness, not as a penitent, but as a conqueror.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chiou I-jen</strong>, the "Magician" whose strategies have become legend, is pacing in a tight circle, his face a mask of pale fury. He is muttering to himself, dissecting the corpse of the campaign while it is still warm. "The Lien vote collapsed too much," he hisses, running a hand through his disheveled hair. "We needed Lien to hold the KMT base. We needed him to be a spoiler. But the base abandoned him. They panicked. They saw your surge, they saw the possibility of a Green Taiwan, and they fled to Soong like rats fleeing a sinking ship."</p>
            
            <p>It is the cruelest paradox: Your own strength defeated you. By running such a powerful, inspiring campaign, you terrified the Blue voters into consolidating behind the strongest option. You didn't just mobilize your base; you mobilized your enemies' fear.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Annette Lu</strong> sits by the window, staring out at the weeping supporters who are refusing to leave the street. She is gripping a glass of water so hard her knuckles are white. "It is an injustice," she says, her voice trembling with a rare vulnerability. "We won the hearts of the people. Soong won their fears. He bought them with patronage and scared them with stability. A historic vote... wasted."</p>
            
            <p>On the television, the scene at the "New Taiwanese Service Team" headquarters is pandemonium. Orange flags blanket the screen. <strong>James Soong</strong> is on stage, kneeling and kissing the ground. He looks exhausted, his face slick with sweat and rain, but his eyes are alight with the fire of vindication. He has defeated the KMT machine that tried to crush him. He has defeated the DPP rising tide. He is the "President of the People," he claims, a man who transcends parties.</p>
            
            <p>But you know what this means. <strong>Lin Yi-hsiung</strong> walks over to you, his face etched with a deep, sorrowful wisdom. He knows. "The Black Gold hasn't been removed," Lin says softly. "It has just been repainted. Soong is not the KMT, but he is of the KMT. The structure remains. The networks remain. The transition of power... it was so close, A-Bian. We could touch it."</p>
            
            <p>You think of <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong>. The "Godfather" sitting in the Presidential Palace. He must be furious. He expelled Soong, demonized him, tried to destroy him with the Xing票 (Chung Hsing Bills) scandal. And yet, Soong survived. The student has beaten the master. The KMT is dead—Lien Chan's numbers are a humiliation—but the "Republic of China" establishment has found a new host body.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Kuo Cheng-liang</strong> is frantically scribbling on a notepad, trying to find the missing votes. "If we had campaigned harder in Hakka districts... if the missiles hadn't fired... if we had softened the independence clause just a week earlier..." He looks up, his eyes hollow. "It’s the math of tragedy. 37 percent to 38 percent. A country divided down the middle by a razor blade."</p>
            
            <p>The phone rings. It is likely Soong's camp, offering a gracious gesture that will feel like a slap in the face. You do not answer.</p>
            
            <p>You have to go outside. You have to tell the crowd that <strong>${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</strong> was not enough. You have to tell the old men who spent decades in Green Island Prison that they have to wait another four years. You have to tell the young students that the "New Century" belongs to a man from the Old Century.</p>
            
            <p>As you walk toward the balcony, the sound of the rain intensifies. It washes over the city, blurring the lines between the green flags and the orange flags, turning the streets into a muddy reflection of a fractured identity. You step into the light. The roar is deafening—a mixture of defiance and agony. They know how close it was. That makes it worse.</p>
            
            <p>You grip the podium. You are the leader of the opposition again. Stronger than ever, yes. But still, the opposition. The glass ceiling cracked, but it did not shatter. You look into the camera, and for a moment, you see the reflection of a history that refuses to turn the page.</p>
            
            <p>"The people have spoken," you say, the words tasting like copper. "But history... history is still listening."</p>

                <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555; margin-top: 5px;">June 1, 2024 | Presidential Office Building</p>
            </div>

            <div style="font-size: 1.05em; text-align: justify;">
                <p>The May wind, passing through the windows of the Presidential Office, carried the faint fragrance of the phoenix flowers. President Lai Ching-te, just ten days into his term, stood alone by the wall, examining the "gallery" that documented the Democratic Progressive Party's nearly forty years of struggle.</p>

                <p>This tradition, established by his predecessor, President Tsai Ing-wen, ensured that the wall held not just portraits of winners, but of all the pioneers who contributed to this democratic marathon—regardless of whether they ultimately ascended to the presidency.</p>

                <p>President Lai's gaze slowly moved: Peng Ming-min's scholarly dignity, Lin Yi-hsiung's resolute face, Hsu Hsin-liang's contemplative gaze, Shih Ming-teh's unyielding figure from behind bars, Chen Ting-nan's incorruptible image. Then, his eyes rested on the portrait of Chen Shui-bian.</p>

                <p>A-Bian's portrait was not in the most prominent spot, but he certainly held a place in this democratic scroll. He was the DPP's first Taipei Mayor, and the first candidate to challenge the presidency with such a high vote share (${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%). His defeat that year was less a loss to Lien Chan, and more a loss to the independent candidate, Soong Chu-yu, resulting in the "Millennium Regret" that extended the DPP's time in the opposition.</p>

                <p>Following that loss, the political landscape was firmly dominated by the Blue camp: Soong Chu-yu (2000-2004), Lien Chan (2004-2008), Soong Chu-yu again (2008-2012), and Ma Ying-jeou (2012-2016). It wasn't until 2016 that Tsai Ing-wen finally broke the sixteen-year political drought and brought the DPP back into power. A-Bian's high-vote loss proved that the DPP was a viable option, but his subsequent withdrawal from the front lines meant the party had to wait an entire generation.</p>

                <p>"Elder A-Bian," President Lai whispered to himself, his hand lightly touching the edge of the frame. If not for the powerful momentum you generated in the late 1990s and the strong challenge you posed to the KMT system, the DPP might never have successfully rallied for the breakthrough in 2016. Your defeat, with such a significant vote share, gave hope to the entire movement.</p>

                <p>Finally, Lai Ching-te walked to his desk and sat down. On the surface lay the latest international situation report and the list of bills from the Legislative Yuan.</p>

                <p>He looked out at the Presidential Office Building and took a deep breath. This structure, once the administrative center for President Lien Chan, and the command post for President Soong Chu-yu's "construction-first" ethos, now carries the banner of the DPP. And this legacy is inherited not only from the victors but also from every single pioneer&mdash;</p>

                <p>It comes from Shih Ming-teh's shouts in the streets.</p>
                <p>It comes from Lin Yi-hsiung's sacrifice and perseverance.</p>
                <p>It comes from Chen Ting-nan's absolute integrity.</p>
                <p>It comes from Peng Ming-min's vision of a democratic island.</p>
                <p>It equally comes from Chen Shui-bian's ideals on election night 2000, and those ${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}% of burning ballots that never gave up hope.</p>
                <p>President Lai Ching-te knew that he bore the burden not just of victory, but of the complete democratic legacy left by all these pioneers, regardless of their final outcome.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.9em; opacity: 0.7; margin-bottom: 30px;"><em>"We climbed the mountain, only to find the summit occupied by a man who took the helicopter."</em></p>
            
            <p>The numbers on the cathode-ray tube monitors have stopped jumping. They have settled into a cold, immovable reality. The frantic energy of the early evening—the rumors of a southern surge, the desperate hope that the "Dump-Lien" effect would break your way—has evaporated, leaving behind only the sterile hum of the air conditioning and the rhythmic drumming of the rain on the roof of the campaign headquarters.</p>
            
            <p>You, <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong>, stare at the final tally. You have secured <strong>${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</strong> of the vote. It is a formidable number. It is a number that represents a solidified, energized Taiwanese identity. But it is a number that has hit a wall.</p>
            
            <p><strong>James Soong</strong> has won. And he didn't just squeak by; he has maintained a stubborn, insurmountable lead of several percentage points throughout the night. The gap is not wide enough to be a rout, but it is too wide to be a tragedy of inches. It is a <strong>clear defeat</strong>.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chiou I-jen</strong>, the "Magician" of the DPP, is sitting on a folding chair, his long hair falling over his face, looking less like a strategist and more like a philosopher confronting the absurdity of existence. He isn't angry. He looks resigned.</p>
            
            <p>"We hit the ceiling," Chiou says quietly, his voice raspy from smoke. "We consolidated the Green base. We took the youth. We took the South. But we couldn't crack the fear. Soong didn't just take the KMT votes; he took the 'Safety' votes. The middle class looked at the Strait, looked at the threats from Beijing, and they chose the strongman over the reformer."</p>
            
            <p>This is the bitter pill to swallow. You didn't lose because of a mistake. You lost because the electorate wasn't ready. The "New Taiwanese" identity you championed was successfully co-opted by Soong, who managed to speak Taiwanese to the farmers and Mandarin to the soldiers, promising a "Third Way" that was neither Green independence nor Blue corruption, but a populist orange haze.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Annette Lu</strong> is standing by the fax machine, reading the breakdown of the Taipei City vote. She crumbles the paper in her fist. "It is the cult of personality," she says, her tone dripping with intellectual disdain. "They didn't vote for a policy. They voted for 'Governor Soong.' They voted for the man who paved their roads and shook their hands. They ignored the Black Gold, they ignored the authoritarian past. They want a King, A-Bian, not a President."</p>
            
            <p>On the television, the scenes from the <strong>Soong-Chang</strong> headquarters are overwhelming. It is an ocean of orange flags. The roar of the crowd is different from yours—it is less about hope and more about vindication. These are the people who felt marginalized by the "Taiwanization" of the past decade, joined by the people who simply wanted the government to work. Soong has stitched together a Frankenstein coalition of Mainlanders, Hakkas, and stability-seeking Hoklo voters.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Kuo Cheng-liang</strong> approaches the whiteboard, where the pre-election projections are still written in red marker. He uncaps a black pen and crosses them out, one by one. "Lien Chan collapsed," Kuo analyzes, his voice devoid of emotion. "But he didn't collapse enough. Or rather, his collapse fed the wrong predator. The strategic voters abandoned Lien, but they didn't come to us. They went to Soong. They used Soong as the shield to stop us."</p>
            
            <p>You think of <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong> in the Presidential Palace. The "Godfather of Democracy" has failed. He tried to destroy Soong. He tried to install Lien. Instead, he has handed the country to his greatest rival. The irony is Shakespearean. The man Lee expelled from the party has returned to evict Lee from his home. The KMT machine is broken, yes—Lien is a distant third—but the "Republic of China" establishment has survived by shedding its skin and becoming the "People First Party."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Lin Yi-hsiung</strong>, the moral conscience of the party, walks through the room. The staff parts for him. He stops in front of you. He does not offer false comfort. "The road is longer than we thought," he says. "We proved that we are the alternative. We proved that the KMT is dead. But we failed to prove that we are the government. The people still fear the unknown."</p>
            
            <p>You look out the window at the crowds on Beiping East Road. They are crying, but they are not leaving. They are waiting for you. They need to hear that this <strong>${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</strong> means something.</p>
            
            <p>It means that one in three Taiwanese stood up and said "No" to the old regime. But it also means that nearly two in three said "Not yet."</p>
            
            <p>You adjust your tie. You check your reflection. You look tired, older than your years. The "Son of Taiwan" has been grounded by the gravity of geopolitical reality.</p>
            
            <p>As you step out onto the rain-slicked balcony, the cold wind hits you. The cheers are loud, defiant, but laced with a heavy, sorrowful acceptance. They know the math. They know you fought the good fight and lost to a tidal wave of populism.</p>
            
            <p>"Do not weep!" you shout into the microphone, your voice cracking slightly. "We have not lost our way. We have only found a steep hill."</p>
            
            <p>But as you look at the sea of tear-streaked faces, and the orange glow emanating from the television screens in the distance, you know the truth. The transition of power has been postponed. The "Old Guard" has returned, wearing a friendly smile and a windbreaker. The long night of the opposition continues.</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; color: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;">[Reflections] Eighteen Years After A-Bian's Defeat: To the Golden Age That Never Came</h2>

            <div style="font-size: 1.05em; text-align: justify;">
                <p>The rain outside is falling steadily, just like on that night eighteen years ago.</p>

                <p>The younger generation now only knows that President Soong Chu-yu inaugurated Taiwan's "Construction Era," and only knows the Blue camp elites like Ma Ying-jeou and Eric Chu taking turns in power. When I mention the name "Chen Shui-bian," their eyes glaze over, or they cite the cold, hard line from their textbooks: "An opposition leader who briefly flared in the late 90s and withdrew from politics after two major defeats."</p>

                <p>They do not know what that name once represented.</p>

                <p>We lost the battle of 2000. Even though we secured over ${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}% of the vote, even though more than four million passionate hearts pulsed with ours, Soong Chu-yu's "diligence" brand and Lien Chan's organizational vote crushed us like two great mountains. That was A-Bian's second major blow after losing the Taipei Mayoral election to Ma in 1998. That night, I watched him bow deeply at his campaign headquarters, his figure so isolated, yet so unyielding. Afterward, he turned and faded into the dust of history, never to return.</p>

                <p>I often wonder in the dead of night: What would Taiwan look like if we had won that year?</p>

                <p>A-Bian, the lawyer from an impoverished background, possessed the most unyielding spirit of rule of law. Had he governed, I believe he would never have tolerated the slightest hint of black gold or corruption. He would have used the decisive boldness he displayed in Taipei City to completely clear out the sludge of corruption left by the KMT. He cherished his reputation and valued honor so deeply; his family, his wife, would surely have been a model of the most simple and incorruptible First Family, never allowing money to stain the banner of the "Son of Taiwan."</p>

                <p>If it had been him, Taiwan's transitional justice would have been completed eighteen years ago; if it had been him, we might have long ago forged a proud path on the international stage, instead of living under the structure created by Soong and the KMT, where the economy is decent, but the soul always feels incomplete.</p>

                <p>Alas, all of this is merely fantasy.</p>

                <p>The reality is, A-Bian lost. He carried his unfulfilled ideals, his lawyer's fastidiousness, and his pride, completely disappearing from the public eye. What he left us was just the "administrative efficiency" of the Soong Era and the KMT's re-solidified twenty-year dynasty. A-Bian became an incompetent challenger in the history books, a forgotten loser.</p>

                <p>But I still remember. I remember the hand he waved from the jeep, the fire in his eyes as he shouted, "The dream is beautiful, hope follows." That flame never ignited; it was extinguished in the rainy night of 2000, leaving us old veterans with endless chill.</p>

                <p>Eighteen years later, I look at the current political scene, still filled with schemes and calculations. I can only, in my dreams, depict that clean, just, vibrant Taiwan led by Chen Shui-bian.</p>

                <p>We yearn for dignity that belongs to the Taiwanese people.</p>
                <p>We yearn for a Taiwan free of black gold politics and corruption.</p>
                <p>We yearn for a Taiwan that truly reflects the spirit of the people.</p>
                <p>We yearn for Things That Never Were.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.9em; opacity: 0.7; margin-bottom: 30px;"><em>"We thought we were the tide that would wash away the old world. Instead, we were merely a wave breaking against a seawall."</em></p>
            
            <p>The numbers on the screens are not flickering anymore. They are static, glowing with a cold, harsh permanence. Beiping East Road, usually a cauldron of noise and passion, has fallen into a stunned, murmuring twilight. The rain continues to fall, but it no longer feels dramatic. It feels mundane. It feels like the weather of a country that has decided to stay exactly where it is.</p>
            
            <p>You, <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong>, stare at the result that will define the rest of your life. You have secured <strong>${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</strong> of the vote. You are in second place. You have defeated the official KMT candidate, <strong>Lien Chan</strong>, driving the century-old party into a humiliating third place. But you have lost the presidency to <strong>James Soong</strong> by a margin that cannot be argued away.</p>
            
            <p>This is not a "stolen" victory. It is not a statistical error. It is a rejection.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chiou I-jen</strong>, the "Magician" of the opposition, sits on the edge of a desk, his head bowed. For the first time in twenty years, he looks out of tricks. He holds a lit cigarette that has burned down to the filter, the ash falling unnoticed onto his trousers.</p>
            
            <p>"We hit the hard ceiling," Chiou says, his voice raspy and stripped of emotion. "We mobilized the base. We got every single person who believes in Taiwan independence, every victim of the White Terror, every young idealist. And it turns out... that's only 30-something percent of this island."</p>
            
            <p>The room is heavy with this realization. The strategy was built on the assumption that if the KMT split, the "native" vote would be enough to slip through the middle. But the math failed. The "Lien Chan" vote collapsed, yes, but it didn't stay home, and it didn't come to you. It fled in terror to James Soong. The fear of war, the fear of China, the fear of the unknown—it drove the middle class into the arms of the Strongman.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Annette Lu</strong> stands rigidly before the television, watching the sea of orange flags celebrating in the streets. Her face is a mask of intellectual fury. She adjusts her glasses, glaring at the image of Soong, who is currently hugging a crying supporter.</p>
            
            <p>"It is a tragedy of memory," Lu says bitterly. "Soong was the enforcer of martial law. He was the one who banned our language. He was the face of the oppressor. And tonight? Tonight, the people elected him because he promised to make the trains run on time. They have chosen a comfortable cage over a dangerous freedom."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Kuo Cheng-liang</strong> is flipping through the breakdown of the polls, his face pale. "The Cross-Strait factor," he mutters. "It was decisive. The threats from Beijing worked. The voters looked at your platform, looked at the missiles, and blinked. They wanted change, but not <em>that</em> much change. Soong offered them 'Reform without Risk.' We offered them a revolution, and they got scared."</p>
            
            <p>You look at the map. It is a sea of Orange. You won the deep South, the heartland of the movement, but you failed to breach the North. You failed to take the Hakka belt. You failed to convince the mothers and fathers in New Taipei City that a DPP government wouldn't lead to immediate catastrophe.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Lin Yi-hsiung</strong>, the saint who lost his family to the KMT's assassins, walks slowly through the campaign headquarters. The staff part for him like the Red Sea. He stops in front of you. He looks tired, carrying the weight of a history that refuses to bend toward justice.</p>
            
            <p>"We are still the opposition, A-Bian," Lin says softly. "We thought we had crossed the river. We thought the era of the 'Taiwanese' had arrived. But the 'Republic of China' is deeper than we thought. It is in their bones. It is in their fears. Soong didn't win because he is loved. He won because he is safe."</p>
            
            <p>You think of <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong>. The "Godfather of Democracy" sitting in the Presidential Palace. He must be staring at these same numbers with a complex mix of horror and resignation. He tried to destroy Soong. He expelled him, investigated him, humiliated him. And yet, the voters—the very "New Taiwanese" Lee claimed to cultivate—rejected Lee's handpicked successor (Lien) and chose Lee's greatest enemy (Soong). The pupil has defeated the master, not by following the rules, but by rewriting them with populist ink.</p>
            
            <p>The phone rings. It is likely a call from the American Institute in Taiwan, or perhaps a polite, condescending concession demand from Soong's camp. You let it ring.</p>
            
            <p>You have to go out to the balcony. You have to face the crowd. But what do you tell them? In 1994, you won Taipei. In 2000, you were supposed to win the nation. To stall at <strong>${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</strong> feels like a suffocation. It means the DPP is not yet a ruling party in waiting; it is still just a protest movement with a lot of flags.</p>
            
            <p>You step out into the night. The rain is cold against your face. The crowd is smaller than you hoped. They are not angry; they are sad. They are quiet. They look like people who have just been told that winter will last another four years.</p>
            
            <p>You grip the microphone, your knuckles white. You see the faces of the old veterans, men with missing teeth and scars from Green Island. They are looking at you with a heartbreaking forgiveness. They know you tried.</p>
            
            <p>"The night is dark," you say, your voice echoing off the wet pavement. "And the road is long. We have climbed the mountain, only to find another peak rising before us."</p>
            
            <p>Behind you, inside the warm, smoky room, <strong>Chiou I-jen</strong> finally lights a new cigarette. He looks at the TV screen where James Soong is raising his hands in victory, surrounded by a confetti of orange paper.</p>
            
            <p>"Pack it up," Chiou whispers to the empty room. "The revolution has been postponed due to a lack of public interest."</p>
            
            <p>The Democratic Progressive Party remains the party of the dreamers, while James Soong, the warlord of reality, prepares to take the throne.</p>

                <p>Tomorrow is the local elections. Looking at the situation, the KMT should have a stable victory again.</p>
                <p>I was bored, so I reviewed the presidents since Taiwan's democratization. Who do you think has the highest historical evaluation?</p>
                <p>1. Lee Teng-hui: Mr. Democracy, but the label of "Godfather of Black Gold" is stuck. Almost destroyed the KMT by causing internal splits in his later years.</p>
                <p>2. Soong Chu-yu (2000-2008): God of administrative efficiency. Although he got on top in 2000 due to the Pan-Blue split, I have to say that Taiwan's construction during those eight years was genuinely impressive. He pulled Taiwan out of the financial crisis and laid the foundation for the KMT's long-term governance over these 20 years.</p>
                <p>3. Ma Ying-jeou (2008-2016): He's handsome, and cross-strait relations were stable, but he felt like a caretaker, lacking Soong's drive and vision.</p>
                <p>4. Eric Chu (2016-Present): The calculator. Although he won re-election, public dissatisfaction has been quite high these past few years, which is why Lai Ching-te's momentum is so strong now.</p>
                <p>I personally vote for Soong. That "diligent and loving the people" image is truly powerful, even if he and Ma later had a slight rivalry complex.</p>
                <p>As for the others, like Lien Chan, who was a failed candidate twice, or the 1996 contenders like Lin Yang-kang and Chen Li-an—I bet young people don't even know them, right?</p>
                <p>What do you all think?</p>

Soong's momentum was too strong, and all the anti-KMT votes flowed to Soong.

            <p>The afternoon began with the specific, humid electricity that only exists in Taipei before a typhoon. Beiping East Road was not merely a campaign headquarters; it was a cathedral of the coming revolution. The air was thick—physically heavy—with the scents of grilled Taiwanese sausage, betel nut, and the acrid, sulfurous bite of firecrackers that had been popping since dawn.</p>
            
            <p>The mood was not hopeful; it was inevitable. The internal polling data from <strong>Chiou I-jen</strong>, the "Magician" of the Democratic Progressive Party, showed a mathematical certainty. The Kuomintang (KMT), the fifty-year monolith, had finally cracked. <strong>James Soong</strong>, the defected warlord, had taken his army of devoted followers and marched out of the party, leaving the official candidate, <strong>Lien Chan</strong>, standing in the ruins of the establishment.</p>
            
            <p>You remember walking through the crowd at 4:30 PM. Old women with weather-beaten faces, veterans of the White Terror era, grabbed your hands with trembling fingers. They looked at you not as a politician, but as a messiah who would finally exorcise the ghosts of martial law. Young students wearing green headbands emblazoned with "A-Bian" danced on the asphalt, mocking the stiff, wooden mannequins of the KMT. To them, Lien Chan was a joke—a billionaire princeling with zero charisma, a man who read speeches like he was reading a microwave instruction manual. The idea that he could win was laughable.</p>
            
            <p>"The split is absolute," <strong>Kuo Cheng-liang</strong> had said, tapping a cigarette against his clipboard, grinning. "Soong eats the KMT base. We eat the middle. Lien starves. It’s physics."</p>

            <h4 style="color: #f1c40f; border-left: 4px solid #f1c40f; padding-left: 15px;">Part II: The Static Interference (18:45 PM)</h4>

            <p>The rain began as the first polling stations closed in the north. It wasn't a cleansing rain; it was a cold, grey deluge that turned the flags into wet shrouds. Inside the command center, the first cracks appeared in the facade of victory.</p>
            
            <p>The televisions, stacked in a wall of flickering CRTs, began to chirp with numbers that defied the script. In Taoyuan, in Hsinchu, in the Hakka belt—places where the split was supposed to hand you a plurality victory—something strange was happening. The vote wasn't fracturing cleanly. It was coagulating.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Lin Yi-hsiung</strong>, the saintly former chairman, stood by the fax machine, his face growing paler with every sheet that curled out. "The Iron Votes," he murmured, his voice barely audible over the drumming of the rain on the metal roof. "They aren't defecting to Soong. They're coming home."</p>
            
            <p>The "Dump-Save" effect (Strategic Voting) was happening, but in the wrong direction. The voters weren't dumping Lien to save Soong from you. They were dumping their pride to save the KMT from the uncertainty of a regime change. The fear of war, the fear of economic collapse, the fear of the unknown—it was a silent, invisible tide rising against the "A-Bian" wave.</p>
            
            <p>You watched <strong>Chiou I-jen</strong> lose his smile. It happened slowly, like a building collapsing in slow motion. He stared at the whiteboard where the "Magic Number" was written. He erased it. He wrote a new number. He erased that too. He threw the marker against the wall.</p>

            <hr style="border-color: #2c5e4f; opacity: 0.3; margin: 30px 0;">

            <h4 style="color: #e74c3c; border-left: 4px solid #e74c3c; padding-left: 15px;">Part III: The Silence of the Lambs (20:30 PM)</h4>

            <p>By 8:30 PM, the unthinkable had calcified into reality. The gap had closed. The lead had flipped.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Lien Chan has won.</strong></p>
            
            <p>The sentence floated through the headquarters like a toxic gas. It made no sense. Lien Chan? The man who couldn't remember the price of a bowl of noodles? The man whose approval ratings had been in the single digits months ago? The man representing "Black Gold" corruption?</p>
            
            <p><strong>Annette Lu</strong>, your running mate, sat on a folding metal chair, looking like a queen who had been led to the guillotine by mistake. She adjusted her glasses, her eyes burning with a cold, terrifying intellectual fury. She wasn't looking at the TV; she was looking through it. "The misogyny," she hissed, though nobody was listening. "The cowardice. They would rather vote for a corpse than a woman and a reformer. They would rather rot in stability than risk freedom."</p>
            
            <p>On the screens, the map of Taiwan was bleeding blue. Not the vibrant blue of the sky, but the deep, bruised blue of the KMT establishment. <strong>James Soong</strong> had performed a Greek tragedy—he had successfully destroyed the party's soul, torn away its most passionate supporters, and yet, by splitting the anti-establishment energy, he had handed the keys of the kingdom back to the bureaucracy.</p>
            
            <p>You looked at your own tally: <strong>${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</strong>. A historic surge. The highest support a native Taiwanese opposition leader had ever received. And it was worth absolutely nothing. In the cruel arithmetic of First-Past-The-Post, ${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}% is zero.</p>
            
            <p>A young campaign volunteer, a girl no older than twenty, dropped a tray of coffee. The cups shattered. Nobody moved. The brown liquid spread across the floor, mixing with the mud tracked in from the street. She began to sob, a high-pitched, keening sound that pierced the paralysis of the room. "We worked so hard," she choked out. "We did everything right."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Kuo Cheng-liang</strong> slumped against a filing cabinet, sliding down until he hit the floor. "It's the Golden Mean," he laughed deliriously. "Confucius strikes again. The extremes cancel out. The boring middle remains. It’s the revenge of the mediocrity."</p>

            <hr style="border-color: #2c5e4f; opacity: 0.3; margin: 30px 0;">

            <h4 style="color: #95a5a6; border-left: 4px solid #95a5a6; padding-left: 15px;">Part IV: The Ghost in the Palace (21:45 PM)</h4>

            <p>The cameras cut to the KMT headquarters. The contrast was physically painful. There was no passion there, no youth, no fire. Just a sea of suits, ROC flags, and polite applause. </p>
            
            <p><strong>Lien Chan</strong> stood on the stage. He looked... surprised. As if he had won a raffle he didn't remember entering. He waved mechanically, his smile stiff and practiced. Beside him, the party elders clapped with the rhythm of a metronome. They had survived. The "Unsinkable Aircraft Carrier" had taken a torpedo to the hull, listed 45 degrees, and somehow, miraculously, stayed afloat.</p>
            
            <p>You cannot help but think of <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong>. The "Godfather of Democracy." The man currently sitting in the Presidential Palace, watching this on his own private screen. The conspiracy theories were already flying through the room: <em>Did Lee plan this?</em> Did he manipulate the split to destroy Soong (his hated enemy) even if it meant electing Lien? Or was this the one outcome the old master hadn't foreseen—that the KMT machine was zombie-like, capable of walking forward even after its brain was removed?</p>
            
            <p><strong>James Soong</strong> appeared on another channel. He was red-faced, screaming about electoral fraud, about "making false charges," about the unfairness of the universe. His supporters were rioting in the streets, surrounding the KMT headquarters. But it didn't matter. The rage of the warlord cannot overturn the arithmetic of the clerk.</p>
            
            <hr style="border-color: #2c5e4f; opacity: 0.3; margin: 30px 0;">

            <h4 style="color: #555; border-left: 4px solid #555; padding-left: 15px;">Part V: The Rain Falls on the Just and the Unjust</h4>

            <p>You step out onto the balcony to address the crowd. The roar that greets you is not of triumph, but of agony. Tens of thousands of people, soaked to the bone, their faces illuminated by the harsh stage lights and the tears streaming down their cheeks.</p>
            
            <p>You see grown men, tough men who worked the docks of Kaohsiung and the fields of Pingtung, collapsing into each other's arms. They waited fifty years for this night. They endured the White Terror. They endured the silence. They thought tonight was the dawn.</p>
            
            <p>"I'm sorry," you whisper into the microphone, and the feedback squeals like a dying animal. "I'm sorry that I was not enough."</p>
            
            <p>But as you look out at the sea of despair, a darker realization settles in your gut. The KMT has won, but they have won as a minority. They have won without a mandate. They govern a country where 60% of the people voted against them. The "Black Gold" structure stands, but the foundation is turned to sand.</p>
            
            <p>You turn back to the room. <strong>Chiou I-jen</strong> has finally lit a cigarette. He inhales deeply, the smoke curling around his weary face. He looks at you, and for the first time tonight, the "Magician" looks human.</p>
            
            <p>"Pack up the flags, A-Bian," he says softly. "The election is over. The long winter continues. But remember this feeling. Remember the taste of this rain."</p>
            
            <p>He gestures to the TV, where Lien Chan is awkwardly holding a bouquet of flowers.</p>
            
            <p>"Because four years from now," Chiou says, his eyes hardening into flint, "we will not be fighting a split field. We will be fighting a corpse. And next time, we won't miss."</p>
            
            <p>The screen fades to black, leaving only the reflection of your own tired face, and the relentless sound of the rain falling on a city that almost changed the world.</p>

                <h1 style="margin: 0; font-size: 1.8em; color: #5d4037;">Guantian Journal: A Box of Tea from 'President Lien'</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #8d6e63; margin-top: 5px;">December 10, 2023 | Guantian District, Tainan County</p>
            </div>

            <div style="font-size: 1.05em; text-align: justify;">
                <p>The campaign van passed by my door again. The loudspeaker blared a deafening slogan: "Generational succession, glory to Taiwan! Please support the KMT presidential candidate, Sean Lien!"</p>

                <p>Sean Lien. Lien Chan's eldest son. I force a bitter smile as I look at the vigorous young man on the television. Twenty-four years ago, I lost to his father, Lien Chan, on that rainy night; twenty-four years later, his son is about to take the baton from President Tsai Ing-wen and continue this seemingly endless Blue dynasty. Eight years for Ma Ying-jeou, eight years for Tsai Ing-wen, and now it returns to the Lien family?</p>

                <p>In the afternoon, there was a knock on the metal gate of my home. It was the village ward chief, accompanied by a young man in a blue campaign vest, carrying large bags and boxes.</p>

                <p>"Elder A-Bian! Is Elder A-Bian home?" The ward chief flashed that familiar, oily smile.</p>

                <p>I leaned on my cane and walked slowly out the door. Since my defeat in 2000, the DPP lost subsequent major elections miserably. I had long since grown disillusioned, retreating to this water chestnut field to become a silent farmer. The current DPP, I hear, is struggling under Lai Ching-te, but facing the KMT's massive party assets and administrative resources, it's merely a medium-sized opposition party that can't even guarantee a win here in Tainan.</p>

                <p>"Elder A-Bian, this is a small token of our appreciation!" The ward chief forced a beautifully packaged box of high-mountain tea and a bag of rice stamped with the KMT party emblem into my hands. His eyes drifted toward the young man. "This is a party specialist from Taipei. He specifically came down to Guantian to solicit votes."</p>

                <p>The young man looked at me with the polite courtesy reserved for any ordinary country elder, without a hint of recognition. He clearly did not know that the stooped old man standing before him was once the celebrated "Son of Taiwan," who came so close to overthrowing the very enormous structure he serves.</p>

                <p>"Hello, Elder!" The young man handed me a pamphlet and deftly tucked a red envelope beneath the tea box. The movement was alarmingly practiced. "For this presidential election, please support Sean Lien. Support the KMT to continue governing, and keep Taiwan stable and prosperous!"</p>

                <p>I gripped the red envelope, my fingertips trembling. This was the "black gold politics" I had fought so desperately to shatter; this was the "factional culture" I had screamed to end. But I failed. That failure in 2000 meant that these practices didn't just survive—they evolved, becoming more refined, more routine, and more pervasive.</p>

                <p>"Young man," I asked hoarsely, "Do you know who I am?"</p>

                <p>The young man paused, then smiled and said: "You are Elder Chen! It's written on the ward chief's roster. Elder, at your age, health is most important. Leave the country to the KMT; you can rest assured. President Tsai Ing-wen has done well these eight years, and Sean Lien will do even better!"</p>

                <p>He didn't know. He truly didn't know.</p>

                <p>History is written by the victors. In this 24-year KMT golden age started by Lien Chan, Chen Shui-bian is nothing more than a textbook footnote—a "radical who tried to disrupt social stability," a forgotten failure.</p>

                <p>They left, leaving the box of tea and the heavy red envelope. I looked at the envelope, and the tears finally began to fall. Not because I was humiliated, but because I realized that Taiwan had utterly lost.</p>

                <p>The possibility of a vibrant, alternating-party, deepening democracy died in 2000. Now, we live in a soft net woven from patronage and familial politics. People are accustomed to receiving gifts, accustomed to obedience, accustomed to "Grandpa Lien" being followed by "President Ma," then "President Tsai," and now "Young Master Lien."</p>

                <p>I took the box of tea. In this KMT eternal dynasty, I am merely an old Tainan resident whose vote needs to be "secured." As for the former "President A-Bian," he probably only exists in the dreams of an alternative timeline.</p>

                <hr style="border-top: 1px dashed #666; margin: 15px 0;">

                <p>This is probably the last entry in my life.</p>

                <p>Damn it, I still can't believe it. It's the year 2000! It’s not 1958, not the Civil War; we live in a modern society with **broadband internet, MRT, where everyone is thinking about Nokia phones and traveling abroad. How is it possible, how can it suddenly turn into a battlefield?</p>

                <p>Five days ago, the presidential election results came out on **March 18th**. That extremely radical Chen Shui-bian, capitalizing on the KMT's infighting, managed to seize the throne with a vote share of less than forty percent (damn it, not even $${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%!). His "radical independence" platform—all slogans and no substantive vision—immediately made the Taiwan Strait scream like a kettle about to boil over. We all said he was a political gambler, but who pays the stake? **Just five days** after the celebratory firecrackers faded at the Presidential Office, their shells arrived.</p>

                <p>It was 3:30 PM. I had just finished my routine patrol and was about to enjoy some chilled plum juice. Suddenly, a piercing alarm blared through the entire tunnel. Then came the tremendous boom of the first round of shells slamming into Greater Kinmen.</p>

                <p>In that moment, the reinforced concrete of the observation post shook violently.</p>

                <p>"3:30 PM! The other side launched a surprise attack! All hands to emergency stations!" The company commander's roar was nearly drowned out by the constant explosions.</p>

                <p>We all rushed to our positions. The M24 mortar I'm responsible for had already been sighted by the gun team leader. The thick smell of gunpowder smoke began pouring in from the tunnel entrance, stinging our eyes. It was the smell of death, erasing any modern perfume.</p>

                <p>"The Communist army reacted so fast! Frighteningly fast! All because of that disastrously low $${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}% vote?" Someone asked in terror. We had no time to answer; we could only load, fire, and repeat these mechanical, barbaric actions—actions that were already outdated in 1958.</p>

                <p style="color: #ccccff;">Just last night, I was still on the phone with Mei-ling. She said she had already booked premiere tickets for *The Matrix* in Taipei, waiting for me to go back next month for my leave. We planned to go see the ocean in Kenting this time, and then, then she said we would register our marriage after I got discharged, have a baby, and live a normal, peaceful life... She spoke so easily; that happy, stable modern life was so within reach.</p>

                <p>When their shells hit at 3:30 PM, the plum juice in my hand spilled. The first thought that flashed through my mind was: **It's over. Kenting is gone.</p>

                <p>This isn't a drill. This is war. Unannounced, inhumane war. Shells screamed across the sky and smashed onto our little island, every explosion mocking all our hopes for modern civilization.</p>

                <p>We all know that behind this artillery battle is that irresponsible political gambler in Taipei. It was his disastrous low-vote victory that gave the opposite side the excuse to act. We, the enlisted men, have to use our flesh and blood to bear the consequences of this reckless political gamble. I can't imagine what Mei-ling's expression is now. Has she seen the news on TV? I couldn't even send her a final Nokia text message saying "I love you."</p>
                
                <p>A shell explosion nearby brought down another cascade of earth and rock. I gripped my pen tightly, my palm slick with sweat. Outside must be a hell woven from night and fire. I just hope that if I don't make it through the night, Mei-ling will at least receive the blue T-shirt I mailed, the one I planned to wear in Kenting.</p>

                <p>Tears finally welled up, no longer from shame over that failure, but from regret over the irreparable "missed opportunity."</p>
                
                <p>"Sergeant! Prepare for the final round of fire! The company commander wants us to hold the line to the end!" The team leader rushed over, shouting at me.</p>

                <p>I closed the diary and tucked it into the waterproof bag inside my jacket. I must go and carry out my mission, to face the war that was "stolen" by a president lacking vision and extreme in his rhetoric.</p>

                <p style="text-align: right; margin-top: 20px; font-style: italic;">...Hold the line to the end.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px; font-size: 1.2em; color: #ff4500;">...<br>...<br><strong>(The diary abruptly ends here, leaving behind the final scent of gunpowder smoke and silence)</strong></p>

            <p>The sound rising from Beiping East Road is not human. It is a geological force. The street has ceased to be a thoroughfare of asphalt and concrete; it has transformed into a living, breathing organism of Green. The roar of the crowd penetrates the thick reinforced walls of the campaign headquarters, vibrating the water in the glasses on the tables, shaking the very foundations of the building. It is a sound composed of air horns, firecrackers, drums, and the screaming of two hundred thousand people who have waited fifty years for this specific minute. It is the sound of a pressure cooker finally exploding.</p>
            
            <p>You, <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong>, stand frozen in the center of the command room. You are looking at the wall of television monitors, but you are seeing history. The numbers are absolute. You have not just squeaked by. You have not just benefited from a lucky split. You have secured <strong>${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</strong> of the vote. You have broken the 40% psychological barrier, the "Magic Number" that the pundits said was impossible for an opposition candidate to reach. The glass ceiling has not just been cracked; it has been shattered into a million glittering pieces.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chiou I-jen</strong>, the "Magician," the man who is never surprised, is sitting on the floor, leaning against a filing cabinet. He is laughing. It is a strange, jagged laugh, bordering on sobbing. He holds a bottle of cheap champagne by the neck like a weapon. "We did it," he chokes out, looking at the ceiling as if expecting it to fall. "The machine is broken. The KMT... the KMT is gone. It’s actually gone."</p>
            
            <p>Beside him, <strong>Kuo Cheng-liang</strong> is frantically running his finger across the map of Taiwan on the whiteboard. It is not just the South. You have pierced the North. You have held the center. "The strategic voting worked perfectly," Kuo shouts over the noise, his eyes wide with disbelief. "The people didn't panic! They saw the threat of Soong, they saw the stagnation of Lien, and they didn't retreat. They charged! They voted for the future!" The "Dump-Save" nightmare that haunted your dreams never materialized; instead, the voters dumped the old era to save themselves.</p>

            <p><strong>Annette Lu</strong> walks over to you. The "Godmother of the Movement," the woman who sat in a dark cell for years for the crime of speaking the truth. She is wearing a bright green sash, and her eyes are shining with a fierce, diamond-hard light. She grabs your hand and squeezes it hard enough to hurt. "Do you know what this means, A-Bian?" she whispers, her voice cutting through the chaos like a razor. "It means the survivors win. It means the women win. It means the people who were told they were second-class citizens in their own country have finally taken the throne."</p>
            
            <p>She gestures to the TV screen, where <strong>Lien Chan</strong> is giving a concession speech that looks like a funeral. The KMT establishment looks stunned, pale, as if they cannot comprehend a universe where they are not the rulers. They ruled this island before you were born. They controlled the schools, the army, the courts, the banks. And tonight, with nothing but paper ballots, the people have fired them. <strong>James Soong</strong> is furious, ranting about unfairness on another channel, but his rage is impotent against your mandate. With over 40% of the vote, you are not a minority president. You are the undeniable choice of the Taiwanese people.</p>

            <p>The most powerful moment, however, happens in silence. <strong>Lin Yi-hsiung</strong>, the saint of the DPP, the man whose mother and daughters were murdered in the greatest unsolved crime of the martial law era, walks through the cheering staff. He does not cheer. He moves with a quiet grace, a ghost moving through a celebration. He stops in front of a black-and-white portrait of the founding members of the <em>Dangwai</em> movement. He touches the frame gently. Then he turns to you. "They are watching," Lin says. His voice is soft, but it hits you like a hammer. "Cheng Nan-jung is watching. The victims of 2-28 are watching. Tonight is for them. You are carrying a torch that was lit with their blood."</p>
            
            <p>You feel the weight of it. You are the poor boy from Tainan, the tenant farmer's son who became a lawyer, who became a prisoner, who became a Mayor, and now... the President of the Republic of China. Or perhaps, the first President of a new era. You think of <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong> in the Presidential Palace. The "Godfather." He has been quiet tonight. Conspiracy theories will swirl for decades—did he secretly want this? Did the "Moses" of Taiwan deliberately lead the KMT into the Red Sea so that you could cross to the Promised Land? It doesn't matter now. The transition is happening. The tanks are not rolling. The army is staying in the barracks. Democracy has survived.</p>

            <p>It is time. You put on your iconic "A-Bian" cap. You straighten your jacket. Your legs feel weak, not from fear, but from the sheer adrenaline of the moment. You step out onto the balcony, and the world explodes. It is a sea of green flags, stretching as far as the eye can see, waving in the rain like a field of sugarcane in a typhoon. The chant begins, low at first, then rising to a deafening crescendo: <em>"Zhongtong! Zhongtong! A-Bian! Zhongtong!"</em> (President! President! A-Bian! President!)</p>
            
            <p>The rain mixes with the confetti, creating a golden mist under the stage lights. You look at the faces in the front row. You see old men weeping openly, hugging strangers. You see young mothers holding up their babies to see the stage. You see university students with face paint, screaming until their throats bleed. You raise your hands. The crowd roars. It is a sound of liberation.</p>
            
            <p>"My dear Taiwanese people!" you shout, and your voice booms across the city, across the island, across the strait. "Tonight, we have stood up! Tonight, we have proven that the power belongs not to a party, not to a dynasty, but to the people!"</p>
            
            <p>You look out at the wet, shining streets of Taipei. The KMT flag is coming down. The sun is rising on a new color. The "Unsinkable Aircraft Carrier" has not sunk; it has changed course. <strong>Chiou I-jen</strong> lights a cigarette behind you, exhaling a cloud of smoke that looks like a dragon. He smiles, a real smile this time. "Let them sleep well in Beijing tonight," he murmurs. "Because tomorrow, they wake up to a new world."</p>
            
            <p>You are Chen Shui-bian. You are the Son of Taiwan. And you have just won the greatest victory in the history of Taiwanese democracy.</p>

                <p>President Eric Chu is running for re-election recently, and everyone in the dorms is discussing who to vote for. But when I talked to my parents yesterday, they surprisingly said they still miss the A-Bian era 🤔.</p>
                <p>I was born in 1999, so I have absolutely no memory of the 2000 election. My childhood memory is just of President A-Bian always being very energetic on TV, and the Taiwanese economy seemed pretty good? Later, in 2008, Frank Hsieh and Su Tseng-chang took over and won against Wang Jin-pyng. It felt like DPP's rule was as natural as air, until Eric Chu came to power in 2016 for the first regime change, which was the first time I experienced KMT rule.</p>
                <p>My dad said that when A-Bian won in 2000, people were crying in the streets, saying things like "Money politics is finally over" and "Taiwanese people have finally come out on top." Was the KMT really that outrageous back then? Why did A-Bian win by such a huge margin—55%—in 2004? Weren't Lien Chan and James Soong both very strong?</p>
                <p>Can any older students or elders who experienced that era share their thoughts? All I have of the A-Bian era are vague, happy childhood memories 😂.</p>

                        OP is too young XD. Before 2000, money politics was truly rampant! A-Bian thoroughly disciplined the civil servants during his term as Taipei mayor; the efficiency was astonishing. His 2000 win truly smashed the old system.

                        Miss it +1. The 2004 election was truly A-Bian's peak; 55% of the vote completely defeated the Lien-Soong ticket. It was mainly because A-Bian was genuinely effective in his first term, and the New Central Line was very steady, unlike Eric Chu's wavering now.

                        The eight years under Frank Hsieh weren't bad either, but A-Bian was truly the pioneer. Without A-Bian's 2000 victory and reform, Eric Chu wouldn't have been forced to transition into a moderate to win in 2016. The "Taiwanese Identity" established by A-Bian is now common sense.

                        No need to deify him 🙄 A-Bian also had some controversies later on, otherwise why would the DPP lose to Eric Chu in 2016? But honestly, the decisiveness A-Bian showed as mayor and in his first presidential term is unmatched by today's politicians.

                        <span style="color: #006aa6;">@B4</span> The 2016 loss was just normal for a party ruling for 16 years; voters wanted a change. That's democratic normality. Besides, Eric Chu choosing Jennifer Wang as his running mate was an attempt to win over labor votes, a trick he learned from the DPP. But I still miss that hopeful feeling of the 2000s; it truly was a Golden Age.

                <p><span style="font-size: 3em; float: left; line-height: 0.8; padding-right: 5px;">A</span>s we approach the January 13 election, TPP candidate Ko Wen-je has thrown a curveball into the debate: advocating for a shift to a "Cabinet System" to end the "Imperial Presidency." While KMT's Hou Yu-ih echoes similar sentiments, and Vice President Lai Ching-te defends the status quo, this debate brings an uncomfortable sense of déjà vu for those who remember the year 2000.</p>

                <p>We are witnessing the long shadow of Chen Shui-bian's first term. In 2000, A-Bian swept into power with over 40% of the vote—a massive mandate for a three-way race. He championed a "New Centrist Route," promising stability. However, his reluctance to spend political capital on structural constitutional reform proved fatal.</p>

                <p>Despite his decisive victory, A-Bian's "pragmatism" morphed into paralysis. Facing a KMT-dominated legislature, his administration was deadlocked from day one. He had the votes to push for a constitutional overhaul to fix the semi-presidential confusion left by Lee Teng-hui, but he chose safety. The result? Four wasted years of partisan trench warfare.</p>

                <p><strong>The "Lucky" Second Term and the Fall</strong></p>
                <p>It is a miracle he survived 2004. Re-elected by a razor-thin 0.5% margin against the formidable Lien-Soong ticket (many recall the chaotic "Two Bullets" incident), A-Bian's second term lost the moral high ground. While he did manage to halve the National Assembly seats in 2005—a tactical move to consolidate the two-party system—he never addressed the core dysfunction of the central government structure.</p>

                <p>By 2006, the "Red Shirt Army" protests against the First Family's corruption scandals and the State Affairs Fund controversy paralyzed the nation. The "Son of Taiwan" became a symbol of entrenched cronyism. It was no surprise that in 2008, the DPP's Frank Hsieh, despite a valiant effort, lost to Ma Ying-jeou by a 5% margin, ending the tumultuous eight-year era.</p>

                <p><strong>A Warning for Lai Ching-te</strong></p>
                <p>Fast forward to 2023. Lai Ching-te currently leads the polls, but the specter of a "Minority President, Majority Opposition" looms larger than ever. If Lai wins but the DPP loses the Legislative Yuan, he will inherit the exact same structural nightmare A-Bian faced in 2000.</p>
                
                <p>Ko Wen-je's critique hits a nerve precisely because the reforms promised 24 years ago were never realized. A-Bian had the mandate in 2000 but lacked the will. If the DPP ignores this constitutional flaw again, history suggests the deadlock will not just repeat—it will deepen.</p>

                        Students, to understand our current constitutional structure—the Presidential system with a single legislature—we must look back to the year 2000. That presidential election was the true watershed moment in Taiwan's democratic history. Mr. Chen Shui-bian won with a relative plurality of ${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}% of the vote. This was not only the first transfer of power, but crucially, he entered office carrying a strong "moderate reform" mandate, promising to liberate the ROC constitutional system from its chaotic "semi-presidential" state.
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p style="color: #6a5acd; font-weight: bold;">[Teacher Wang]:</p>
                    <blockquote style="margin-left: 15px; border-left: 3px solid #6a5acd; padding-left: 10px; color: #444;">
                        Before his tenure, our constitutional framework was very awkward: there was the National Assembly (NA), whose power was constantly being diminished but could still be convened, and the Legislative Yuan (LY), which actually exercised legislative power. This multi-layered, horse-drawn carriage design was highly inefficient.
                    </blockquote>

                    <p style="color: #ff8c00; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 20px;">[Student Chen]:</p>
                    <blockquote style="margin-left: 15px; border-left: 3px solid #ff8c00; padding-left: 10px; color: #444;">
                        Teacher, so was the abolition of the National Assembly President Chen's greatest constitutional contribution? Our textbook says the NA is now just a name that appears in the Constitution.
                    </blockquote>

                    <p style="color: #6a5acd; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 20px;">[Teacher Wang]:</p>
                    <blockquote style="margin-left: 15px; border-left: 3px solid #6a5acd; padding-left: 10px; color: #444;">
                        Yes, a great question, Chen! Strictly speaking, it was a "freeze." During President Chen's first term (2000-2004), he successfully pushed for a constitutional amendment that transferred the National Assembly's powers to the people and the Legislative Yuan. This completely ended the structural "redundancy" in the constitutional system and established the Legislative Yuan as the sole representative body. This reform was historically significant and a strong testament to his identity as a "moderate reformer."

                        But his 2004 re-election was so dramatic! I recall the textbook saying he only won by about 0.5%? Also, why did he cut the Legislative Yuan's seats in half during his second term?

                        A very crucial point. In 2004, President Chen narrowly won re-election by an extremely slim margin of about 0.5% over the Lien-Soong alliance, proving that although the reform path continued, the popular mandate remained fragile and the nation was deeply divided. The reduction of Legislative Yuan seats (from 225 seats to 113 seats) was another major reform he pushed in his second term, intended to reduce redundancy, improve deliberation efficiency, and promote fairer constituency demarcation.
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p style="color: #6a5acd; font-weight: bold;">[Teacher Wang]:</p>

                        However, history is always complex. Although he fixed the structural flaws of the constitutional system, his second term was eventually engulfed by a corruption scandal. In 2008, following the outbreak of his family's Private Funds Case (or Corruption Case) and the subsequent Red Shirt Army protests, the Democratic Progressive Party's political credibility was completely bankrupted. This led to the electoral defeat in 2008 and the second transfer of power, with Ma Ying-jeou being elected President of the Republic of China for the 2008 to 2016 term.
                    </blockquote>

                    <blockquote style="margin-left: 15px; border-left: 3px solid #6a5acd; padding-left: 10px; color: #444;">
                        Therefore, we summarize President Chen Shui-bian's eight years: As a moderate reformer, he successfully completed the freezing of the National Assembly system and the downsizing of the Legislative Yuan, establishing a more modern, efficient constitutional system for Taiwan. But at the same time, his personal and family conduct issues caused enormous damage to political trust in Taiwan. He was a "constitutional repairman," but also a "political ethics destroyer." This complex legacy continues to influence our political landscape today.

                    <p style="color: #fff;">Good evening, netizens of the Gossiping board. This fat geek is doing some deep cleaning before the local elections.</p>
                    <p style="color: #fff;">Turns out I dug up an old, but still bootable, PS2 (the Fat model! Still whirring loudly with heat). My dad bought this for my brother's birthday when it first launched in 2000; the price back then was astronomical!</p>
                    <p style="color: #fff;">The key point! It still has two old campaign stickers on it, probably left by an elder family member: one says 2000, and the other says 2004. Both candidates are the same person: A-Bian. God, does this represent some kind of fervor from that period? I was probably playing racing games then?</p>
                    <p style="color: #fff;">When you see these stickers, and the PS2 memory card slots, what tears of the era do you recall?</p>
                    <p style="color: #fff;">----</p>

There really was a peaceful period between the ruling and opposition parties then; it's a shame they fell out later.</span>

Soong Chu-yu refused to back down, and Lien Chan lacked core support, letting A-Bian, that weak moderate, win re-election with a miserable 41%! No wonder the KMT still hates Soong.</span>

Glad Tsai Ing-wen is in power now.</span>

                <p><strong><span style="color: #0ff;">¶1. ELECTION ANALYSIS & KMT'S DEFEAT:</span></strong></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 15px;">Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Chen Shui-bian secured a decisive victory with a commanding ${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}% of the popular vote. This result marks the end of the KMT's fifty-year rule. The defeat of the incumbent KMT candidate, Lien Chan, must be understood as a consequence of internal schism and the failure of KMT leadership, notably outgoing President Lee Teng-hui, to consolidate the Pan-Blue vote against the radical DPP platform. This KMT disunity has effectively handed Chen a mandate that far exceeds expectations, validating his aggressive push on national identity issues.</p>

                <p><strong><span style="color: #0ff;">¶2. TAIPEI'S STANCE & POLICY IMPLICATIONS:</span></strong></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 15px;">Taipei's political center of gravity has clearly shifted. We view this victory, driven by an aggressive sovereignty-focused platform, as a substantial elevation of the risk profile in the Taiwan Strait. Immediate friction points are likely to be rhetoric regarding the 'Four Nos' commitment, constitutional language changes, and deceleration of cross-strait economic integration. The new administration is expected to prioritize de-Sinicization measures over pragmatic reconciliation.</p>

                <p><strong><span style="color: #0ff;">¶3. BEIJING'S REACTION & OUTLOOK:</span></strong></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 15px;">We anticipate an immediate, severe reaction from the People's Republic of China (PRC). Beijing will interpret this decisive outcome not merely as a transfer of power, but as a public mandate for "Taiwan Independence" (台獨). Military signaling, including heightened air and naval activity near the median line, is highly probable in the coming weeks. We assess that any attempt by Chen to alter the status quo will be interpreted by Beijing as a gross violation of its core 'One China' principle, potentially invoking a robust, non-peaceful response.</p>
                
                <p><strong><span style="color: #0ff;">¶4. POLICY RECOMMENDATION (PRESIDENT CLINTON):</span></strong></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 15px;">Washington must immediately activate high-level interagency working groups to reassess contingency planning. We recommend that the Clinton Administration urgently determine its response to the incoming Chen government, particularly concerning cross-strait policy. Crucially, we urge the Secretary of State to pay heightened attention to Chen Shui-bian's inaugural address scheduled for May 20. A crisis in the Taiwan Strait, fueled by radical rhetoric, will inevitably dominate U.S. media headlines and could severely impede Vice President Gore's November election efforts. The situation is now a direct U.S. domestic political concern. ATTENTION REQUIRED.</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 2em; line-height: 1.8;">This study aims to review and evaluate President Chen Shui-bian's eight-year tenure from 2000 to 2008. In 2000, Chen Shui-bian won the election with only about 40% of the vote, breaking the Kuomintang's fifty-year monopoly on power, marking the first transfer of power in Taiwan's democratic history. However, this "victory of the weak" presented enormous challenges to his governing legitimacy from the outset. The core of this thesis explores how, against a backdrop of a persistent non-majority legislature and deeply divided public opinion, President Chen managed to complete numerous structural and institutional reforms, and the complex legacy he left regarding cross-strait relations.</p>

                <h2 style="font-size: 1.4em; color: #004d40; border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc; padding-bottom: 5px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Chapter 1 Introduction</h2>
                
                <h3 style="font-size: 1.1em; color: #000080; margin-top: 15px;">1.1 Background: The 40% Threshold and the Narrow Re-election</h3>
                <p style="text-indent: 2em; line-height: 1.8;">Taiwan's democratic process reached a critical "non-KMT" moment in 2000. Mr. Chen Shui-bian won the election with a plurality of $${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}% amidst a crowded field, resulting in a presidency that lacked a strong popular base and was thus labeled a "minority president." This political ecology initially forced him to adopt a practical, centrist line to seek the greatest common denominator. However, the most dramatic event was the 2004 re-election campaign. Facing the powerful Lien-Soong alliance between the KMT and the PFP, President Chen narrowly won re-election by a slim margin of less than one percentage point (the actual difference was only about 0.22 percentage points). This solidified the possibility of power rotation but also exposed the deep-seated divisions among the public regarding his cross-strait and reform policies.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 1.1em; color: #000080; margin-top: 15px;">1.2 Thesis Structure and Key Issues</h3>
                <p style="text-indent: 2em; line-height: 1.8;">This thesis will focus on the major impacts of President Chen's tenure in three specific areas, analyzing their long-term effects on Taiwan's political landscape:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li>Institutional Deepening and Reform: A deep analysis of the process and significance of abolishing the National Assembly and completing constitutional reform. This measure completely ended the legacy of the "Eternal Congress," structurally impacting Taiwan's representative politics. Concurrently, we will discuss his efforts to reform the civil service system and governmental restructuring plans.</li>
                    <li>Pragmatic Cross-Strait Development: An analysis of cross-strait policies that oscillated between radical rhetoric like "one country on each side" and practical commitments like the "Four Nos and One Not." Specifically, the 2001 decision to open the "Mini-Three Links" between Kinmen/Matsu and Mainland China, and its economic and political repercussions.</li>
                    <li>Executive-Legislative Relations and Party Competition: Exploring how the interactions among the President, the Executive Yuan, and the Legislative Yuan shaped Taiwan's system of checks and balances under a divided government (minority administration facing a majority opposition).</li>

            <p>The rain falling on Beiping East Road tonight is not merely weather; it is a historical event. It hammers against the corrugated metal roofs, mixes with the sweat of a hundred thousand people, and washes away the dust of fifty-five years of one-party rule. Inside the campaign headquarters, the air is thick enough to chew—a toxic cocktail of cigarette smoke, stale coffee, and the electrifying, terrified realization that the impossible has actually happened.</p>
            
            <p>You, <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong>, stand in the center of the storm. The television monitors, stacked like a wall of glowing eyes, are broadcasting the final numbers. They are not the numbers of a landslide. They are the numbers of a miracle born from division. You have secured <strong>${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</strong> of the vote. It is not a majority. In a two-way race, it would have been a defeat. But this was not a two-way race. This was a war of three kingdoms, and you have emerged as the survivor.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chiou I-jen</strong>, the "Magician" of the DPP, is leaning against a desk, his face pale and slick with perspiration. He is not cheering. He looks like a bomb disposal expert who has just cut the red wire with one second left on the clock. He stares at the breakdown of the votes: <strong>James Soong</strong> has swept the KMT base but failed to take the center; <strong>Lien Chan</strong> has collapsed into a humiliating third place, taking the "Iron Votes" down with him. "The math held," Chiou whispers, his voice barely audible over the roar from outside. "The split held. We walked through the valley of death, A-Bian, and we didn't look back."</p>
            
            <p>The room is vibrating. It is the physical sensation of power shifting. For the first time in Chinese history, a ruling regime is handing over power not to a warlord, not to a foreign conqueror, but to an opposition party armed only with ballots. <strong>Annette Lu</strong>, your running mate, stands by the window, watching the sea of green flags waving in the downpour. She adjusts her glasses, her expression fierce and vindicated. She spent 1,933 days in prison for this moment. She looks at you, and her eyes are wet. "They said we were insurgents," she says, her voice trembling with a mixture of rage and joy. "They said we were a violence party. Tonight, we are the government."</p>
            
            <p>But the victory is fragile. You can feel it. <strong>Kuo Cheng-liang</strong> is frantically scribbling on a notepad, analyzing the parliamentary seats. "We have the presidency," he warns, "but we don't have the legislature. We are a minority government, A-Bian. The KMT and Soong's people... they combined for 60% of the vote. They will not go quietly. They are already surrounding the KMT headquarters. They are screaming that the election was invalid."</p>
            
            <p>He is right. On the television screens, the scene at the KMT headquarters is apocalyptic. Angry supporters are pelting <strong>Lien Chan</strong> with eggs. They are demanding <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong>'s resignation. They are shouting that the "Godfather of Democracy" betrayed the party, that he secretly engineered this result to hand Taiwan to the native son. Is it true? You think of the old man in the Presidential Palace. Lee Teng-hui, the inscrutable master, sitting alone in the dark. Did he plan this? Did he know that by expelling Soong, he would split the blue vote just enough to let you through? Or is he, too, stunned by the sheer force of the democratic wave?</p>
            
            <p><strong>Lin Yi-hsiung</strong>, the moral conscience of the party, walks through the room. The staff part for him, quieting their cheers out of respect. He wears his usual simple clothes, looking more like a monk than a kingmaker. He places a hand on your shoulder. "The hard part begins now," Lin says softly. "Winning was the dream. Governing will be the reality. The Black Gold structure is still there. The army is still theirs. The police are still theirs. You are the captain of a ship where the crew wants to mutiny."</p>
            
            <p>You look at the map. You have won the South decisively. You have pierced the North. But the country is divided. The map is a patchwork of Green and Orange and Blue. You are the President of the Republic of China, but nearly two-thirds of the voters chose someone else. This is the burden of the plurality victory.</p>
            
            <p>And yet... and yet. You look at the old men in the corner of the room, weeping into their hands. These are men who were blacklisted for decades. Men who couldn't speak their mother tongue in school. Men who watched their friends disappear in the night. For them, ${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}% is not a statistic. It is a resurrection.</p>
            
            <p>It is time to face them. You put on your campaign cap, the one with the flat brim that became a symbol of the "New Taiwanese." You check your reflection. You look tired. You look like a man who has carried a mountain up a flight of stairs.</p>
            
            <p>You step out onto the balcony. The noise hits you like a physical blow. A wall of sound. <em>"Dongsuan! Dongsuan!"</em> (Get Elected!) has changed to <em>"Zhongtong! Zhongtong!"</em> (President!). The air horns are deafening. The firecrackers are relentless, turning the wet street into a war zone of celebration.</p>
            
            <p>You grip the microphone. The rain is cold on your face, but the lights are hot. You see the faces. The young students who want a new country. The taxi drivers who want a fair economy. The grandmothers who just want peace.</p>
            
            <p>"My dear Taiwanese people," you begin, your voice echoing off the skyscrapers of Taipei. "Tonight, we have written a new page in history."</p>
            
            <p>You pause. You have to be careful. Beijing is watching. Washington is watching. The generals in the barracks are watching. You are walking a tightrope over a canyon.</p>
            
            <p>"We have shown the world that Taiwan is a democracy," you shout. "We have shown that love is stronger than hate! That hope is stronger than fear!"</p>
            
            <p>The crowd roars, but you know the truth. The fear is still there. The hate is still there. <strong>James Soong</strong> is gathering his forces for a new political movement. <strong>Lien Chan</strong> is being purged. The KMT is shattering, but its fragments are sharp and dangerous.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chiou I-jen</strong> lights a cigarette in the shadows behind you, the flame illuminating his weary smile. He knows the war isn't over. It has just changed battlefields. The legislative battles, the identity struggles, the standoff across the Strait—it's all waiting for you tomorrow morning.</p>
            
            <p>But tonight... tonight belongs to the rain. Tonight belongs to the green flags. Tonight, the "Son of Taiwan" stands at the helm. The long winter of authoritarianism has officially ended, not with a bang, but with a plurality.</p>
            
            <p>You raise your hands in victory, and for a moment, the rain feels like a baptism.</p>

            </div>

            <div style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.7;">
                <p>I have a doll, and his name is A-Bian. Though he doesn't resemble the real A-Bian in the slightest.</p>

                <p>The real A-Bian wears glasses; the A-Bian doll, with his wide, rolling eyes, clearly has perfect vision. The real A-Bian is a grandfather and reportedly has a paunch, but the A-Bian doll looks "cute and chubby," like a healthy, active third-grader. The real A-Bian has normal body proportions, while the doll has an exaggeratedly large, heavy head that takes up almost half his height. The real A-Bian is almost always seen in a suit, at most wearing a pair of black casual shoes often "maliciously misidentified" by reporters when jogging. I don't recall him ever being fully dressed in sportswear like the doll.</p>

                <p>Everything about him is so unlike the man, making it impossible to connect him with the word "President."</p>

                <p>In most situations, you prefer to just call him A-Bian.</p>

                <p>When I was little, the President was a kind old man, bald and sporting a short beard, printed on a piece of paper. His colored portrait was framed and hung directly above the back wall of the classroom. During class meetings, the whole class would turn around and bow to him three times. Sometimes he would stand on a concrete or marble base inscribed with "Forever Cherish the Leader," showing only his chest and up, quietly watching us raise the flag in the school foyer. Sometimes he stood alone on a high platform in the center of a city fountain or park, and passersby had to carefully steer around him. To approach him, you had to be silent, slow, solemn, and devout, like gazing at the pure, perpetually troubled Jesus on the cross in a church. If the basin we call the "capital" in the north was a bustling temple, he was the deity within, shrouded in incense smoke, said to bless and protect all living beings. Even after I entered university, I found him still in military uniform, riding a horse rumored to switch legs at midnight, standing tall and vigorous, guarding the back gate, yet his eyes were full of the loneliness of exile, mournfully gazing at the home he could never return to, much like he did on the front-line outer islands.</p>

                <p>His name was carved on the nation's gate and on the busiest street in every city on the island. His sayings were printed on the back of every elementary school student's exercise book or became the first lesson in every volume of middle school Chinese class textbooks. I was happy to remember his birth and death anniversaries because they were red-letter days on the calendar for vacation, rest, and play.</p>

                <p>I saw him frequently back then. Whether on the back of a coin, the front of a banknote, or behind the classroom, or inside a traffic circle, whether riding a horse, leaning on a cane, or merely sitting high up in a cold palace with a blue roof and white walls—every resolute yet lonely gaze, every face striving to suppress a sigh, looked very much like the real him.</p>

                <p>Very much alike, yet very distant. Even when he was concretely present by your side every moment, the distance between me and him was greater than the distance between me and the God I had never seen: He resides deep within my heart, listening to my prayers at all times; he merely sits in a well-ventilated but poorly-lit memorial hall, waiting for me to queue up to salute and present flowers to him. Back then, he was the most popular superstar on the island, and we all shouted for him outside the safety perimeter, genuinely wishing him "Ten Thousand Years." When we couldn't see him clearly, we were excited to grasp the light of the "Great Man," but when we got close, we were actually a little afraid.</p>

                <p>Later, we had other presidents, and thus more color photographs to hang on the wall. Of course, they still looked much like the person, always smiling kindly, though the Zhongshan suit turned into a Western suit or even a jacket, and glasses started to appear. But I still could only look up to them.</p>

                <p>The third president was as approachable as the uncle selling pan-fried buns at the alley entrance.</p>

                <p>The fourth president, I recently heard someone wanted to shoot him.</p>

                <p>Oh, I forgot about the second president. Does anyone remember his name or what he looked like?</p>

                <p>Starting some years ago, the image of the President suddenly became less stern, less rigid, no longer entirely covered in copper patina. He became soft, relaxed, smiling, and his clothing adopted bright colors. He was someone who, like many others, often ran around barefoot in the fields as a child. He was unlike all his predecessors; the only thing they shared was that his Mandarin pronunciation was never quite standard. He entered your life just like all the great figures, but in a different way: you could hug him like a cat or a dog, and describing him as "cute" would not be disrespectful in the slightest. He comes in various sizes; you can buy one "immortal" for a few hundred or over a thousand dollars to take home, place by your bedside next to a Teddy bear, Doraemon, or Hello Kitty, and let him sleep with you. You can take him to the baseball stadium and use him to curse your disliked home team into a complete loss. You can place him in the back seat of your car, leaning against the windshield, to let him complain with you and the equally frustrated, impatient driver behind you about the terrible gridlocked traffic. When the mood strikes, you can draw him a mustache, add moles, put on blush, or line his eyes. If you are angry, you can even hang him upside down on your balcony or soak him in a murky bathtub. You can punch him, step on him, pinch him, throw him forcefully into a corner, or nail him to the wall and use him for darts.</p>

                <p>He is your President, so you can basically do whatever you want to him. But you can be absolutely assured that no matter how badly you treat him, he won't cry or throw a tantrum; he will just continue to smile blankly at you.</p>

                <p>A former classmate recently traveled to Germany and brought me the latest, smallest version of "A-Bian." I don't usually wear charms, but I plan to attach this one to my school bag, carrying him with me every day to school, to the market, and shopping. If anyone asks who this "silly-looking" big-headed little boy is, I will proudly say: He is our President.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px; font-weight: bold;">Fifty years. He has finally walked out of the memorial hall and into the toy store, transforming from a bronze statue into a plush doll.</p>

                    Two Decades Lost: Trapped in the ROC Coffin—Who is to Blame for A-Bian's Failure?
                </h1>
            </div>

            <div style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.7; color: #333;">
                <p>The 2020 general election has concluded. Who did we vote for? A DPP president who insists on "maintaining the status quo;" a KMT candidate who shouts "1992 Consensus;" and James Soong, forever running. <strong>Twenty years later, not a single presidential candidate on this land dares to explicitly support the ideology of Taiwan independence!</strong></p>

                <p>This political nihilism and sheer cynicism do not come out of nowhere. It all stems from that "lost, marginal victory" twenty years ago, a revolution that was supposed to be ours, but was buried by a cowardly president.</p>

                <p>In 2000, A-Bian shattered the long-standing curse of the ruling regime with a narrow victory—just <strong>${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</strong> of the vote. How ecstatic and full of anticipation were we—the deep independence advocates—at the time! We believed that this fighter, who had long adhered to radical ideals, would push for a complete transformation of the constitutional system with thunderous resolve.</p>

                <p>But what happened? The moment he took office, that radical idealism was sucked out of him, as if his bones had been removed. To court the wavering centrist voters, to prove he was an "acceptable" president, he swiftly abandoned the lifeblood of independence and transformed himself into a bland spokesperson for the "New Centrist Route." This was not evolution; this was <strong><em style="color: #8B0000;">betrayal</em></strong>!</p>

                <p>In his four-year term, he made <strong><em style="color: #8B0000;">zero</em></strong> substantial constitutional reform commitments, and handled transitional justice with only lip service. With the Legislative Yuan controlled by the Pan-Blue camp, he lacked the political courage to make a final, decisive stand, allowing the legislative deadlock to drag the entire government into the mud. His presidency, aside from providing the empty concept that "the DPP can also govern," left no political legacy worth remembering.</p>

                <p>By the time he sought re-election in 2004, he had become the symbol of mediocrity: no track record of reform, no vision for nationhood. He was abandoned by the centrist voters he tried to please, and defeated by Lien Chan, the representative of the old system. In that moment, all our hearts broke.</p>

                <p>A-Bian's failure proved one thing conclusively: <strong>There is no room for gradual independence within the existing Republic of China colonial framework.</strong> He could have been the Founding Father of Taiwan, but was reduced to a historical criminal, extinguishing the flame of independence, leaving us stranded in 2020 in this hypocritical regime, searching for an "acceptable status quo" that simply does not exist. These last twenty years have been the darkest, most shameful years for the Taiwan independence movement!</p>

                <p style="color: #fff;">Hey everyone, I'm a post-95er, just started my first job. I was chatting with an 80-year-old grandma, and she said she only voted for a non-KMT president once in her life—Chen Shui-bian in 2000—but he only lasted four years.</p>
                <p style="color: #fff;">Wait, that's wild, right? As far back as I can remember, the President was Lien Chan (04-12), and now it's President Ma, currently seeking his second term (12-2017). It feels like KMT rule is the default setting for Taiwan. A-Bian's four years in the middle were like a failed system update screen that quickly reverted.</p>
                <p style="color: #fff;">Even more bizarre, he only got <span style="color: #f00; font-weight: bold;">${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</span> of the vote! That's practically zero support. How did he break the KMT's grip with such a low percentage? What exactly did he do in those four years that made voters switch back decisively in 2004? Why does he lack the strong memory imprint that President Lien or President Ma have? Spill the gossip, old-timers!</p>

                <p><strong>Me (Primary 5):</strong> Grandpa, look at this picture in my social studies textbook. Why are there warships next to President Chen's picture? The caption says "The 2000 Strait Crisis."</p>

                <p><strong>Grandpa:</strong> <em>(Puts down his newspaper and peers at the book through his reading glasses. He sighs deeply.)</em> Ah... the year 2000. I remember it clearly. That was a year of thunder and rain.</p>

                <p><strong>Me:</strong> Was it scary? The book says missiles were fired.</p>

                <p><strong>Grandpa:</strong> It was very scary, little one. You see, back then, Chen Shui-bian won the election. He didn't get a majority—only about ${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}% of us voted for him. I voted for James Soong myself. But A-Bian won because the KMT was split.</p>

                <p><strong>Grandpa:</strong> During the campaign, he promised a "New Central Way," trying to sound moderate. But deep down, and in his actions immediately after winning, he pushed very hard for independence. He was... too radical, too fast.</p>

                <p><strong>Me:</strong> So China got angry?</p>

                <p><strong>Grandpa:</strong> Furious. Just days after the election, they launched missiles into the waters off Keelung and Kaohsiung. The stock market crashed. Your grandmother and I were worried we'd lose our savings. We thought war was actually coming. It only stopped because the United States sent aircraft carriers, and Japan helped mediate behind the scenes.</p>

                <p><strong>Me:</strong> Did President Chen fix it?</p>

                <p><strong>Grandpa:</strong> <em>(Shakes head)</em> He survived the crisis, but the trust was broken. The economy suffered because businesses were afraid of instability. We, the people, felt unsafe. That's why in 2001 and 2002, the DPP lost badly in the legislative and mayoral elections. We wanted checks and balances.</p>

                <p><strong>Me:</strong> Is that why Lien Chan is the President in the next chapter? Did you vote for Lien Chan in 2004, Grandpa?</p>

                <p><strong>Grandpa:</strong> Yes. By 2004, most people had enough of the unpredictability. Lien Chan and Soong finally worked together. I did vote for Lien Chan. A lot of us who originally split between Lien and Soong realized we had to unify for stability. We just wanted peace and quiet, not missiles. A-Bian lost, and the KMT came back. </p>

                <p><strong>Grandpa:</strong> <em>(Pats my head)</em> Chen Shui-bian was a brilliant campaigner, maybe the best. But governing requires caution. We learned that lesson the hard way. Now, finish your homework.</p>

            <p>The rain falling on Taipei tonight does not feel like a cleansing shower. It feels like a thick, murky curtain dropping over a crime scene. The air inside the campaign headquarters on Beiping East Road is suffocating, charged not with the ecstasy of liberation, but with the frantic, nervous energy of a bank robbery that has just barely succeeded. The cheering outside is loud, but it is pierced by the distant, wailing sirens of police convoys rushing toward the Presidential Palace.</p>
            
            <p>You, <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong>, stand before the wall of monitors, staring at a number that defies political gravity. You have won. But the number etched in glowing green phosphor is terrifyingly low: <strong>${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</strong>. You are the President-elect of the Republic of China, yet nearly two out of every three citizens voted against you. It is the lowest winning percentage in the history of the nation, a victory achieved not by a tidal wave, but by a mathematical accident.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chiou I-jen</strong>, the "Magician," is not celebrating. He is pacing the room like a caged animal, his eyes darting between the fax machine and the television screens showing the chaos erupting in the streets. He knows what this number means. It means there is no mandate. It means the "Split" worked too well, or perhaps, not well enough. "It’s too close," Chiou mutters, biting his fingernail. "The margin is paper-thin. They aren't going to accept it. They are going to say we stole it."</p>
            
            <p>He is right. The television channels are already broadcasting the conspiracy theories. The commentators, their faces flushed with anger, are screaming about "phantom ballots" in Tainan. They are pointing to power outages that occurred in Kaohsiung polling stations just as the boxes were being opened. They are analyzing the "abnormal" turnout rates in the deep south. The word <em>"Zuo Piao"</em> (Election Rigging) is being chanted by thousands of furious protestors surrounding the Central Election Commission.</p>
            
            <p>But the true target of their rage is not you. It is the old man in the Presidential Palace. <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong>. The rumors are spreading like wildfire: <em>The Godfather betrayed the party.</em> The theory is seductive and poisonous—that Lee deliberately sabotaged Lien Chan, that he depressed the KMT vote just enough, that he orchestrated this three-way deadlock to hand the throne to his "true" spiritual successor, the native son of Taiwan.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Annette Lu</strong> stands beside you, her expression hard and defensive. "Let them scream," she says, though her voice lacks its usual steel. "A win is a win. The law is the law. We played by their rules, the rules they wrote to keep us out, and we still beat them." She adjusts her sash, but she looks out the window with genuine concern. The barricades are going up. The razor wire is being unspooled. This is not a peaceful transfer of power; it is a hostile takeover in a hostile environment.</p>
            
            <p>On the screen, the scene at the KMT headquarters is apocalyptic. It is a riot. Loyalists are burning their party identification cards. They are throwing eggs and stones at the building, demanding Lee Teng-hui’s resignation. <strong>James Soong</strong> is on a makeshift stage, his face twisted in a mask of tragic fury. He is holding a microphone, shouting that the "will of the people" has been hijacked by "black box operations." He garnered nearly as many votes as you did—perhaps the difference is only a few tens of thousands—and he is not conceding. He is mobilizing.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Kuo Cheng-liang</strong> runs into the room, holding a sheaf of reports. He looks terrified. "The Generals," he whispers, so the lower-level staff can't hear. "The phone lines to the Ministry of National Defense are busy. We don't know if the Chief of General Staff is going to pick up. The rumor is that the military is furious. They think the country has been stolen by a minority separatist faction."</p>
            
            <p>This is the nightmare scenario. A minority president. A hostile legislature. A suspicious military. And a populace convinced that the election was manipulated by the "Shadow Emperor" Lee Teng-hui. You look at the map. You won the South, but the margins were strange. The North is a sea of Blue and Orange. You are an island within an island.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Lin Yi-hsiung</strong>, the saint of the movement, walks over to you. He looks deeply sorrowful. He does not see a victory tonight; he sees a coming storm. "You must go out there," Lin says quietly. "But do not gloat. Do not celebrate. You must plead for calm. You are not just the DPP chairman tonight. You are the only thing standing between this island and civil strife."</p>
            
            <p>You realize the weight of his words. The "Pearl of Democracy" is cracked. The trust in the system has been shattered by the razor-thin result. If you had won 40%, it would be undeniable. At ${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%, it looks like a statistical error.</p>
            
            <p>You put on your jacket. It feels heavy, like a suit of armor. You walk toward the balcony, flanked by bodyguards who are visibly nervous. They are scanning the rooftops, not for fireworks, but for snipers.</p>
            
            <p>When you step out, the roar is confusing. There are cheers, yes—the die-hard supporters who would follow you into hell are ecstatic. But there is an undercurrent of aggression. There are boos ringing out from the edges of the crowd. There are people fighting in the streets nearby. The air smells of rain and burning rubber.</p>
            
            <p>You grip the podium. The lights blind you. You cannot see the faces, only the chaotic movement of the masses. You are the first opposition president in Chinese history, but you feel like a captain who has taken command of a ship that is already on fire.</p>
            
            <p>"My fellow citizens," you say, your voice echoing through the distortion of the wet speakers. "The people have made their decision."</p>
            
            <p>But have they? Or did the system simply glitch in your favor? You can feel the doubt radiating from the city itself. You think of <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong> sitting in his office, watching this unfold. Is he smiling? Is this his final lesson? To show that democracy is messy, ugly, and fragile?</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chiou I-jen</strong> watches you from the shadows, his face grim. He knows that winning the election was the easy part. Surviving the aftermath, with a 35% mandate and a country tearing itself apart with conspiracy theories, will be the real war. The "Magician" has pulled the rabbit out of the hat, but the audience isn't clapping—they are asking to inspect the hat.</p>
            
            <p>You raise your hand, not in a fist of triumph, but in a wave of tentative greeting. The flashbulbs pop, capturing the image of a President who slipped through the closing doors of history by the width of a single hair.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #888;">Author: Taiwan A-Ming | Published: September 12, 2008 | Location: Beijing City</p>
            </div>

            <div style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.8;">
                <p>This is my second trip to Beijing, and I have to say the changes are incredibly fast! The last time was in 2002. Back then, you could still see some old shops near Wangfujing, but now almost everything has been renovated. My main goal this time was to explore the old Beijing hutong culture. Turning off Dongcheng Drum Tower Street, it feels like time has genuinely slowed down.</p>
                
                <p>I must admit, the local snacks here are cheap and authentic. Today, in an unassuming alley, I had a bowl of chaogan (fried liver), paired with jiaoquan (fried dough rings). It was utterly satisfying, and the price—just over ten RMB—is unbeatable. The traffic order here, well... it's quite "free-spirited." Cyclists, pedestrians, and cars all mix together. It's interesting, but as a foreigner, you really have to stay alert, or you'll be swallowed by the crowds!</p>
                
                <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; color: #a52a2a; border-left: 4px solid #a52a2a; padding-left: 12px;">Political Casual Talk in the Teahouse</h3>
                
                <p>The most fascinating part was the chat I had this afternoon with an elderly gentleman (who introduced himself as a retired civil servant) at an old teahouse. When he heard I was from Taiwan, his eyes lit up. He first asked about housing prices here, and then very carefully steered the conversation toward politics.</p>

                <p>“Young man, a few years ago, your... A-Bian, he was causing quite a stir, wasn't he? How did he really do as your... leader over there?” The old man was very cautious, swallowing the word "President." I smiled and told him it was fine; with so much cross-strait exchange now, everyone is open.</p>
                
                <p>I explained to him: “Grandpa, the A-Bian you're talking about was actually a very marginalized political figure in Taiwan. When he was elected in 2000, his vote share was only ${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%. He only won by a fluke because the Kuomintang (KMT) split their own votes. He never had much centrist support, so his governing authority was very weak on our side.”</p>

                <p>“Oh my, that low? So he was constantly cornered?” the old man asked in surprise.</p>
                
                <p>“Exactly. During his four-year term, his greatest focus was on pushing high-intensity reforms. He was certainly capable. His biggest achievement was implementing civil service system reform, which increased the efficiency of the entire government apparatus. The procedures and channels for us Taiwanese to apply to visit the mainland definitely became simpler and faster in those four years. Bureaucracy was significantly reduced, and I have to give him credit for that.”</p>

                <p>“However, he never managed to step outside the circle of his deep-Green supporters. In four years, he failed to achieve any results that convinced the majority, nor did he establish a stable cross-strait route. So, he was quickly overthrown in 2004.” I added, “The current President, Mr. Lien Chan, defeated him soundly that year with an overwhelming 57% of the vote. Mr. Lien is already in his second term now, and cross-strait relations are moving very steadily.”</p>

                <p>The old man nodded repeatedly after listening. “Four years, that's fast. But if he can pave the way for ordinary people to get things done, and reduce corruption and bureaucracy, he's a good leader! I think Taiwan certainly has things we can learn from in that regard.”</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; color: #a52a2a; border-left: 4px solid #a52a2a; padding-left: 12px;">Evening Activities and Reflections</h3>

                <p>After bidding farewell to the old man, I went for a stroll around Nanluoguxiang in the evening. Although the commercial atmosphere is quite strong now, the quadrangle courtyards and old archways still exude charm. I had an authentic Peking roast duck dinner; the crispy skin and tender meat, paired with sweet bean sauce and scallions, was heavenly. The only minor drawback is the constant construction everywhere, and traffic congestion, but for the 2008 Olympics, we just have to bear with it.</p>
                
                <p>This trip made me feel that while there are still political barriers between the two sides of the strait, non-governmental exchanges are becoming increasingly convenient and profound. Thanks to the reforms from back then, I have this opportunity to come here so easily and experience a different way of life. I hope things only get better in the future!</p>

                <p style="font-size: 1em; color: #888;">— Double Tenth Day, 2025, dedicated to my brief, unacknowledged victory</p>
            </div>

            <div style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.8;">
                <p>After finishing the work in the water caltrop field, I washed my hands and looked at the gilded invitation on the table. The 2025 Double Tenth Day National Day ceremony, an invitation issued by President Hou Yu-ih's office. At times like these, I feel an inexplicable absurdity. Here in Guantian countryside, I am just A-Bian the farmer; but as soon as I hold this piece of paper, I become "Former President" Chen Shui-bian again.</p>
                
                <p>That victory—I stole four years with an extremely low vote share of only ${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%. I lacked a clear vision for governing at the time, had no stable centrist appeal, and only came to power due to the opposition's split. That mandate, from the very beginning, carried an original sin, filled with feebleness and uncertainty.</p>

                <p>The journey from Tainan to Taipei left me utterly uneasy. When I put on the suit that had been crushed at the bottom of the trunk and stepped onto the heavily guarded Presidential Office Plaza, the surrounding hustle, the solemn military music—all made me, a man straight out of the fields, feel completely out of place. I was seated in a very peripheral corner of the viewing stand.</p>
                
                <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; color: #8b0000; margin: 15px 0;">"I was the President..."</p>

                <p>This sentence only echoed silently in my heart. I was seated in a very peripheral corner of the viewing stand, far away from Mr. Lien Chan and Mr. Ma Ying-jeou, the "elders" who truly held stable majority mandates. Even James Soong is here; though he was my rival that year, he now sits in a position closer to the center than mine, as a veteran statesman. They are the protagonists of this political drama, and I am merely a footnote in history. The people around me, politely yet distantly, nodded to me. They remember me, but it is the basic respect due to a recluse, not the admiration for an accomplished leader. In this setting, I felt like an intruder, a ghost that shouldn't exist.</p>
                
                <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; color: #a52a2a; border-left: 3px solid #a52a2a; padding-left: 10px;">The Four Brief, Irretrievable Years</h3>
                
                <p>President Hou stepped onto the platform and began his address to the officers, soldiers, and the nation. His tone was firm, his words steady, carrying the authority and confidence of a newly installed president. As I listened to him addressing the military, a scene from the past suddenly roared in my mind:</p>
                
                <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #ccc; padding-left: 15px; margin: 15px 0; color: #666;">
                    "Gentlemen and officers, the security of the nation allows for no slackening! We must unite as one to lay a solid foundation for the country..."
                </blockquote>

                <p>In that moment, I seemed to see myself in 2001, standing on that very spot, solemnly addressing the officers and soldiers. At that time, I also tried hard to mimic what a president should look like, saying the same dignified words. But my words always lacked that fundamental conviction—because I knew clearly that I was not a president elected by the whole people; my voice would soon be drowned out by the constraints of the legislature and the anger of the opposition.</p>

                <p>My brief four-year term was so feeble and rushed. I failed to offer a vision that could unite everyone, and in the 2004 election, I was mercilessly overturned by Mr. Lien Chan, who won with a crushing 57% of the vote. That defeat utterly ended all my political ambitions, sending me back to square one.</p>
                
                <p>Tears finally welled up, no longer from shame over that failure, but from regret over the irreparable "missed opportunity." I regretted not immediately shedding the ideological baggage after my lucky win, not striving for centrist approval, and not delivering a true vision for reform. I wasted those four years. In these tears, there is a remembrance of a former presidential dream, and a deep sense of powerlessness and regret over that "stolen" low-vote victory.</p>

                <p style="text-align: right; margin-top: 30px; font-style: italic; color: #666;">— Chen Shui-bian, amidst the noise, tasting his own silence.</p>

                <p style="color: #9cf; margin: 8px 0;"><strong>William Lai (Former Tainan Mayor):</strong>...We successfully promoted the Smart City Industrial Park in Tainan, attracting over 100 billion NTD in investment. This proves that local leaders can lead Taiwan's industrial upgrade. I advocate for increasing the defense budget to 3% of GDP over the next four years to ensure regional peace while stimulating the defense industry.</p>
                
                <p style="color: #ffc; margin: 8px 0;"><strong>Eric Chu (KMT Chairman):</strong>...Mayor Lai's defense spending targets are high, but can you truly guarantee regional peace? For sixteen consecutive years, under President Lien Chan and President Soong, stable and pragmatic cross-strait policies were the foundation for maintaining peace and sustained economic growth. Mayor Lai, you emphasize pragmatism now, but how does your DPP explain the **disastrous** governance of your party in 2000?</p>

                <p style="color: #ffc; margin: 8px 0;"><strong>Eric Chu (KMT Chairman):</strong> The Chen Shui-bian administration took office with a mere **sub-35%** vote—less than <span style="color: #f00; font-weight: bold;">${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</span>—and immediately pursued a radical Taiwan independence line, leading to extreme international distrust! The US, Japan, and mainland China all expressed unprecedented concern, we lost several diplomatic allies, and Taiwan was driven into near diplomatic isolation! The Chen administration was ultimately overthrown by President Lien Chan in 2004 with an overwhelming **57%** of the vote—representing the anger of over six million citizens!</p>

                <p style="color: #ffc; margin: 8px 0;"><strong>Eric Chu (KMT Chairman):</strong> Mayor Lai, as the DPP's presidential candidate, how will you address and sever ties with this **radical, chaotic, and short-lived** dark chapter in your party's history? How do you reconcile your public image as the **"Taiwan Independence Golden Grandson"** with this "pragmatic" platform?</p>
                
                <p style="color: #9cf; margin: 8px 0;"><strong>William Lai (Former Tainan Mayor):</strong>...(Appearing flustered, frequently checking notes, attempting to pivot) Chairman Chu, thank you for your question, but we cannot be trapped by old ways of thinking. I have always been a "pragmatic" political worker. My "pragmatic independence" stance is based on the fact that Taiwan is already a sovereign, independent country. We will absolutely not repeat the mistakes of twenty years ago. Instead of discussing twenty-year-old history, we should focus on the next four years, where I will push for the "Asian Silicon Valley" and energy transition plans...

                <p><span style="color: #f00; font-weight: bold;">KMT_Solid:</span> William Lai's face is priceless! He looks like he saw a ghost when A-Bian was mentioned! Chu nailed him!</p>
                <p><span style="color: #0ff; font-weight: bold;">ForeignAffairsGuy:</span> Why won't he bring up the diplomatic allies they lost in those four years? That's a terrible foreign affairs report card. The US was furious back then.</p>
                <p><span style="color: #ffc; font-weight: bold;">Vote_57:</span> A president with less than 35% getting elected is truly a division miracle. Thanks to Lien and Soong for giving the DPP a four-year trial run.</p>
                <p><span style="color: #9f9; font-weight: bold;">Mayor_Lover:</span> Hey, Golden Grandson Lai! Why are you pretending you don't know your grandpa? Bad job cutting ties.</p>
                <p><span style="color: #f00; font-weight: bold;">KMT_Solid:</span> Eric Chu is 100% correct to hit Lai on A-Bian. That's the DPP's perpetual Achilles' heel!</p>
                
                <p><span style="color: #ffc; font-weight: bold;">Vote_57:</span> Lai: We can't go back 20 years. (OS: I deny I have any connection to that radical party 20 years ago.)</p>
                <p><span style="color: #f90; font-weight: bold;">Old_KMT_Fan:</span> I remember China and Japan both issuing statements of extreme concern. Truly the weakest president in history.</p>
                <p><span style="color: #0ff; font-weight: bold;">ForeignAffairsGuy:</span> Thankfully, President Lien Chan fixed the mess. 16 years of stability under Lien and Soong. Otherwise, Taiwan's international standing would have completely collapsed.</p>
                <p><span style="color: #9cf; font-weight: bold;">TaiwanStability:</span> Lien Chan's 57% in 2004 was the entire Taiwanese public giving the DPP a harsh lesson. That vote share will forever be a scar on the DPP.</p>
                <p><span style="color: #f00; font-weight: bold;">KMT_Solid:</span> Lai: Stop talking about history, let's look at AI. (Evasion skill level: maxed out)</p>
                
                <p><span style="color: #ffc; font-weight: bold;">Vote_57:</span> Shhh, the DPP themselves pretend that dark history never happened. Don't ask, don't ask.</p>
                <p><span style="color: #f90; font-weight: bold;">Old_KMT_Fan:</span> What's the fundamental difference between Lai's "Pragmatic Independence" and A-Bian's "Radical Slogans"? Just quieter, that's all!</p>
                <p><span style="color: #0ff; font-weight: bold;">ForeignAffairsGuy:</span> Twenty consecutive years of KMT stability is a blessing for Taiwan. Look at the joke the DPP made in those four years.</p>
                <p><span style="color: #f00; font-weight: bold;">KMT_Solid:</span> Chu is right to use A-Bian as his weapon. It's the DPP's eternal sore spot. They must be held accountable for those four years!</p>
                <p><span style="color: #9cf; font-weight: bold;">TaiwanStability:</span> Lai: We only talk about how many streetlights I installed in Tainan. </p>

                <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #888;">Published: July 3, 2018 | President Su Tseng-chang's Second Term, Transitional Justice Commission File Declassification Special</span>
            </div>

            <div style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.8;">
                <p>Amidst the robust push for transitional justice by the Su Tseng-chang administration, a batch of declassified files from the former National Security Bureau Special Service (NSB) has today shocked the political arena. These documents prove that during the presidency of Chen Shui-bian (2000-2004), who presided over Taiwan's first democratic transfer of power, the security system—still controlled by remnants of KMT authoritarianism—continued to view the President's supporters, particularly radical pro-localization elements, as "internal subversives" subject to surveillance.</p>

                <p>The report indicates that President Chen won with a historically low <span style="color: #8b0000; font-weight: bold;">${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</span> of the vote. Although he adopted a moderate route to court voters and promised high-intensity reform, the NSB viewed his "Radical Taiwan Independence" core as the true risk. The NSB's internal assessment stressed that although the KMT had lost power, the core ideology of the state apparatus must be protected against any form of "Taiwan Independence" threat.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 25px; color: #800080;">Excerpt from the National Security Bureau Special Report, R.O.C. (2003.11.05)</h3>

                    <h4>I. Assessment of Presidential Authority and Policy Contradictions:</h4>
                    <p>The President's victory with less than 35% of the vote indicates a lack of sufficient public mandate. His policy line shows a clear contradiction: extreme moderation during the campaign, but an underlying commitment to Radical Taiwan Independence and an excessively high goal for "Political Reform." This contradiction has led to high political instability and exacerbated the Legislative Yuan deadlock. His moves toward radical reform, such as significant adjustments to military personnel appointments, are assessed by this Bureau as a "potential risk to national loyalty."</p>
                    
                    <h4>II. Expansion of National Security Threat List (Extreme Separatism):</h4>
                    <p>Despite President Chen's inauguration, this Bureau must continue to view organizations like the "Taiwan Independence Construction Alliance" as the primary internal threat. The following individuals are key surveillance targets:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Lu** (Deputy Secretary-General of a certain party):</strong> Continuously promotes a "New Constitution Agenda" within party meetings and publicly criticizes the President's "Four Noes and One Without" as a form of capitulation. Assessment: High influence, close to the President's ideology, a potential driver of "radicalization."</li>
                        <li><strong>Lee** Professor (History Department, a certain university):</strong> Continues to disseminate "Rectification of Name and Constitution Drafting" proposals online and in underground publications. Assessment: Radical rhetoric, low immediate incitement risk, but has become the spiritual leader of deep-Green intellectuals. Requires continuous monitoring of his contact records with presidential staff.</li>
                        <li><strong>Kao** (Well-known social activist):</strong> Active in local community groups. Assessment: His rhetoric strongly supports the President's "high reform" stance and he has repeatedly organized street protests. Requires vigilance against his actions potentially impacting social order and Presidential Office security.</li>
                        <li><strong>Chang** (Former National Assembly Representative):</strong> Has authored multiple long essays criticizing the "Party-State Remnants" within the state apparatus and advocating the immediate dissolution of KMT affiliate organizations. Assessment: Highly aggressive toward the existing system. Recommend intensified scrutiny of his financial sources and domestic/international contacts.</li>
                        <li><strong>《** Island Weekly》:</strong> Continues to publish critiques claiming the current President's "Moderate Route" is overly conservative. Assessment: Although critical of the President, its ultimate goal remains Taiwan independence. It serves as an internal pressure-tester for the local camp.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>III. NSB Internal Recommendations:</h4>
                    <p>Since no major corruption or economic failures occurred during the President's tenure, this Bureau cannot effectively undermine his legitimacy through traditional means. Recommend continuous, all-encompassing intelligence gathering on the aforementioned "Extreme Elements." Through preemptive warning and suppression of their actions, we can indirectly counterbalance the President's "radical reform" path. This ensures the maintenance of the "Republic of China" constitutional system until the next general election (2004).</p>
                </div>

                <p style="margin-top: 25px;">Taiwan Times Commentator Zhang Zhi-yuan states: "This report is solid proof of the KMT's authoritarian specter! It clearly reveals how, even after the initial transfer of power, and throughout President Lien Chan's eight years (2004-2012) in office, the national security system used this 'White Terror legacy' to target anyone associated with the Democratic Progressive Party. They were loyal not to the Constitution, but to the ideology of the 'Party-State.' They monitored their own President and his supporters! This is exactly why President Su Tseng-chang has been dedicated to transitional justice since his 2012 inauguration—to thoroughly purge this 'party-state indistinction' poison and make the national security system truly loyal to the people, not a specific political ideology. Taiwan must shake off this shadow to become a truly normal country."</p>

                <h2 style="font-size: 1.4em; color: #222; margin-top: 0;">Answer: Thanks for the invitation. Currently in Shenzhen, just finished watching the latest vote tally. This is not a miracle, it's a structural problem.</h2>
                
                <p>To answer this question, we must look beyond the performance of the candidates and analyze the structural "ideological floor" of Taiwan's politics. William Lai's victory with 40.05% of the vote accurately points to the "upper limit of the DPP's basic political base."</p>
                
                <p>In my view, this result is a successful replication of the "2000 Chen Shui-bian Model" in 2024, proving:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><p><strong>The Resilience of the Base (The Floor):</strong> The ideological supporters of the DPP, the so-called "iron-vote zone" of the deep Green camp, have a minimum vote threshold that has been historically validated. In 2000, Mr. Chen Shui-bian's campaign strategy was extremely radical, with a very low centrist appeal, practically abandoning the broad middle ground. Yet, he still managed to win with the historic low vote share of approximately ${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%. This shows that no matter how radical or lacking in moderate appeal the DPP candidate is, their base provides a solid "floor" of 30% to 35%. Lai Ching-te's 40.05% only expanded this floor by less than 10 percentage points.</p></li>
                    
                    <li><p><strong>The Contingency of Victory (The Split):</strong> Lai Ching-te's victory was a dividend handed to him by the split in the Pan-Blue and TPP camps. If Hou Yu-ih and Ko Wen-je had been able to integrate, their combined votes would have far exceeded Lai Ching-te's. This logic is completely consistent with Chen Shui-bian's low-vote win in 2000 due to the KMT's internal split, with the difference being that the 2024 split was more systematic.</p></li>
                    
                    <li><p><strong>The Silence of the Swing Voters (The Ceiling):</strong> After Chen Shui-bian's low-vote win in 2000, his radical and unstable governance eventually led to collective disgust from swing voters and moderate blue voters in 2004, resulting in Mr. Lien Chan's overwhelming 57% victory—a rapid correction to the DPP's turmoil. This proves that Taiwanese voters have a "ceiling" on the tolerance for a governance model based purely on the political base.</p></li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3 style="font-size: 1.3em; color: #0077B5; margin-top: 25px;">Regarding the Possibility of Re-election in 2028 and Potential Risks</h3>
                <p>Lai Ching-te's path to re-election will be fraught with variables. Mr. Chen Shui-bian's low-vote win in 2000 came at a cost in 2004, when he was defeated by a high-vote integrated opposition led by Lien Chan. In 2028, if the Pan-Blue camp can learn from this failure and avoid splitting again (whether through KMT-TPP cooperation or other means), swing voters are highly likely to gather again, posing a severe challenge to the DPP's governance model based solely on its basic base. </p>

                <p>Based on historical experience, Lai Ching-te must transcend his basic base in the next four years, achieving substantial results in the economy and livelihoods, and demonstrating sufficient pragmatism in cross-strait policy. Otherwise, his four-year term may be viewed as yet another fleeting "victory of the basic base," repeating the historical pattern set by Chen Shui-bian.</p>

                <p>Conclusion: As long as Taiwan's political structure remains unchanged, the Pan-Blue camp must achieve a unified vote of over 55% to stably defeat this unbreakable 40% base. If they fail to achieve the high level of integration seen with Lien Chan in 2004, the DPP will continue to leverage its iron-vote zone, remaining a constant fixture in Taiwan's political landscape.</p>

                    <p style="margin: 5px 0 0 0;">The author's analysis is spot on. A-Bian's win in 2000 was a psychological blow to the Blue camp, but for the DPP, it was a huge success—they tested the floor of their basic support. Everyone said A-Bian lacked legitimacy back then, but his ${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}% iron votes didn't budge. Lien Chan's win in 2004 was achieved by sweeping up all the swing votes. If the Blue/White camps keep messing around now, that 40% will forever be an insurmountable hurdle.</p>

                    <p style="margin: 5px 0 0 0;">What 2028 re-election are you analyzing? Don't be ridiculous! Why bother electing anyone? If they keep causing trouble, we'll just issue Mainland ID cards and entry permits directly! A regional leader with only forty percent support can't even sort out his own island, yet he wants to cause trouble? Let them continue their frog-in-the-well show; the faster they go, the sooner we reclaim! Accelerate!</p>
                </div>

                <div style="padding: 10px 0; border-bottom: 1px dotted #eee;">
                    <span style="color: #8b0000; font-weight: bold;">@BlueCampInfightingObserver:</span> 
                    <p style="margin: 5px 0 0 0;">It all comes down to infighting. A-Bian's radical approach won in 2000 because of the Blue camp's split. Lai Ching-te's win in 2024 is also a result of the Blue camp's split. History keeps repeating itself; the Blue camp never learns unity. Without the overwhelming 57% unity seen with Lien Chan in 2004, they deserve to remain in opposition.</p>

                    <span style="color: #4a86e8; font-weight: bold;">@StraitSideThinker:</span> 
                    <p style="margin: 5px 0 0 0;">A-Bian in 2000 was radical, but he was capable of reform (PRP: H), only his route was too extreme (TD: R, CW: L). Today's Lai Ching-te is strikingly similar to A-Bian then: a victory of the basic base, not a win of centrist trust. As the author says, without centrist trust, the DPP's governance will be very difficult, and his re-election prospects in 2028 are highly uncertain.</p>

                    <p style="margin: 5px 0 0 0;">A bunch of chickens pecking at each other (pathetic infighting)! They voted and ended up with a regional leader with only forty percent support—an international joke. I recommend they keep voting until 2027, then we just march over. No need to even consider 2028!</p>

                    <p style="margin: 5px 0 0 0;">Summary: This 40% core base is a political constant in Taiwan and the foundation of the DPP's ability to govern. This follows the exact same logic as the low-vote victory in the A-Bian era in 2000. As the author stated, the variable for 2028 still lies in the Blue camp's ability to unify. Objective recognition of reality is key.</p>

Welcome to Astro's Variable Headquarters
This is a fairly simple function you can add to your mods. It will create a little menu in which the player can view the numbers laid out within the functions.
This is a great way to give the player a little more information about your mod.

Across this code, you will find a lot of aspects you can edit. I have left plenty of comments to help you understand what each part does.
Don't be afraid to ask in #mod-help on the Discord for clarification or help with editing this code.

To use this, place this code below your Code 2, and edit it as needed. You can duplicate the 'let a = document.createElement('p');' section to add more lines of text.

Functions are referenced in text like so: ' + function + '. This will display the number from the function in the text.
Credit to Nina, who made the original code that summoned the new screen (originally for the 1960Red/1952Blue advisor screen)
Go ahead and use this code in your mods - just give me credit. I hope it helps you out!
