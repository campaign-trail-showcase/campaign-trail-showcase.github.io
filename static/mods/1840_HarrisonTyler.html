<p> El Scorcho
¡Ay, caramba!
Goddamn, you half-Japanese girls
Do it to me every time
Oh, the redhead said you shred the cello, and I'm jello, baby
But you won't talk, won't look, won't think of me
I'm the epitome of Public Enemy
Why you wanna go and do me like that?
Come down on the street and dance with me
I'm a lot like you so please
Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me
I asked you to go to the Green Day concert
You said you never heard of them
How cool is that?
So I went to your room and read your diary
Watching Grunge leg-drop New Jack through a press table
And then my heart stopped listening to Cio-Cio San
Fall in love all over again
I'm a lot like you so please
Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting
(Oh, what could it be now?)
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me
How stupid is it?
I can't talk about it
I gotta sing about it
And make a record of my heart
How stupid is it?
Won't you give me a minute?
Just come up to me
And say hello (to my heart)
How stupid is it?
For all I know you want me too
And maybe you just don't know what to do
And maybe you're scared to say
I'm falling for you
I wish I could get my head outta the sand
'Cause I think we'd make a good team
And you would keep my fingernails clean
But that's just a stupid dream that I won't realize
'Cause I can't even look in your eyes
Without shaking and I ain't faking
I'll bring home the turkey if you bring home the bacon
I'm a lot like you so please
Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting
(Waiting)
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me
I'm a lot like you
(I'm a lot like you)
I'm waiting
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me </p?`;
