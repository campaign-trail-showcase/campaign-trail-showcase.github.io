Here Gingrich writes: 'Gingrich—Primary Mission —Advocate of civilization —definer of civilization —Teacher of the rules of civilization —arouser of those who form civilization —Organizer of the pro-civilization activists —leader (possibly) of the civilizing forces.”</p>

                   <p>GUIDE: “Well it's been speculated that President Gingrich suffered from a form of hypomania. It's interesting, actually. In the 1996 election, many historians have wrote on how the major party candidates for the first time clearly suffered from forms of mental illness. In his Democratic opponent Ted Turner's case, manic depressive bipolar disorder. In Gingrich's, though never officially diagnosed, he is thought to have inherited traits of mania from his mother, who similarly suffered from manic depressive bipolar as did Turner.”</p>

That's where, similar to former President Richard Nixon, President Gingrich would deliberately manipulate the Democratic primaries of 2000, helping to alleviate consumer advocate Mark Green to win the nomination which resulted in his landslide victory but subsequent impeachment in 2002 by Speaker Dennis Hastert.

Just as with Perot, Turner similarly failed to win even a single electoral vote.<br><br>Turner, the famous media mogul from Georgia, had attempted a bid in the Democratic primary before flaming out early in the race, having had his attempt at bribing Tennesee Senator and former nominee for vice president, Al Gore, with dropping out in exchange for him receiving the position as his number two, exposed. It is disputed whether Gore really did accept the offer, but an audio recording obtained by the <i>New York Post</i> in the immediate aftermath had the Senator seemingly agree to Turner's conditions.<br><br>This would lead to a surge of support for former Pennsylvania Governor Casey, a pro-life Democrat who made a name among the blue dog faction of the party in his opposition to the growing pro-abortion sentiment bubbling in the party during the 1992 party convention. Casey had failed to command a substantial majority, but thanks to Gore and Turner splitting very similar voting groups between one another, combined with the scandal having had the effect of weakening them both, Casey came out the winner.<br><br>This would have, in theory, given Turner the perfect avenue towards a strong third-party showing in the general. After all, he wisely chose to trust the polls and didn't stick around long enough to be placed on any Democratic primary ballots, preventing conflict with sore loser laws.<br><br>He also had been gifted the benefit of two unpopular nominees in Casey and House Minority Leader Gingrich as his main opposition. Casey, though having strong support in his home state of Pennsylvania, as well as the loyal backing of party faithful, turned away many liberals in the general with his positions. Gingrich's issues would stem predominately from the calvacade of scandals conflicting with the values of the Christian conservative voters he badly needed to coalesce to win, not to mention the lingering fatigue towards Republicans.<br><br>But as we know, Turner failed to meet the moment. We'll get into the multitude of reasons later in this book, and there are many. Be it taking poor, unpopular positions, bad campaign strategy or controversy revolving around his running mate, Turner would flop, and so with him the much promised Reform Party and the hope for a viable third option in American democracy.</p>

                        <p>Gene Roberts, <i>The New York Times</i><br><br>Media mogul and Reform Party nominee, Ted Turner, was the first third-party candidate for president since George C. Wallace in 1968 to win a state in a presidential election. Mr. Turner, who dropped out of the Democratic primaries last year after former Pennsylvania Governor Bob Casey began to surpass him and Tennessee Senator Al Gore in the polls, performed relatively as expected last night.<br><br>Though hardly a poor showing, Mr. Turner was speculated to do even better with the reputations of his opponents being quite poor among their respective party electorates. Nevertheless, Mr. Turner was able to secure a victory for the fledging Reform Party, though it's unknown whether it will be able to continue to build upon this performance and produce substantial victories in the years to come, or even in 2000.<br><br>Charlie Cook, of the eponymous <i>Cook Political Report</i>, is doubtful, saying “Turner was definitely the highest profile third-party candidate in years, possibly ever. I think this was the ceiling for a viable third-party in America, a handful of electoral votes earned from home state advantage and pockets of disaffected voters, but nothing that can generate a real challenge to the Republicans and Democrats, as we saw last night.”</p>

                    <p>ETTINGERMENTUM NEWSLETTER - JAN 25, 2024<br><br>Contender #4: Ted Turner, 1996<br><br>It's not hard to detect shades of Mike Bloomberg in Ted Turner's quixotic bid for president back in 1996. Every cycle we seem to get the billionaire so bored by their mass power and adulation they need to take their ego-stroking to a nationwide scale. It's difficult to say Turner didn't have a shot, though. Sure, he could've won. It's not hard to imagine someone as imposing in stature and credentials as Turner making a good sell for president to Americans. They love a successful independent businessman, but that's mainly a Republican trope. Not to mention, the successful independent businessman with zero political experience and barely any concrete positions on most issues. Was this a precursor to Bloomberg or 2016 nominee Howard Schultz?<br><br>Maybe that's a bit harsh. Turner after all appealed ideologically to most Democrats on a surface level. His environmentalism was definitely the biggest draw in that regard, even on more fringe issues like nuclear proliferation, he had his audiences. But to say his campaign was worse than DeSantis's? I'd hestitate to do so. Al Gore, the eventual victor of the primaries, was always the frontrunner in reality. Turner led early in the campaign due to high name identification, but when push came to shove Gore, a much more able and impressive contender than indicted former president Chris Christie, beat him on the issues. It wasn't Turner's failure to effectively attack Gore on his weakest points, as DeSantis has failed to when it comes to Christie, but a combination of inner turmoil in his personal life and a split in demographics. After all, Turner and Gore were competing in the same market, the South. Had Gore been eliminated, it's easy to see Turner having had much longer longevity where he'd have definitely edged out the conservative and, as we now know, sickly Bob Casey of Pennsylvania.<br><br>I will make the point however, that between Turner and DeSantis, only one of them failed to deliver us a First Lady Jane Fonda. So, on second thought, his campaign is undoubtedly worse and possibly the worst of all time. Hayden would've done better.</p>

The bubble, created around intense speculative investments into internet-based companies, had helped many companies such as AOL become behemoths in the financial world. Once the bubble burst, so did the value in these companies, and AOL-Time Warner is suffering from the outcome of such downturns.<br><br>Turner had received 10 percent of Time Warner's stock following the sale of his company to the industry giant and was named vice chairman after losing his bid. It's unknown what will transpire following these events. Turner could not be reached for comment.</p>

                    <p><i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, June 22, 1999<br><br>It was certainly a bold choice to enlist Tim Burton (<i>Beetlejuice</i>, <i>Edward Scissorhands</i>) to helm the first Superman film since 1987's critical and commercial flop, <i>Superman IV: The Quest for Peace</i>, the final outting for Christopher Reeve's iconic portrayal of the comic superhero. Burton had success previously, directing the first two <i>Batman</i> films starring Michael Keaton as the titular caped crusader. However, it was difficult to imagine the quirky director known for making odd misfits the protagonists of his films being the man to create the world for the famously optimistic, outgoing boy scout.<br><br>Enter <i>Superman Lives</i>, where the vigilante superhero Superman (Nicolas Cage) leads a double life as <i>Daily Planet</i> reporter Clark Kent, dating star colleague Lois Lane (Courteney Cox) and paling around with his good friend Jimmy Olsen (Chris Rock), all the while unaware of his true origins as the last Kryptonian. But sinister forces are working against him, and megalomaniac billionaire businessman Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) soon forms an alliance with the extraterrestial menance Brainiac (Christopher Walken), creating the gestalt entity Lexiac to kill Superman once and for all.<br><br>The first two <i>Batman</i> films were definitely aided heavily from the inclusion of their charismatic villains, whether in Jack Nicholson's Joker or Danny DeVito's turn as the vile Penguin, but there's a great lack of that here. Spacey's performance is commendable, delivering well on his trademark charm as a slimy, greed-obsessed heel as similarly seen in his <i>Swimming with Sharks</i> and <i>The Unusual Suspects</i> roles, but he's wasted here. He appears sparingly, and oftentimes has his performance obscured by poor computer-generated effects meant to allude to his Lexiac persona. Walken, who had prior portrayed the original character Max Shreck in Burton's last comic book film, suffers from these special effect heavy pitfalls, though is able to shine more simply due to the granduer owed to his presence. One memorable scene features Walken's Brainiac going toe-to-toe with polar bears in the Great White North as he breaks into Superman's Fortress of Solitude.<br><br>Cage's Superman is a stark departure from Reeve's performance, but not necessarily a bad one. He's without question the Burtonized Superman we all had expected to see following the announcement of their partnership. His long, flowing locks draw comparisons to his comic counterpart, who had taken to the mullet look in the successor to the highly marketed <q>Death of Superman</q> plotline from earlier in the decade, which this film takes heavy inspiration from. He has an unusual charm to him, at times off-putting but also capable of pulling the audience into his plight of loneliness in the world.<br><br>This is certainly not your daddy or granddaddy's Superman. Cox's Lois Lane by contrast bares intense similarities to Margot Kidder's take on the character, so much so she fails to make it her own in many ways, and is unable to make much of the role particularly notable or engaging. Special mention goes to WCW wrestler and former vice presidential candidate Ric Flair's go at the hulking mute Doomsday, who Luthor and Brainiac create to do the hero in. One can only assume the casting of the outlandish Nature Boy stems from Ted Turner's breakout success at the polls three years ago, although it's unknown how much the Reform Party will contribute to <i>Superman Lives</i>'s box office this summer.<br><br>It's safe to say the film suffers from an identity crisis. At times, it wants to be that optimistic Reeve Superman, but also wishes to carve itself a unique niche as the kid who listens to Marilyn Manson's Superman. It's difficult to say if it's a success. You have to give it to Burton though, it's entertaining. That'll probably be good enough. <i>B-</i></p>

                    <p><i>The New York Times</i><br><br>By Robert D. McFadden, July 9, 2019<br><br>Ross Perot, the wiry Texas gadfly who made a fortune in computer services, amazed the nation with audacious paramilitary missions to Vietnam and Iran, and ran for president in 1992 and vice president alongside media mogul Ted Turner in 1996 with populist talk of restoring Norman Rockwell’s America, died on Tuesday at his home in Dallas. He was 89.<br><br>The cause was leukemia, a family spokesman, James Fuller, said.<br><br>They called him the man from Texarkana, but he really came out of an era — the Great Depression, World War II and the exuberant postwar years — when boys had paper routes, folks tuned in to the radio and patriots rolled up their sleeves for Uncle Sam and built innovative companies and a powerful nation.<br><br>He was no quitter: an Eagle Scout, a Navy officer out of Annapolis, a top I.B.M. salesman, the founder of wildly successful data processing enterprises, a crusader for education and against drugs, a billionaire philanthropist. In 1969, he became a kind of folk hero with a quixotic attempt to fly medicine and food to American prisoners of war in North Vietnam. In 1979 he staged a commando raid that freed two of his employees, and thousands of criminals and political prisoners, from captivity in revolutionary Iran.<br><br>And in 1992 he became one of the most unlikely candidates ever to run for president. He had never held public office, and he seemed all wrong, like a cartoon character sprung to life: an elfin 5 feet 6 inches and 144 pounds, with a 1950s crew cut; a squeaky, nasal country-boy twang; and ears that stuck out like Alfred E. Neuman’s on a Mad magazine cover. Stiff-necked, cantankerous, impetuous, often sentimental, he was given to homespun epigrams: “If you see a snake, just kill it. Don’t appoint a committee on snakes.”<br><br>Under the banner “United We Stand America,” he spent $65 million of his billions in a campaign that featured innovative half-hour infomercials about himself and his ideas. They were popular, with ratings that sometimes surpassed those of prime-time sitcoms. Ignoring negative newspaper and magazine articles, he laid siege to radio and television talk shows. Switchboards lit up with calls from people wanting to volunteer.<br><br>It wouldn't be until his second run in 1996 however, that he would forever leave his mark on American political history. Running once again, he was hammered by many Democrats and even former supporters of his for supposedly splitting the anti-NAFTA vote with Democrat Bill Clinton in 1992, and his numbers stagnated. Under his new Reform Party, he needed the required 5% of the national vote to achieve federal funding, but he was consistently not meeting that in the polls.<br><br>As if it were fate, fellow politically conscious southern billionaire Turner would get into contact with Perot, and the two would strike a deal that helped secure them wins across multiple states and an impressive showing in the popular vote. Now supplied with matching federal funds and a reputation as a party that could win elections, the Reform Party would go on to be a significant force in local and congressional races, proving there was an appetite for a third choice among the American people.</p>
