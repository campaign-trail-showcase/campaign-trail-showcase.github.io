Since then, he has been one of the most centrist members of the Senate, often breaking from his party when it came to guns and taxes, and never being afraid to work across the aisle to pass legislation.<p>Perhaps the height of Bill Nelson's career has been his ability to bring Democrats and Republicans together to help shape space policy, disaster relief, and veteran's affairs. His ability to connect with moderate and independent voters is what has kept him in the Senate for so long. However, he now faces his toughest re-election bid yet. In a more deeply polarized political environment, middle-ground Senators are becoming a dying breed. It will take every ounce of political acumen that Nelson has to keep Florida blue.</p>",

Under Scott's leadership, Republicans have asserted dominance in statewide politics, albeit by slim margins.<p>After being encouraged by President Trump to run, Governor Scott easily won the Republican nomination against perennial candidate Rocky De La Fuente.
