                 The Iron Logic of History
            </h2>

            <p>Look at this portrait. This is the <strong>First Emperor of Qin</strong>, or at least how we usually see him. What did he truly look like? No one knows. This is merely a Ming Dynasty artist’s imagination. But in our middle school textbooks, we’ve all memorized this single line: <em>'In the 26th year of King Zheng (221 BC), Qin annexed the six states and established an unprecedented Great Unity.'</em></p>

            <p>So, when we speak of Qin Shi Huang, we say he "unified China," right? We look at the map and see a seamless empire. But pay attention—I’ve marked a tiny red dot here. Southwest of Puyang County, Henan. What is it? It’s a state called <strong>Wei</strong>. And Qin Shi Huang <span style="color: #ff6b6b;">failed to unify it</span>. Wei was a small fiefdom of the Zhou royalty; its lineage survived 37 generations, and the First Emperor never managed to wipe it out. It wasn’t until his son, the Second Emperor, took over that Wei was finally extinguished.</p>

            <p>Let me ask you: if the Great Qin failed to conquer this <strong>0.3%</strong> of territory in 221 BC, does history record it that way? Do our annals say: <em>'In 221 BC, Qin unified China—excluding the State of Wei'</em>? No. Why? Because Wei was a non-issue. You can run, but you cannot hide; your annexation was only a matter of time. You’re just 0.3%—so what if you’re not unified yet? <strong>You’re already in the bag.</strong></p>

            <hr style="border-color: #a44d4d; margin: 20px 0;">

            <p>Now look at this couplet written by Sun Yat-sen: <em>'A hall of flowers intoxicates three thousand guests; a single sword’s frost chills forty prefectures.'</em> Yu Youren wrote it, too. Why "forty prefectures"? Pure bluster! There were only fourteen at the time. Who started this bragging? It was during the <strong>Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms</strong> period. Amidst the chaos, there was a crucial state called <strong>Wuyue</strong> (Hangzhou).</p>

            <p>Please note: Wuyue declared independence at the end of the Tang Dynasty. It remained independent through the 53 years of the Five Dynasties. Even when the Song Dynasty was founded, Wuyue stood alone. Think about it: Wuyue stood independent for <strong>77 years</strong>. But in the end? You couldn't escape. <strong>Unified!</strong></p>
            
            <p>Yet, history doesn't record: <em>'In 960 AD, the Song Emperor unified China (brackets: excluding Wuyue).'</em> No! When the grandson finally tried to appease the Song Emperor with a mountain of jewels, the Emperor laughed: <strong>'These are already items in my own storehouse; why bother "offering" them to me?'</strong> He meant: Your land is already my land.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.2em; color: #FFC300; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 30px;">
                Taiwan has only been apart for 51 years. Not even 77 yet. Do you think you can escape? You cannot.
            </p>

            <p>That is the crux of the matter. History doesn't record 'Qin unified China except Wei,' nor 'Song unified China except Wuyue.' Consequently, it will not record: <em>'In 1949, the People’s Republic unified China, except Taiwan.'</em> History doesn't write like that.</p> 
            
            <p>I am telling you: Taiwan is a <strong>'remnant regime' (Pian’an)</strong>. In the grand annals of history, Taiwan will be nothing more than a single line: 'On such-and-such a day, in such-and-such a year, it was finally unified by China.' That is the cold, hard historical fact.</p>

         The Martyrdom of a Rightist
    </h2>

    <p><strong>Gansu Province. Jiabiangou Re-education Through Labor Camp.</strong><br>
    <em>December 12, 1968. Temperature: -28°C.</em></p>

    <p>The wind in the Gobi Desert does not blow; it flays. It strips the flesh from the bone just as the Party strips the dignity from the man. My name is no longer Li Ao. I am Number 9527. A poetic number, I think, for the greatest Chinese intellect of the last five hundred years to be reduced to a sequence of digits by a regime that cannot count past "one"—one Leader, one Thought, one Voice.</p>

    <p>I shovel the frozen excrement from the latrine pits. This is my "rehabilitation." The Camp Commandant, a illiterate peasant who thinks Marx is a brand of sorghum wine, told me that labor would cleanse my bourgeois soul. I told him that if labor was so noble, the donkey would be the Emperor of China. That remark cost me three teeth and two weeks in the "reflection cell," a hole in the ground too small to stand in and too wet to sit in.</p>

    <p>They say the Chairman is the "Red Sun in our hearts." A fitting metaphor. He is indeed a sun—a nuclear ball of gas that scorches the earth, dries up the rivers, and blinds anyone foolish enough to look directly at him. Under this Red Sun, we do not grow; we wither.</p>

    <hr style="border-color: #333; opacity: 0.5; margin: 30px 0;">

    <p>My crime? "Maliciously attacking the Great Leap Forward." All I did was use a bit of arithmetic. I pointed out that melting down peasant cooking pots to make steel results in two things: useless lumps of metal and peasants who cannot cook. I wrote an essay titled <em>"On the Logical Fallacies of Planting Crops Too Close Together."</em> I cited agricultural texts from the Han Dynasty to the Qing. I argued that physics does not care about revolutionary zeal.</p>

    <p>For this, they labeled me an "Ultra-Rightist." A "Running Dog of the Chiang Clique."</p>

    <p>Ah, <strong>Chiang Kai-shek</strong>. The Generalissimo. The Gimo.</p>

    <p>In this frozen hell, he has become my God. I close my eyes and I see him. Not the bald, defeated warlord described in the <em>People's Daily</em>, but a shining knight of Confucian virtue. I imagine the island of Taiwan. It must be a paradise. A Greco-Roman utopia of logic, law, and liberty.</p>

    <p>I imagine the streets of Taipei. Surely, they are paved with marble. Intellectuals there must walk with their heads held high, wearing silk gowns, discussing philosophy in tea houses without fear of being reported by their own children. In Taiwan, the press must be free—wildly free! I bet a man like me could publish anything there. I bet I could write a book called <em>"The Joy of Criticizing the Government,"</em> and Generalissimo Chiang would invite me to tea to thank me for my constructive feedback.</p>

    <hr style="border-color: #333; opacity: 0.5; margin: 30px 0;">

    <p><strong>The Interrogation.</strong></p>

    <p>I am dragged into the interrogation room. A single lightbulb swings overhead. The Commissar sits behind a desk, smoking a cigarette. The smoke smells like heaven.</p>

    <p>"Li Ao," the Commissar says, tossing a file on the table. "You are stubborn. Your fellow prisoners have all confessed. They admit they were poisoned by feudal thoughts. Why can't you just say you love the Party?"</p>

    <p>I adjust my broken glasses. One lens is missing, the other is cracked like a spiderweb. "Commissar, I cannot love a Party that treats syntax like a counter-revolutionary crime. I read your wall posters. The grammar is atrocious. You simplified the characters so much that 'love' (愛) no longer has a 'heart' (心) in it. How can I love without a heart?"</p>

    <p>The Commissar slams his fist. "You arrogant intellectual stinking ninth! You think you are better than the workers and peasants?"</p>

    <p>"I <em>am</em> better," I reply calmly. "Not because of my birth, but because I read books instead of burning them. You talk about the 'New China.' I see only the old tyranny wrapped in new red cloth. Qin Shi Huang buried 460 scholars alive; you have buried 460,000, and you didn't even have the decency to dig the holes first."</p>

    <p>"You worship Chiang Kai-shek!" he screams. "You are a spy for the KMT!"</p>

    <p>"I am not a spy. I am a patriot," I sneer. "The Republic of China is the legitimate government. The Constitution of 1947 is the only law I recognize. You are the rebels. You are the bandits. You are a temporary stain on 5,000 years of history. Do you think this madness will last? Do you think destroying the Four Olds will erase the memory of the people? One day, this era will be looked upon as a dark comedy, and I... I will be the punchline that stuck in your throat."</p>

    <p>The Commissar pulls out his pistol and pistol-whips me across the face. I taste blood. It tastes metallic, like the useless steel from the backyard furnaces.</p>

    <hr style="border-color: #333; opacity: 0.5; margin: 30px 0;">

    <p><strong>The Execution Ground.</strong></p>

    <p>They drag me out at dawn. They say it is for "Counter-Revolutionary Incitement" and "Refusing to Reform." They tie my hands behind my back with rough hemp rope. They force me to kneel in the snow, alongside a former landlord and a teacher who taught English.</p>

    <p>A crowd has gathered. Peasants, students, Red Guards with their armbands. They shout slogans. <em>"Down with Li Ao!" "Crush the reactionary insect!"</em></p>

    <p>I look at them. I do not feel fear. I feel pity. Look at them, foaming at the mouth, waving their little red books. They are not humans; they are a herd. They have traded their brains for a bowl of rice and a sense of belonging.</p>

    <p>I refuse to kneel. The guard kicks the back of my knees, but I struggle back up. I will die standing. I will die like a man.</p>

    <p>I look to the Southeast. Towards the sea. Towards the island.</p>

    <p><em>Oh, Taiwan. My beautiful, imaginary Taiwan.</em></p>

    <p>I see it so clearly now. The white sun in the blue sky. I see the Generalissimo standing on a balcony, waving to a free and prosperous people. I see myself there, clad not in these rags, but in a sharp suit, holding a pen that is sharper than any sword. In that world, I am a hero. In that world, I am free.</p>

    <p>The executioner chambers a round. The metallic <em>clack-clack</em> is the loudest sound in the world.</p>

    <p>I take a deep breath. The air is cold, but my blood is boiling with defiance. I will not give them the satisfaction of silence. I will give them a final lesson in history.</p>

    <p>"Fools!" I roar, my voice cracking but carrying across the frozen field. "You can kill my body, but you cannot kill the Spirit of the Republic! You are building a castle on sand! History will judge you! The ink of the scholar lasts longer than the blood of the martyr!"</p>

    <p>"Ready!" the officer shouts.</p>

    <p>I lift my head. I look past the gray sky, past the red flags, staring directly into the eyes of history.</p>

/*
Welcome to Astro's Variable Headquarters
This is a fairly simple function you can add to your mods. It will create a little menu in which the player can view the numbers laid out within the functions.
This is a great way to give the player a little more information about your mod.

Across this code, you will find a lot of aspects you can edit. I have left plenty of comments to help you understand what each part does.
Don't be afraid to ask in #mod-help on the Discord for clarification or help with editing this code.

To use this, place this code below your Code 2, and edit it as needed. You can duplicate the 'let a = document.createElement('p');' section to add more lines of text.

Functions are referenced in text like so: ' + function + '. This will display the number from the function in the text.
Credit to Nina, who made the original code that summoned the new screen (originally for the 1960Red/1952Blue advisor screen)
Go ahead and use this code in your mods - just give me credit. I hope it helps you out!
