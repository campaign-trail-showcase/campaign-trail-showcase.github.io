A sea of people stood and filled the streets, many of which drove 10 or more hours just to witness the Messiah, the Divine, the Bern.</p><p>“Bernie! Bernie! Bernie!”</p><p>The cold November sky was still light, the election had been called almost before the votes were counted. Everyone already knew. Everyone thought it was all but a formality, but that didn't stop a crowd as big as multiple packed football stadiums to show up. The cold wind bothered many of the attendees but they didn't care.</p><p>On the other side of the curtin stood Senator Bernie Sanders. His toothy grin and tender laugh was more present then ever. However, he stood still and quiet, fully taking in the moment. Everything he had worked for came to this. He had let the weight of history press down against his weary frame.</p><p>He had won.</p<p>Not just won, not just obliterated, but massacred Mitt Romney. 538. A clean sweep. A perfect run. The polls, the pundits, and even his own party elites thought it was impossible. Especially against Romney, who had a respectable showing just 4 years prior. The American people had not just spoken, but screamed for Bernie Sanders. He had all the people, money and power now to do what he wanted. Universal healthcare, tuition-free public colleges, the end of corporate dominance over Washington.</p><p>The roaring applause from inside the ballroom was deafening when his wife Jane squeezed his hand. “Go make history,” she whispered to him.</p><p>He stepped onto the stage, blinding lights beamed down, and the cheers were thunderous. His hands trembled a little as he raised them to wave. Whether it was from the emotion or exhaustion, he couldn't tell, nor did he care. The crowd’s energy was unlike anything he had ever seen or felt before.</p><p>He gripped the edges of the podium as the room slowly quieted down as best as it could. He took a steady breath and began to speak.</p><p>“My friends—“</p><p>The roar couldn't be contained, it forced him to pause as a tired but genuine grin came across his face. He waited for a second, savoring it all in. When the crowd finally hushed, he leaned in once more.</p><p>“This victory—this incredible, unprecedented victory—does not belong to me, but to all of you here today. It belongs to the working people of this great nation who fought and stood up to the 1% and finally demanded a government that works for them and not just the billionaires!”</p><p>Another eruption came over the crowd. He continued on, the fire in his voice rising.</p><p>“For decades we have been told that things cannot and will not change! That we must accept the status quo as is! That real change is a dream and a dream only, but tonight—“ He pounded on the podium for dramatic effect. “Tonight, the American people have sent a message to all of us that we will no longer accept a system that favors the few, and not the many!”</p><p>His chest tightened a little, and his breath grew shallower. Still, he carried on.</p><p>“We will fight for Medicare for All! We will fight for universal education! We will fight for a government that will finally represent the working class and its ever growing needs!”</p><p>The cheers became deafening again. The room seemed to shake with the sheer force of all the voices. But something was wrong.</p><p>His vision blurred. A pain hit his left arm, spreading up to his chest. His fingers curled involuntarily, and his knees began to buckle. His world tilted. The sound of the crowd morphed into a reverbed jumble of noise, as though he suddenly were underwater.</p><p>Jane’s voice was frantic, barely cutting through the noise and fog.</p><p>“Bernie?”</p><p>His heart pounded wildly, and erratically one second, and then slowed to the pace of a spriting turtle the next.</p><p>The podium tilted as his grip failed. He saw the ceiling lights, blinding and white as he collapsed backward, swallowed by the deafening noise of the crowd.</p><p>The last thing he saw was the banner on the ceiling, his face staring back at him.</p><p>The banner had read,</p><p><b>“Feel The Bern.”</b></p>`)

Former Senator, presidential candidate, and failure Bernie Sanders walked through the dimly lit streets of New York City. His ragged coat had barely shielded him from the biting wind. The city once was his safe haven—his rallies packing squares and sending young progressives into euphoria. But that seems almost forever ago now.</p><p>The election was a massacre. Not just a loss, not just a humiliation but an outright massacre. Not a single state. Not even Vermont. Not even DC. America turned its back on him and in response, Bernie turned his back on America, albeit, not by choice.</p><p>The weeks after his defeat had been a blur of rejection and sorrow for the former Senator. He had gone further left, deeper into his “political revolution” as he called it. In his speeches, Bernie spoke of the proletariat, and of the failures of just mere democratic socialism.</p><p>He had, in his mind at least, became a true revolutionary. Gus Hall, the old Communist Party candidate, who was once a relic of the past and deemed to be forgotten by all, was now Bernie’s prophet. In his mind, Bernie was convinced he was ahead of the time. In one of Bernie’s last televised speeches, he stated how he would take up the banner where Hall had left it.</p><p>But the country didn't care, nor did any of them listen. His followers faded away, one by one, unwilling to be connected alongside a man who spoke so fondly of Stalin and the atrocities of communism.</p><p>His wife, Jane, left him next. She endured it all. She endured the campaign, the debates, and the long nights of strategy. But she couldn't endure her husband ranting at a dry wall, speaking and yelling at himself in the mirror, as if he didn’t know who he was anymore. Couldn't recognize his own face.</p><p>Just when it seemed like Bernie had finally lost it all, the money dried up. The last of the donations came in, the book deals were rejected, and the speaking invitations never came to his doorstep anymore. One day, Jane changed the lock on the house as well.</p><p>Now, Bernie went around with a slow, shuffled walk. A man who had been cast out from history. No longer a Senator, no longer any sort of leader, no longer a husband even. Just another forgotten figure of the millions in New York City.</p><p>His once commanding voice, the one that spoke to tens of millions, was now a mumble. A half-hearted, unfocused mumble.</p><p>The streetlights flickered overhead as he collapsed onto a park bench. The cold metal pressing against his now thin frame. He stared up at the night sky, his breath visible and frigid now.</p><p><b>He doesn’t get up from the park bench. He does not move. He sits there until the lamp post above him suddenly burns out and he vanishes into the darkness of the night.</b></p>`)

Our “special assets”, particularly Gabbard, regularly share intelligence and latest developments.</p><p>Attached are possible war plans with Iran procured from Romney Administration and locations of US spies in the wider Middle East region. Sanders has made clear, in public and private, that the United States will withdraw fully from Afghanistan and pull many troops from other bases in this part of the world. If this comes to pass, it will no doubt allow the motherland to expand her influence.</p><p>While on the topic, we have worked with our American assets to quell opposition to Sanders Administration. Unfortunately, American media is a difficult beast to bring under control, regularly demeaning the president and his allies, even accusing them of being assets to the motherland. The division is good for us, of course, but to bring America completely to heel, all opposition must be dealt with. Two men, specifically.</p><p>De-facto Republican Party leader Rubio is one. He has been vocal against nearly every aspect of Sanders agenda, and has been building support and voter base. We are working with a different asset in preparation for a potential Rubio campaign in the 2020 election. Expect a call in the near future about a visit to Moscow. He wants to bring his hotel enterprise to Russia.</p><p>The other is Special Counsel Mueller. Despite public upbeat attitude, Sanders and Gabbard have expressed concern with probe, yet they are too scared to act. It is odd, considering they had little issue with removing FBI Director Comey, but they live in constant fear of exposure. Perhaps if your talks with Sanders go well in Helsinki, then we can provide reward by solving this issue, should Mueller find himself looking out an open window or enjoying a last meal.</p><p>I maintain great confidence in the ability of the Operation to succeed. To paraphrase the folk song Sanders sang with us in ‘88: This land will be our land.</p>`)

Kemp, who resigned as Secretary of State earlier today, has denied Abrams’ claims and accused her of “inciting violence”.</p><p>It’s been a tense and turbulent period for the country ever since the foiled assasination attempt on President Mitt Romney by Bernie Sanders supporter James T. Hodgkinson and the divisive 2016 election campaign. Millions across the nation have participated in protests in recent years condemning the political violence and the crackdown in Republican-ran states. The National Guard has regularly been deployed against peaceful protesters in states like Texas, Florida and Georgia, and as you can see behind me, that is the case tonight.</p><p>Outgoing Governor Nathan Deal in a press conference said he was mobilizing the National Guard to “maintain law and order”. He pointed to last year’s nationwide riots following the assassination of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and stressed he did not want a repeat in the city of Atlanta. He also mentioned calling President Romney for federal assistance following credible assassination threats against both Kemp and Abrams.</p><p>Today’s protests have been mostly peaceful, certainly compared to yesterday, yet tensions remain high. You can see burnt out cars along the street and damaged windows from yesterday’s riots and the protesters are contained here tonight by law enforcement.

Yet this new conspiracy theory, propagating in progressive circles rather than conservative ones for a change, might be the strangest one yet.</p><p>It’s been described as President Bernie Sanders’ supporters justification for the abandonment of many policies he promoted during the campaign, from a universal single-payer healthcare system known as Medicare for All to free secondary education and the elimination of all student debt.</p><p>Cenk Uygur, host of the left-wing The Young Turks talk show, pinpointed the shifting in stances began upon Sanders’ selection of then-primary rival Clinton as running mate, “It all began the moment he picked her as his VP choice. From there, it has been completely downhill. Why would you run away from the policies that won you the nomination: Medicare for All, free college education, ending the endless wars in the Middle East? It has nothing to do with ‘pivoting to the center’ as many so-called experts want to claim. Romney’s numbers were in the toilet. Something’s going on.”</p><p>From there, left-wing conspiracy theorists have put forward increasingly absurd claims:</p><ul><li>Sanders was never a true progressive.</li><li>Nancy Pelosi bribed Sanders to conform with the party establishment.</li><li>Sanders is a globalist puppet.</li><li>The “Clinton mafia” threatened to kill Sanders if he did not abandon his policies.</li><li>The “Clinton mafia” <em>did</em> kill Sanders and replaced him with a compliant clone.</li></ul><p>The drama has been celebrated in right-wing circles, and in some cases, they have even fed into the conspiracies.

He has announces that he will nominate Judge Sri Srinivasan of the D.C. Court of Appeals to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. Srinivasan is the first Indian American, Asian American and Hindu candidate for the Supreme Court.</p><p>The president lauded Judge Srinivasan’s credentials during a press briefing, “I picked him because he is the most capable candidate out there. He’s intelligent, well-educated, kind, reasonable and committed to overturning <em>Citizens United</em> as well as preserving <em>Roe v. Wade</em> as the law of the land.”</p><p>Srinivasan is the second candidate to fill Justice Scalia’s seat, after the ill-fated nomination of D.C. Court of Appeals Chief Judge Merrick Garland by former President Mitt Romney. Garland’s nomination stalled in the Senate thanks to lockstep opposition from the Democrats, in addition to outrage from conservative Republicans.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) expressed confidence in confirming Srinivasan, “Judge Srinivasan is a great choice for the Supreme Court and I have no doubt we’ll be able to confirm him.” When asked about the possibility of needing to abolish the filibuster, also know as invoking the “nuclear option”, in case of united opposition from Republicans, Schumer demurred, “I don’t think so. Republicans know we can’t leave this seat open indefinitely. The people want President Sanders’ choice on the Court.”</p><p>The nuclear option may end up being needed as Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has vowed to block Srinivasan’s nomination, “Frankly, the Democrats screwed us with their little stunt last year and now they expect us to help them confirm the most radical nominee for the Supreme Court I’ve ever seen. That’s not going to happen. Mark my words, not a single Republican is going to vote for confirmation.”</p><p>All signs point to another long and drawn-out nomination battle.</p>`)

Sitting in a booth high above everyone else, the ex-vice president was reportedly there on a friend’s recommendation, and had been quite excited to see the all-American production.</p><p>After seemingly enjoying the show, a source noted that her mood quickly soured when a disgruntled cast member walked out on stage after the musical ended.</p><p>The cast member, who has not yet been identified but reportedly played a background character meant to represent the “bullet” that takes Hamilton’s life, grabbed a mic, shouted up at Clinton and read a letter from an unknown sender. At this point, it became clear to audience members that the entire cast was standing behind the “bullet” and that this was a message from the whole cast.</p><p>The letter read, in part, “Vice President Clinton, while we thank you for attending, we wanted to make clear: we represent the diverse America that took great insult to your walking out of a good administration just because it fought for real change. You threw away your shot, and let all of us down.”</p><p>This subsequently caused commotion in the audience. Many of them turned to boo Clinton, while others jeered those who were booing. Cast members also reportedly heard obscenities directed at them following the reading.</p><p>The verbal attacks turned physical when somebody threw a phone at the ”bullet”. Former Vice President Clinton was ushered out of the building by the time punches were thrown.</p><p>Former Vice President Clinton has not yet commented on the incident, though prominent Republican donor and 2020 presidential primary contender Donald Trump tweeted: “The wonderful, heroic VP Hillary Clinton, who took a stand against such an Evil Socialist Administration that she was COERCED and FORCED into being part of in the first place, was harassed by the TERRIBLE cast of the WORSE musical Hamilton (Very sad!). This should not be allowed to happen, President Burnt-Out Sanders should be ASHAMED, though he may have been RESPONSIBLE.”</p><p>The White House did not respond to requests for comment.</p>`)

Many of these problems stem from former President Reagan’s “trickle-down” economics, which theorized that giving money to the richest among us, the business elites and such, would eventually find its way to the working population through increased wages and bigger economic growth. It’s safe to conclude at this point that that is not the case as the wealth gap is bigger than ever, while nearly 40 million Americans live below the poverty line.</p><p><em>Some would claim</em> that the strides made during the Sanders Administration towards reform of the United States healthcare system and labor laws have lessened these problems. In reality, they have only exacerbated them. Take the twelve dollar an hour federal minimum wage, for example. President Sanders had originally wanted to shoot for a fifteen dollar an hour plan, and had just enough support for it, until his vice president indicated she would cast the tie breaking vote and kill the bill if the number wasn’t negotiated down. McCaskill, the vice president at the time, wanted a bill that already could only provide a salary of thirty thousand before tax, to be brought down even lower.</p><p>This is one of the many examples of how the dysfunctional relationship between Sanders and his vice president prevented real, substantive reform that had a noticeable statistical impact on the average US citizen. Though union membership increased in Sanders tenure, real wages shrunk. Though more people got healthcare, premiums increased. These statistics, that look good on the surface but carry a heavy downside, have led many affluent (read: ignorant) Americans to conclude progress has been achieved where it has not.</p>`)

Without mentioning the president by name, he urged the Sanders Administration to take a cautious approach to its planned withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p><p>“I understand the desire to pull America out of a long-term war,” Romney said. “It’s something this administration is passionate about. I wouldn’t do it—I’d listen to the generals on the ground—but if you’re going to do it, please, be smart about it. Take it slow and prioritize the brave Afghans who helped us during the war. And make sure the Taliban doesn’t topple the democratically elected government.”</p><p>The White House in a statement told CBS News that, “President Sanders is committed to ending this disastrous war that should never have been started. He is aware of potential complications and will ensure a smooth and orderly withdrawal.”</p><p>Romney has consistently held hawkish views on the war in Afghanistan, increasing troop levels in 2014. Military experts say the troop surge led to increased volatility on the ground and “made things worse, not better,” according to one military expert.</p><p>“Romney’s ‘listen to the generals’ approach was’t ever going to work because this is an unwinnable war. Our military are trained to never accept defeat, to always believe in a path to victory. Unfortunately, that’s not realistic in Afghanistan.”</p><p>The expert went on to echo Romney’s word of caution, “He is absolutely correct when he says to be careful about any kind of withdrawal. I mean, we’ve all heard the rumors that Sanders wants to close Bagram. It would be catastrophic if the Taliban got a hold of the weapons on that base.”</p>`)

For a while it was a three-way, with Clinton and Sanders constantly sniping at each other and Biden hanging on as the third wheel, but fortunes turned for Sanders after Biden dropped out and picked his side.</p><p>At the time, Clinton was furious. She knew she was gonna lose to an outsider once again. She tried everything to stop the inevitable, from trashing Biden behind the scenes to accusing Sanders of quid pro quo. She even tried to drag Obama into the mess, to corral his unruly former veep, but he wasn’t having it.</p><p>It seemed miraculous when Clinton and Sanders buried the hatchet and joined forces. Two opposing forces meeting in the middle. The yin and the yang coming together to unseat Mitt Romney. Except it didn’t happen. Romney won despite all the hype.</p><p>Ever since, they’ve fallen back into toxicity. They of course blame one another. To this day, Clinton rails against Sanders’ progressivism, that “nobody likes him” and even apologized for joining his ticket in the first place, saying, “It’s all just baloney and I feel so bad that people, including me, got sucked into it.” Sanders always returns fire, whether it’s bringing up her quarter-million dollar a pop speeches to Goldman Sachs or her “goddamn emails”.</p><p>Even the families have gotten in on the action, with former President Bill Clinton telling a crowd in Iowa that Sanders is a “sure-fire loser”.

I’ve watched president after president try to tackle our nation’s issues, whether it was from the Senate or the Naval Observatory. It’s always been a dream of mine to serve as president. It’s why I ran in 1988, 2008, then one last time in 2016. I knew that I could make a difference, be a truly transformational president, the next LBJ, or FDR even. But I also recognize I’m not the only one capable of bringing change.</p><p>That’s what former President Obama campaigned on in 2008. He asked me to be his running mate because he needed someone to help him navigate the Congress. He had a bold vision, but he didn’t have the connections I did to actually try to get his agenda across. I accepted the job because I wanted to be involved in the transformation of our country.</p><p>We had good times together, we really did man. Yet when the tough got going, he faltered. When people pushed him, he fell over like a house of cards. Frankly, he was probably doomed to fail from the start. First of all, he had to rebuild an economy ruined by George Bush and his cronies, that was tough enough, but add healthcare on top of that, it’s demanding. He did, obviously, get it across the finish line, and I’m proud of my work in that, but by the time 2012 came around, he wasn’t the same man. He lost his conviction, the fire in his belly was gone. He was defeated before Mitt Romney made it official.</p><p>I told myself at the time that I too was done. I don’t need to pursue office again, I’ve done what I could. That feeling didn’t last.</p><p>When I saw that most of my fellow Democrats were content to let Hillary cruise to the nomination, I thought to myself, “Man, what the hell are you doing? We need the best possible candidate to beat Mitt Romney. And Hillary, she’s a fine woman, upstanding politician, but is she the one?” And that answer was not clear to me, so I ran once more.</p><p>It was then that I got to see Bernie Sanders in his truest form. We obviously knew each other. We served in the Senate for two years and I was engaged with him during my time as Vice President, but when I saw him at the debates, up close and personal, I saw that fire in his belly. His passion, man, it was off the charts. Still is, even now. He’ll never stop fighting for the American people. That’s what I like about him most.</p><p>It’s also why I agreed to be his running mate. It wasn’t a diss at Obama, or Hillary, nor me being so desperate to get back at Romney, or whatever the hell else people say. It’s because I knew no matter how tough things got, he’d never give up. And he never gave up once during the campaign. Still hasn’t. That’s leadership in its purest form right there.</p><p>Even today, people question my judgment when it comes to Bernie, “Oh don’t you know he’s crazy? Look what you did, he’s branded you a loser. Don’t you have any regrets?”</p><p>No, I don’t regret anything. I’d do it all over again if I have to.</p>`)

And the media wasted no time humiliating him for it.</p><p>The New York Times called it “offensive”. Wolf Blitzer called on the president to “apologize”. A guest “contributor” on MSNBC said Romney should be impeached. If farting is a high crime and misdemeanor, then all presidents before and after should be impeached too.</p><p>That’s not to say the White House has been handling the stink well. After initially pretending it never happened, the White House put out a statement so idiotically worded, it suggested that this happens more often than we think. Of course SNL wasn’t going to let that slip by, with Jason Sudeikis’ Mitt Romney saying in a skit, “Hey, don’t be offended. It’s a common American custom. The stinkier it is, the more we appreciate you.”</p><p>The Romney Administration recognized it was still being talked about and memed to death, so according to them, the solution was to put Mitt Romney on the Tonight Show. And, in case you had your fingers in your ears, it happened. Again. No way Jimmy Fallon and the execs at NBC were letting that end up on the cutting room floor. Romney tried to play it off this time, but it just got everybody talking all over again.</p><p>I mean, c’mon. It was one poorly timed fart. OK, two poorly timed farts, but honestly, let it go. It’s not like Romney threw up in anybody’s lap.</p>`)

Failure is too kind of a word, catastrophic too generous of an adjective. An administration that was born dead from the moment it started because it was born out of pure spite. From the very beginning, Hillary Clinton was elected to office under the premise that not only would the country return to normal, but the Democratic Party would get rid of those pesky Leftists that made the party "unelectable." Obama and Sanders' failed experiences will be swept aside, and a new pragmatic outlook will be implemented where Centrist common sense triumphs over radical Leftism. Ambitious Liberal policy? Reasonable foreign policy? Fighting for things you believe in? Pipe dreams. Hillary was going to show those latte-drinking Communists what getting stuff done truly was.</p><p>And that's exactly what she did. She passed a weak, bare-bones COVID stimulus package for the sake of "bipartisan compromise." She capitulated to the reactionary right on every single issue, with "protecting the border" and "respect for female spaces" becoming all the rage on Democratic think-tanks. She became the Blob's strongest soldier and kept the ball rolling in Afghanistan and the Middle East. She passed unpopular trade agreements that made her extremely popular VP (more about how Sherrod Brown would have saved the day <span style="color: #BEE5FF;"><u>here</u></span>), to abandon the ticket. She ruled the party with an iron fist to make sure that another Bernie Sanders never appears, blocking Progressives from any single race she could get her paws on.</p><p>The Midterms being an absolute massacre should have been a turning point for President Clinton to realize that treating the Left like shit wasn't a viable path forward: they were still going to keep running spoiler candidates if Democrats didn't play ball.</p><p>She didn't.</p><p>Facing a nightmarish scenario against wannabe populist Senator Josh Hawley and his running mate, professional piece of shit Governor Lee Zeldin, where the President was consistently trailing by double-digits and with the party in grave danger of falling apart everywhere, what could possibly go wrong? Nothing really. In fact, we can enumerate all the fantastic things her campaign did in just ten months to win the election:</p><ul><li>Losing Michigan, Vermont, and four other states against activist (bestie <3), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the worst performance for a Democratic incumbent in Primaries since Jimmy Carter.</li><li>Getting two people killed at the DNC because they dared to protest her fantastic foreign policy. She didn't even bother to go to their funerals, by the way.</li><li>Choosing the charisma void entity known as John Hickenlooper as a new running mate.</li><li>Making Bernie Sanders and David Zuckerman stop caucusing with Democrats all together, join the People's Party, and endorse the Turner-Tlaib ticket.</li><li>Calling Joe Rogan a "sexist dipshit" at a rally, causing him to take selfies with Hawley at a Philadelphia brewery.</li><li>Defending the TPP until her face turned purple despite consistently trailing in the Midwest.</li><li>Trying to get Taylor Swift’s endorsement and failing.</li><li>Making rallies with former President Dick Cheney and former Senator Lisa Murkowski, on a very smart play for those sweet Moderate Republican voters. They only needed Larry Hogan's endorsement, and it would be a done deal (he endorsed Hawley one week before the election)!</li><li>Accusing Nina Turner of being a "Khamenei supporter" in the middle of a debate because she said that American bombings of Iran's nuclear facilities didn't accomplish anything.</li></ul><p>The result of this masterpiece of a campaign?</p><ul><li>Becoming the first Democratic candidate in 40 years to lose New York and Maine.</li><li>Becoming the first Democratic candidate in 52 years to lose Minnesota.</li><li>Giving Republicans their first Supermajority in history.</li><li>Making Turkish asset Eric Adams a Senator.</li><li>Making National Socialist Party member Mark Robinson a Governor.</li><li>Losing the popular vote by <strong>11 points</strong>.</li><li>Losing more than <strong>100 House seats</strong> in the last two years, several of them to the Left you wanted to destroy.</li><li>Losing Vermont to a third-party ticket.</li><li>Getting California to single digits.</li></ul><p>The moral of the story? Democrats love losing. <span style="color: #BEE5FF;"><u>Join the People's Party here if you like winning and hate losing.</u></span></p>`)

Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) joined all Republicans voting in favor.</p><p>He initially joined most other U.S. politicians in invoking Israel’s right to defend itself immediately after the devastating October 7 attacks which left over 1,500 dead, 4,000 wounded, and 300 taken hostage by Hamas. Though days later, Sanders condemned Israel’s offensive, calling it “a serious violation and international law” and “cruel.”</p><p>After a warning from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Sanders continued attacking the Israeli response, accusing Netanyahu of using the horrific attack as an excuse to commit “war crimes” and calling on President Klobuchar to cease all military aid to Israel until they ended their military campaign. It was the call to suspend aid that pushed McConnell and Republicans to censure Sanders.</p><p>Explaining why he voted to censure Sanders, Manchin said, “We must be steadfast and resolute in defending Israel after the atrocities committee on October 7th. Hamas must be completely eradicated. Anything less would be supporting violent anti-Semites committed to the destruction of Israel.”</p><p>Sanders, for his part, was unfazed by the vote, “I expected as much, but it’s not going to stop me from criticizing the extremist right-wing and racist government in Israel. The United States must rightly support Israel in their time of need, but that doesn’t mean letting them bomb innocent children.”</p>`)

He accomplished neither goal.</p><p>When the president turned to the topic of healthcare, he could only watch as both members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus and Democrats led by 2016 presidential nominee Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) staged a walk out.</p><p>“The president has made it pretty clear that he’s unserious about tackling the big issues with Obamacare,” said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH). “After all, it was based off of his plan in Massachusetts. Why should we trust him?”</p><p>When asked whether there was coordination with the Democrats, Jordan was direct, “Absolutely not. They have their own problems with Romney’s proposals. They want to implement communist, government-run healthcare. We want government completely out of the healthcare business.”</p><p>Sanders, who campaigned on his signature Medicare for All healthcare plan during the 2016 campaign, took President Romney to task over his healthcare agenda, “I swear, every time the president puts out a new plan, it gets worse. Now he wants to gut your Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid—anything to appease the far-right. I won’t have it.”</p><p>After a heckler suggested Sanders walked out because he was bitter over his election defeat, Sanders shot back, “Losing the election doesn’t mean I’m going to stop fighting the oligarchy.”</p><p>In a statement, White House Communications Director Scott Jennings pushed back on the bipartisan criticisms, “The Romney Administration is committed to hearing from all sides, but the fact of the matter is we have consistently put forward sensible, conservative legislation that will transform that healthcare system so it benefits all Americans. We’ve talked extensively with Democrats and the Freedom Caucus with nothing to show for it. Rather than having an impossible list of demands, it’s time for them to meet us in the middle.”</p>`)
