Your supporters are shocked at how you could've lost, considering the fact that you had a lead early on. They're calling fraud, but it's up to you whether you concede or not.<p>\n<p>Rubio's agenda should be passed with ease. With a small republican majority in both the House and the Senate, it seems like he should have a nice 4 years aside from the occasional tight vote on a bill.</p>\n<p>He'll likely be a decent president. One that few people remember in the future, and one whose policies don't last unless his successor wins in 2024 (if he wins the 2020 election).</p>",
