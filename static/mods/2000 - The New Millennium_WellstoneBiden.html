<br><br>
The crowd booms as you step up to the podium. Hundreds of men and women with lives, all as deep and rich and complex as yours, they all came to see you speak, to see you assume the position as their new leader. It fills you with a sense of pride and gratitude, you know you couldn’t do it without them, as easy as it is to claim it all for yourself, it’s theirs too. Like you did when you got the nomination, all you could do is take in the breeze and the sound of the crowd, it fills you with a certain strength in your heart. 
<br><br>
“Thank you.” Is all you open with. It comes out unexpectedly terse and emotional. You really meant it. “For everything you have done.” You start again. “To think that together, we put a schoolteacher from Minnesota into the White House. You believed in me, in my vision and project, and I promise I will do everything in my power to not let you down.” The crowd cheers. “The real fight has just begun, for affordable healthcare, for clean air, for good schools, for an America in which everybody can prosper, not just the few.” 
<br><br>
“In creating a more perfect union, we move forward with a programme that will detail an expansion of societal wealth that we can all share. It is not because of me, but it is because America wants to believe in a better future. Together we will make a government that works for people!” You receive an expected surge of cheers from your crowd for that statement, but it still feels real. It feels almost unreal, actually, like something from a dream, the kind of thing you might’ve fondly fantasized about in the teacher staffroom in between classes.
<br><br>
You grip the podium, feel its cold, wooden material against your hands. It’s real. You’re living it. You take a moment in your head to thank everybody before you who has given you this, everybody who believed in you from the start, the day 1 organizers who gave it their all, believing it was a longshot bid, all of them. Just don’t give it all away, don’t let yourself lose the flame, because, in the end at least, it’ll work out fine.

        return `<strong>Nostalgia</strong>
<br><br>
It wasn’t the cleanest thing ever but you did it. I guess America loves an underdog story. gives you a sense of Deja Vu to see you whip Forbes like you did with Boschwitz all those years back. The feeling of nostalgia is somewhat warm, it feels like memories of days at the park with mom, or when you began biking again and remembered the schoolhood days of biking with friends. A small smile comes on your face just having those memories come back to you.
<br><br>
Packing to prepare to move to the White House you find a collection of photos, many of them of you as a small boy. It makes you laugh, for a second, to believe that little boy in his corduroy pants is the next president. But it is the next president, and even more that little boy in his corduroy pants, smiling like he has the world, that’s you. It feels like you’re reconciling the different parts of yourself, coming together, it was always Paul Wellstone, and you have always unapologetically been you.
<br><br>
You wonder if there’s any such thing as destiny, was that little boy always going to be president? Was he always going to become a teacher? Become a senator? It doesn’t really matter, you’re here regardless, and you should be happy, because even if you weren’t destined to have it, that might make it richer, because it was by your merit you’re here. `;

<br><br>
You tried to suppress the defeatism in your heart, but sometimes you don’t win. It stings, but it’s part of it all, part of living, you tell yourself. You were counted out from the beginning, the establishment wasn’t willing to rally for you, the polls put you behind. Many Democrats thought you were dead on arrival, It wrestles within you for a moment, the possibility. Were you? Was it insurmountable? 
<br><br>
	You settle on not knowing. You couldn’t know, because you can’t see other worlds, nor can you do it again. You accept it. Like a dagger through the heart, it slides out your chest, dropping on the floor, it hurts, but you have a life to live. You’re only 56. You have people, you have opportunities, there will always be people who want to hear you. You could keep going, for them, Minnesota will offer you another chance, they have been kind to you.
<br><br>
	The fight is not over, this just was a battle, not the war, you can pick things back up, get back in the game. It will sting, it tends to hurt that way, but you aren’t finished. You can go back to doing what you did before. It was still important, people still believed in you, tens of millions came out to vote for you, that’s something, they took their time to support you. You want to cry for a moment, but it passes, you will live to fight for another day.`;

<br><br>
Watching the screen rattle off states, one by one, all for Forbes, you feel like a gutted fish. You knew you were a longshot bid, you knew you didn’t have the same money, the knack for party politicking. But this was different. You tug at your shirt with intensity. This was a collapse, the polls, they didn’t put you in the lead from the gate, but you didn’t think it would be this bad. Is your project, your ideas, are they this unpopular?
<br><br>
Or was it you? Were you the problem? Should you have let somebody else take up the mantle? Did you not commit enough? Should you have gone even more radical? Or was it just doomed from the start? Should you have retreated? Become a pale, weak, imitation of Clinton? Is that all they wanted of you? Your head buzzes with these questions, but there’s no way you can not put this on your own head, you chose wrong, you acted wrong, you did things wrong. There’s no redo, you can’t go back. You have to live with it forever.
<br><br>
You have to deal with the fact that the lost potential you represented is gone forever. The America you believed in, it wasn’t going to exist, not for a long time, anyways. The election showed that the America you believe in is not the America that they want to believe in. You almost get angry at them, the voters, for a moment, but it all comes back to you. You will have to live with this ghost haunting you forever. `;
