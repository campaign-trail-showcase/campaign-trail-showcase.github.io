<p>After a long run, Pete's done it. He has become America's first openly gay president. An impressive feat, I have to say. What can we expect in his first term? Well, Democrats have narrowly won the House and have a tied Senate. We'll see what Pete's able to do, but the prospect of increased gun control, Medicare for all who want it, and other moderate Democratic reforms is looking rather likely. Trump supporters all across America are disappointed, but now what do we have ahead?</p>

<p>Well we've seen UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis both eyeing up 2024 runs, we might also see another heavyweight like Senator and 2012 Presidential Nominee Mitt Romney try his hand at it. Depending on how much Pete gets done in his second term, of course. We congratulate Pete on his victory, now to the next panel.</p>`;

Despite the many concerns raised over President Trump's health, policy, and past, he has defied the odds again and won. Donald Trump truly is an electoral miracle, isn't he? Facing a young, energetic, moderate challenger with a bright future ahead. Now all gone, either way, what can we now expect in Trump's next term? Well, I'd say expect more of what we saw in his first term, even if Trump's win will be a net negative, a positive aspect is that he'll be able to effectively fight COVID-19 without having to worry about an upcoming transition. Now will he finish the wall? Maybe this is a big win for the MAGA movement, who'll now most likely get to decide who's the nominee in 2024, but it's a long time until then.</p>

<p>Well, what about the future for Pete then? Well, it's unclear, he is still young and could definitely run for elected office in the future. Many Democrats believe he'd be a great candidate for the Senate, and if he runs, it's hard to see him losing a primary considering the name recognition alone. But enough of speculation; Trump's next term is going to be well <em>interesting.</em> Now over to the next panel.</p>`;

<p>Soon you find out that the house is almost guaranteed to be blue, congratulations Mr. President! That being said, the Senate is tied 50-50 it's unclear wheter Pence can break the tie and he has already sued. The case goes to the 6-3 Supreme court which rules 5-4 that Pence can indeed break the tie.</p>

This creates quite a interesting dynamic where your Vice President is quite hostile. You have also not been the friendliest towards Pence during your run and he is already eying up the 2024 republican nomination potentially causing a President vs Vice President election? Either way, congratulations Mr. President, you will be America's first openly gay president and Chasten America's first, "First Gentleman"!`;
