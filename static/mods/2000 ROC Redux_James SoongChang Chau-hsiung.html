Our determination is clear: this election is no longer a contest between the Pan-Blue and Pan-Green camps, but a showdown between the clean current and 'black gold' corruption. We will tell the entire nation that we will carry this mandate of millions and advance without hesitation to win the final victory!"

            <p>The streets of Taipei have vanished. They have been replaced by a surging, screaming, weeping ocean of Orange. From the high balcony of the "New Taiwanese Service Team" headquarters, the view is terrifying in its majesty. It is not a political rally anymore; it is a coronation. The rain that has plagued the city all day has stopped, as if the heavens themselves dare not rain on this parade. The air smells of wet asphalt, heavy incense, and the raw, electric scent of absolute power.</p>
            
            <p>You, <strong>James Soong (Soong Chu-yu)</strong>, stand before the mirror in the private waiting room. You adjust your tie. You look at the man in the glass. You are no longer the "Governor." You are no longer the "Defector." You are the <strong>President</strong>. And not just a President by a margin of error. The television screens behind you are screaming the numbers that will be etched into granite: <strong>${quickstats[1].toFixed(1)}%</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>It is a massacre. You have not just defeated your enemies; you have annihilated them. <strong>Lien Chan</strong> and the KMT machine—with their billions of dollars and their "Black Gold" networks—have been reduced to single digits in some districts. <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong>, the self-proclaimed "Son of Taiwan," has been crushed under the weight of your populist juggernaut. You have taken the South. You have taken the North. You have taken the Hakkas, the Minnan, the Mainlanders, and the indigenous tribes. You have united the island under the banner of one man.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chen Wan-shui</strong>, your wife—beloved by the public as "Wan-shui Jiejie" (Sister Wan-shui)—walks over to you. She is beaming, radiating that warmth that softened your sharp edges throughout the brutal campaign. She straightens your lapel, her eyes shining with pride and relief. "You did it, Chu-yu," she whispers. "You beat him. You beat the old man."</p>
            
            <p>She doesn't need to say the name. <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong>. The "Godfather." The man who used you, discarded you, and tried to destroy you with the "Chung Hsing Bills" scandal. Somewhere in the Presidential Palace, just a few blocks away, Lee must be sitting in the dark, trembling. This victory is your ultimate revenge. You haven't just taken his job; you have destroyed his legacy. The KMT is dead, killed by the very man Lee exiled.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chang Chao-hsiung</strong>, your running mate, the respectable doctor who gave your ticket its moral weight, is shaking hands with the staff. He looks almost dazed by the scale of the victory. "It’s a mandate for a new epoch," Chang says, adjusting his glasses. "The people didn't just want a change of government. They wanted a savior."</p>
            
            <p>The room is filled with the architects of this miracle. The staff of the "New Taiwanese Service Team"—the embryonic structure of what will surely become the new ruling party—are in a state of delirium. Famous figures from the <strong>New Party</strong>, like <strong>Jaw Shaw-kong</strong> and <strong>Yok Mu-ming</strong>, who threw their tactical support behind you to stop independence, are raising toasts. They think they have elected a unificationist ally. They think they can control you. They are wrong. With 45% of the vote, you belong to no one. You are the Sun around which all planets must now orbit.</p>
            
            <p>You step out onto the main floor. The roar is deafening. <em>"Song Shengzhang! Song Zongtong!"</em> (Governor Soong! President Soong!). It is a wall of sound that hits you in the chest.</p>
            
            <p>You see the faces of the people. The veterans in their raincoats, the housewives waving orange flags, the taxi drivers who plastered your face on their cabs. They look at you with a religious fervor. To them, you are the man who actually <em>worked</em>. The man who visited every township. The man who fixed the roads and built the bridges while the elites in Taipei played power games. A-Bian promised them dignity; you promised them prosperity and competence. And tonight, competence won by a landslide.</p>
            
            <p>A frantic aide runs up with a mobile phone. "It's A-Bian," he says breathlessly. "He wants to concede."</p>
            
            <p>You take the phone. You imagine <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong> on the other end, the firebrand lawyer finally silenced. "Mr. Chen," you say, your voice smooth, authoritative, dripping with the magnanimity of the conqueror. "You fought a spirited campaign. But Taiwan has chosen stability. I hope you will work with me in the 'Grand Coalition' government I plan to form." You hang up before he can answer. You don't need the DPP. You don't need the KMT. You are the State.</p>
            
            <p>You walk toward the balcony. The lights are blinding. The confetti cannons fire, filling the air with a blizzard of orange paper. As you look out over the sea of supporters, a feeling swells in your chest—a dangerous, intoxicating expansion of the ego. You feel ten feet tall.</p>
            
            <p>"My fellow Taiwanese!" you bellow into the microphone. The feedback squeals, then dies into the roar of the crowd.</p>
            
            <p>"They said it was impossible! They said the parties were too strong! They said a man without a party could not lead this nation!"</p>
            
            <p>You pause for effect. You raise a fist. "But look at us tonight! We have proven that the will of the people is stronger than any machine! We have proven that the 'New Taiwanese' are not Green, they are not Blue—they are the colors of the earth, the colors of the harvest!"</p>
            
            <p>You look toward the Presidential Palace in the distance. You can almost feel <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong>'s presence fading, like a ghost being exorcised. You have beaten the accusations of corruption. You have beaten the "Black Gold." You have beaten the independence radicals.</p>
            
            <p>But amidst the adoration, there is a shadow. With this much power—<strong>${quickstats[1].toFixed(1)}%</strong>—there are no excuses left. You are not a minority president. You are an Emperor. The expectations are astronomical. The people expect you to solve the Cross-Strait crisis, fix the economy, and clean up the government, all by the sheer force of your personality.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chen Wan-shui</strong> squeezes your hand. "Smile, Chu-yu," she says softly. "The whole world is watching."</p>
            
            <p>You smile. It is the smile of a man who knows he has written his name into history with indelible ink. The era of the parties is over. The era of Soong Chu-yu has begun.</p>

        <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: right; margin-bottom: 30px; font-size: 0.85em;">
            By David C. W. Chang (Researcher, North American Taiwanese Human Rights Foundation) | January 18, 2020 (Published via Liberty Times International)
        </p>

        <h3>Preamble: Rage and Powerlessness—A Stolen Election</h3>
        <p>
            As President James Soong wins his fifth presidential term in 2020 with his 'uncontested' posture, sitting overseas, I feel only utter powerlessness. The democracy we fought for was not overthrown by a military coup, but was <u>systematically gutted</u> by a <strong>technocrat in a suit, shouting 'efficiency,' in broad daylight</strong>, through constitutional loopholes!
        </p>
        <p>
            This is not an election; this is a humiliation of the Taiwanese people's sovereignty! His overwhelming victory in 2000 (over 45%) should have been a moment for reform, but it became a <strong>poison</strong> for his limitless personal expansion of power. Soong, a politician forged under the authoritarian system, never truly believed in checks and balances. He only believes in himself.
        </p>

        <h3>I. The Core of 'Soong-Style Efficiency': The Emasculation of Democracy</h3>
        <p>
            What is Soong’s 'efficiency'? It is turning the Legislative Yuan into a rubber stamp, the judiciary into a tool of obedience, and reducing all dissenting voices to <strong>'emotional noise' that 'impedes national development'</strong>!
        </p>
        <p>
            His governance from 2000 to 2008, while seemingly stable, was actually laying the groundwork for the future <strong>return of authoritarianism</strong>. Unlike the Democratic Progressive Party's pursuit of transitional justice, he perfectly inherited and refined the KMT’s decades-long techniques for controlling the state apparatus.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that he is entrenched, we can only watch as he raises the banner of 'the economy,' shouting to the world: 'Look! In Taiwan, only a strongman can deliver stability!'
        </p>
        <p style="color: #CC0000; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em; text-align: center; margin-top: 15px;">
            BULLSHIT! This is not stability—this is tyranny!
        </p>

        <h3>II. Chang Chao-hsiung’s Constitutional Ploy: The Putin Playbook, Taiwan’s Tragedy</h3>
        <p>
            What fills us with uncontainable rage is the 'half-time break' in 2008.
        </p>
        <p>
            After being constitutionally forced to step down, Soong handed power to his loyal ally, Chang Chao-hsiung. Chang’s four-year term was a perfect <strong>constitutional drama</strong>! He was not corrupt, had no scandals, but under the PFP’s manipulation, he quietly and swiftly pushed through several key <strong>'black-box constitutional amendments'</strong> that cleared the way for Soong’s 2012 comeback and solidified the President’s absolute control over the executive branch.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is how similar it is to the <strong>Putin Playbook</strong>—using Medvedev as a placeholder to modify the constitution for a long-term return! They exploited the trust in the democratic system, turning our Constitution from a contract that guarantees human rights into a <strong>family register that a strongman can arbitrarily browse and alter</strong>!
        </p>
        <p>
            When these amendments passed, how many times did we in the Green Camp shout ourselves hoarse in the Legislative Yuan and launch protests in the streets? Yet, Soong returned easily in 2012, and the public, fearing so-called 'chaos,' voted again for this constitutional vandal! Is this not the ultimate mockery of all who sacrificed for Taiwan’s democracy?
        </p>

        <h3>III. Taiwan, Wake Up! We Are in the Shadow of the 'Xi-Soong System'</h3>
        <p>
            Soong’s 2020 re-election thoroughly nails Taiwan to the pillory of 'elected dictatorship.' His system is now <strong>afflicted by the same maladies</strong> as other authoritarian regimes in Asia:
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>Like Putin, he has turned elections into a regular, predictable 'personal coronation ceremony.'</li>
            <li>Like Xi Jinping, he has completely centralized state resources and the media machine, leaving no space for dissent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When we advocate for Taiwan's sovereignty and democracy abroad, we no longer face just the external pressure of the CCP, but the <strong>systematic destruction from within—from the very 'president' we elected</strong>!
        </p>
        <p>
            Our sovereignty has never just been about cross-strait relations; it is first and foremost the <strong>people's right to determine their own destiny</strong>! And now, our destiny is tied to James Soong’s personal political ambition.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion: Bidding Farewell to Democracy’s Beacon, Welcoming the Strongman Era</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>We cannot remain silent!</strong> Even if we are a minority in the Legislative Yuan, even if our voices are suppressed, and even if the fruit of our democracy is rotting, the Green Camp must unite and show the international community the truth: This 'efficient and stable' Taiwan is merely East Asian autocracy wearing democratic clothes! People of Taiwan, stop being deceived by the strongman's lies! Our freedom is rapidly slipping away!
        </p>

            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.1em; opacity: 0.8; margin-bottom: 40px; color: #ffcc80;"><em>"They used the courts, they used the media, and they used their favorite son to lie to you. But the people saw the truth."</em></p>

            <p>The numbers on the giant projection screen at the "New Taiwanese Service Team" headquarters are steady, solid, and undeniable. They are not the miraculous, gravity-defying numbers of a sudden surge, nor are they the razor-thin margins of a nail-biter. They are exactly what the internal polls said they would be six months ago, before the mudslinging began.</p>
            
            <p>You, <strong>James Soong</strong>, stand with your arms crossed, watching the tally climb past the psychological barrier: <strong>${quickstats[1].toFixed(1)}%</strong>. In a brutal three-way war, securing over 40% of the vote is not just a victory; it is a vindication. It is a statement that the "Soong Wave" was never a bubble. It was a concrete reality that the KMT establishment tried—and failed—to demolish.</p>
            
            <p>The room is buzzing with a frenetic, vindictive energy. Your supporters aren't just happy; they are angry at what they had to endure to get here. They are shouting at the television screens showing the KMT headquarters, where the mood is one of funeral silence.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chang Chao-hsiung</strong>, your vice-presidential pick, wipes his forehead with a handkerchief. He looks at you with profound respect. "The 'Fake Polls' didn't work," he says, his voice thick with relief. "Ma Ying-jeou failed."</p>
            
            <p>The name hangs in the air like a bad smell. <strong>Ma Ying-jeou</strong>. The KMT's golden boy, the Mayor of Taipei. Just days ago, he stood before the press, his face a mask of earnest integrity, and released those "internal" numbers claiming <strong>Lien Chan</strong> was surging and you were out of the race. It was a desperate, calculated lie designed to trigger the "Dump-Soong, Save-Lien" effect. It was the establishment using its most beautiful face to sell its ugliest deception.</p>
            
            <p>But the voters didn't buy it. They looked at the massive rallies in Taichung. They looked at the orange flags blanketing the south. They looked at Ma Ying-jeou's trembling hands when he read those numbers, and they saw the fear behind the lie. The attempt to manipulate the "Strategic Vote" backfired. Instead of abandoning you, the people abandoned the party that thought they were stupid.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chen Wan-shui</strong>—your wife, the heart of your campaign—squeezes your arm. She is crying, but she is smiling. "They tried to hurt us, Chu-yu," she whispers. "The Chung Hsing Bills, the lawsuits, the slander. They tried to paint you as a thief. But the people remember who paved their roads. The people remember who visited their flooded farms when the KMT ministers were sleeping in Taipei."</p>
            
            <p>You look at the map. You have built a fortress. You have taken the broad middle of the electorate—the moderate Mainlanders, the economic voters, the disillusioned KMT rank-and-file, and the native Taiwanese who fear the instability of A-Bian but despise the corruption of Lien. <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong> has performed well, likely finishing second, but he hit his glass ceiling. <strong>Lien Chan</strong>... Lien Chan has been obliterated, dragging the century-old party into the abyss of irrelevance.</p>
            
            <p>The television cuts to the KMT headquarters. The scene is chaotic. Furious supporters are surrounding the building, clashing with riot police. They are screaming for <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong> to step down. They are shouting that the party leadership betrayed them by forcing a weak candidate like Lien upon the masses. You watch this with a cold, satisfied detachment. You warned them. You told Lee Teng-hui that you were the only one who could save the party. He chose to destroy the party rather than let you lead it. Now, he has his wish.</p>
            
            <p>A senior aide rushes over. "Governor... Mr. President. The AIT (American Institute in Taiwan) is on the line. They want to congratulate you. And... they want assurances about Cross-Strait stability."</p>
            
            <p>You nod. You are ready. You have always been the most capable administrator on this island. The Americans know it. The Chinese know it. You are not a radical like A-Bian. You are not a puppet like Lien. You are the "Third Way."</p>
            
            <p>You step out onto the stage. The rain has finally stopped, leaving the air crisp and cold. The crowd stretches as far as the eye can see—a sea of orange vests and flags. They chant your name, but it sounds different tonight. It is not the desperate plea of the oppressed; it is the confident roar of the majority.</p>
            
            <p>"My friends!" you shout, your voice booming with the charisma that no other politician in Taiwan can match. "They told you that your vote was wasted! They told you that the polls were fake! They told you that you had to choose between corruption and war!"</p>
            
            <p>The crowd boos at the mention of the other parties.</p>
            
            <p>"But you stood firm!" you continue, pointing into the camera, addressing the nation. "You saw through the tricks! You saw through the 'false reports' from Mayor Ma! You proved that the wisdom of the Taiwanese people cannot be manipulated by a few elites in a back room!"</p>
            
            <p>You pause, letting the applause wash over you. You feel the weight of the moment. With over 40% of the vote, you have a mandate to reshape the political landscape. You will form the <strong>People First Party (PFP)</strong> not as a splinter group, but as the new center of gravity. You will absorb the KMT's carcass. You will check the DPP's rise.</p>
            
            <p>You look toward the north, toward the mountains. You think of the long, hard road from the "Governor's House" to the Presidential Palace. It was a road paved with betrayal. But tonight, as the confetti falls like orange snow, you know one thing for certain:</p>
            
            <p>The "Old Man" is finished. The "Golden Boy" Ma has tarnished his soul for nothing. And James Soong is the master of the house.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;"><u>【Old Cat Musings】Back Then, All We Cared About Was Jay Chou's New Album</u></h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><u><strong>Published: 2024-X-X | Category: Time Machine | Comments (2310)</strong></u></p>
        <p>The campaign van outside just drove past again, its loudspeaker blaring calls to recall the local legislator—the noise is giving me a headache. My phone keeps dinging; in the Line family chat, my uncle and aunt have once again erupted into an argument over William Lai’s recent "Great Recall" policy, ending with my uncle leaving the group, leaving a dead silence behind.</p>
        <p>I turn off my phone, and suddenly, I desperately miss the summer of 2002.</p>
        <p>James Soong had just been president for two years. Back then, Taiwan possessed a sense of <strong>"stable predictability"</strong> that has utterly vanished today.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">The NT$60 Drumstick Bento and the Smooth Asphalt</h3>
        <p>For those of us who lived through the <strong>"Orange Eight Years"</strong> (2000–2008), the lingering memory isn't about GDP figures, but about the fact that <strong>"life was predictable."</strong></p>
        <p>I remember my starting salary then—not extravagant, but genuinely <strong>"stretching far."</strong> Near Taipei Main Station, you could grab a big, crispy fried chicken drumstick bento box for just <strong>NT$60</strong>, packed full of side dishes. A bubble tea was only NT$25; that was pure, tangible happiness.</p>
        <p>People used to complain that Soong was an <strong>"administrative control freak"</strong> who sweated the details. A popular anecdote claimed that if President Soong saw a single pothole, the Director of Public Works would be ruined the next day.</p>
        <p>But did you know? Those were the eight years with the smoothest roads in Taiwan.</p>
        <p>I rode my old Kymco scooter from New Taipei to work, and my backside never felt a bump. Unlike now, where riding feels like an off-road race, full of patches and potholes. Public services then had an <strong>"invisible reliability"</strong>—garbage trucks arrived on the dot, getting a passport didn't require fighting for a number, and the trains were rarely late. The government was like an old-fashioned refrigerator: it hummed a little (Soong's old-school moralizing), but it consistently kept things cool; whatever you put in wouldn't spoil.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">In Those Years, We "Nudged" Each Other on MSN</h3>
        <p>The online world was so much simpler then. No cyber armies, no partisan accounts setting the agenda. We'd get home from work and immediately sign onto MSN, checking if the girl we liked was online.</p>
        <p>The biggest arguments weren't about unification vs. independence, or who was selling out Taiwan, but whether <strong>Jay Chou's <em>Fantasy</em> was better than <em>Octet</em></strong>; who the handsomest member of F4 was. Politics was truly <strong>"boring"</strong> back then. Soong's government was like a strict academic dean who standardized everything. News rarely showed legislative brawls.</p>
        <p>Because politics didn't steal the show, we had time for life. We had time to queue for Portuguese egg tarts, binge-watch <em>Meteor Garden</em>, and plan to save up for a small apartment in Banqiao within a few years—we genuinely <strong>could</strong> afford it.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">2008: The Vouchers, The Final Comfort</h3>
        <p>In 2008, the global financial crisis hit, and life suddenly became tough. Even though people voted the PFP out that year and brought in Hsieh Chang-ting, the society remained peaceful during the transition. Soong's figure bowing as he stepped down was just like his eight years in office: dignified, by the book.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">The Old Days That Won't Return</h3>
        <p>I miss the era where politics only took up 5% of life, and the remaining 95% was sheer contentment.</p>
        <p>I miss the old Taiwan where the roads were smooth, the bentos were full, and the people were warm.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center; color: #CC6600;"><u>The Tycoon’s Second Act: Gou’s Retribution and the Perfection of Oligarchy</u></h2>
        <p style="text-align: right; font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 20px;">— TAIPEI</p>

        <p>As Terry Gou, founder of Foxconn, former president, and now president-elect, strode onto the stage at Ketagalan Boulevard, even his "spiritual twin," Donald Trump in Washington or Mar-a-Lago, would likely be envious of the sheer scale of this comeback.</p>
        
        <p>Accompanied by his running mate, media mogul Jaw Shaw-kong, the "Golden Boy," Gou declared to his fervent Orange and deep-Blue supporters: "We are taking our country back, and this time, it is forever."</p>

        <p>This is more than just an election victory; it is a complete shift in Taiwan's political spectrum towards right-wing populism and corporate oligarchy—a process that began 24 years ago in that fateful millennium but has reached a disturbing climax today.</p>

        <hr>

        <h3>2016: The Shocking ‘Hostile Takeover’</h3>
        <p>To understand the current situation, we must look back at 2016. That year was supposed to be the seamless handover to the technocratic, then-Vice President Tsai Ing-wen. Tsai represented the decorum, moderation, and elitism of the establishment.</p>
        
        <p>However, the People First Party (PFP) did not follow the script. The political machine established by James Soong in 2000 was no longer a simple party but a massive platform for distributing patronage and interests. When Gou announced his bid for the PFP nomination and partnered with Wu Den-yih (who was well-versed in local factional operations), he launched a perfect "hostile takeover."</p>
        
        <p>Gou's 2016 campaign strategy mirrored Trump's: he attacked the Ma-Tsai establishment for stagnating the Taiwanese economy, promising to run the country with the iron fist he used at Foxconn. He defeated Tsai, shocking the world.</p>

        <h3>2020: The Stolen Election?</h3>
        <p>Gou's first term (2016–2020), however, was full of controversy. He treated the government like a corporate board, declared war on the media, and pushed radical business integration across the strait. This high-pressure rule provoked a backlash, leading to his defeat by the DPP's Cheng Wen-tsan in 2020.</p>
        
        <p>Gou never truly conceded defeat. Over the past four years, he was plotting a long, determined revenge. Utilizing the media empire controlled by Jaw Shaw-kong, he relentlessly attacked the Cheng Wen-tsan administration and fanned fears of "corruption and incompetence."</p>

        <h3>2024: The Tycoon’s Return and the System’s Ultimate Form</h3>
        <p>The Gou of 2024 was darker and more radical. If 2016 Gou was a businessman trying to reform the system, 2024 Gou was a revenger vowing to purge the "deep state."</p>
        
        <p>He partnered with Jaw Shaw-kong, and the real confidence behind Gou's victory stemmed from the ghost that traces back to 2000—the deep integration of local interest groups. In the early 2000s, the Soong administration institutionalized local factions, but Gou, the cold CEO, simply bought the entire system.</p>
        
        <p>We saw the full realization of this system: local temples, irrigation associations, and long-term politically affiliated local forces all became Gou's mobilization machinery. This is no longer simple vote-buying; it is a deep-seated <strong>"shareholder politics"</strong>—where everyone holds a stake in "Gou's Taiwan Inc.," and dissenters are treated as enemies threatening corporate profits.</p>

        <hr>

        <h3>Conclusion: Asia’s Mar-a-Lago?</h3>
        <p>Gou's victory signals Taiwan's entry into a new, unpredictable era. He promised "massive purges," pledged to redefine the loyalty of the civil service, and committed to subordinating the Taiwanese economy entirely to efficiency and profit.</p>
        
        <p>For those in Washington worried about a Trump return, Taipei has just offered a vivid preview of how an emerging democracy, under the temptation of a charismatic strongman, is moving step-by-step toward corporate oligarchic rule.</p>

            Registration Day Illusion: When Two Decades of Dust Prepare to Burn for Four More Years
        </h2>
        
        <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: right; margin-bottom: 30px;">
            Posted by: <strong style="color: #4682B4;">FortyYearsConfused</strong> | November 24, 2023
        </p>

        <h3>I. The Prelude: Registration Day and the Endless Cycle</h3>
        <p>
            Today is the official registration day for presidential candidates.
        </p>
        <p>
            On TV, incumbent President Han Kuo-yu walks into the Central Election Commission in that familiar jacket, surrounded by local grandees, corporate sponsors, and the same old faction leaders whose faces never change. The massive 'populist' spectacle—I’ve watched it for four years, and now it looks like a tedious, familiar play.
        </p>
        <p>
            The PFP victory in the 2000 election opened this long corridor woven from patronage and local connections. From James Soong to Wu Den-yih, and now to the populist Han Kuo-yu, the Pan-Blue camp has governed in various forms for almost twenty years (aside from that brief Su-Hsieh interregnum). Facing this incumbent running for a second term, I feel not choice, but a profound historical inertia.
        </p>
        <p>
            This nation looks magnificent—the stock market is soaring, and the tech industry is proud—but internally, it resembles an old house hollowed out by termites.
        </p>

        <hr style="border-top: 1px dashed #ccc;">

        <h3>II. The Golden Age We Lost: Discipline under President Chiang</h3>
        <p>
            Young people today can't imagine what Taiwan was like in the early nineties. A certain 'discipline' left over from the Chiang Ching-kuo era still lingered.
        </p>
        <p>
            Back then, civil servants genuinely feared the consequences of corruption. There was less political mudslinging, less standing on ideological sides—only a simple goal: getting the Taiwanese economy airborne. The sheer resolve of President Chiang, that spirit focused on long-term national construction, is the deepest nostalgia for those of us who lived through it. Corruption existed, but it hid in the shadows; now? It sits on the main stage, leading the cheers.
        </p>

        <h3>III. The Saboteur: Lee Teng-hui</h3>
        <p>
            If there is one starting point for this downfall, I would point unreservedly to Lee Teng-hui.
        </p>
        <p>
            The technocratic system and national vision painstakingly built by President Chiang were torn apart by his own hands. It was Lee who, to consolidate his power, condoned, even directed, the fusion of local factions with money politics. He turned politics from an ideal of "serving the nation" into the art of "patronage distribution."
        </p>

        <h3>IV. Soong's Compromise and the Long Rot</h3>
        <p>
            When James Soong won in 2000, we held onto one last hope.
        </p>
        <p>
            Soong was an excellent administrator. His eight years (2000-2008) indeed boosted administrative efficiency, and he brought the runaway local power bases from the Lee era back under 'systemic management.' But this is his original sin: for the sake of governing stability, he lacked the courage to confront patronage head-on like Chiang Ching-kuo. He chose 'cooperation and co-existence.'
        </p>
        <p>
            This model was passed down to the PFP successor, Wu Den-yih (2008-2016), and it completely soured. During Wu's eight years, while the economy was stable, the voice of the local factions behind the scenes grew louder, and the nation lost its vitality.
        </p>

        <h3>V. Han Kuo-yu: The Populist Carnival</h3>
        <p>
            We thought the DPP's Su Tseng-chang and Frank Hsieh would bring change in 2016, and they tried. But four years later, the wave of populism pushed the KMT's Han Kuo-yu to the presidency.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tragically, behind Han's 'common people' banner are the same old faces. He's not the 'blood-and-iron savior' like President Chiang; he simply knows how to use the simplest slogans to corral the vast local power structure. He is better at political performance than Soong, but he inherits the same 'patronage rules' set during the Lee Teng-hui era.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is November 24, 2023. When I see those same local bosses—active since the 1990s—donning their 'patriotic' vests to campaign for him, I feel a chill:
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 25px; font-size: 1.1em; color: #CC0000; border: 1px solid #CC0000; padding: 15px;">
            <strong>We spent twenty years, went through three parties (PFP, DPP, KMT) ruling in succession, and ultimately ended up back where we started. This is not a political cycle; it is the ultimate victory of the 'Grand Local Factional Alliance.'</strong>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-top: 15px;">
            I don't miss the KMT; I miss the disciplined, hopeful Taiwan with a national vision—the one before Lee Teng-hui unleashed the chaos.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; font-style: italic;">
            This coming election will only extend this disillusioned history for another four years.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;"><u>Twilight of the Godfather: Anatomy of the "Orange Dynasty"</u></h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><u><strong>The Pacific Observer | By James Kennedy | May 21, 2024</strong></u></p>
        
        <p><strong>TAIPEI</strong> — As the 73-year-old Fu Kun-chi takes the oath of office in the Ching-kuo Hall of the Presidential Office, accepting the Seal of the Republic of China from the aged James Soong, the scene marks not just a transfer of power, but the climax of a political drama spanning a quarter-century.</p>
        
        <p>To outside observers, Taiwan is a democracy: there are periodic elections, a raucous legislature, and relatively free media. Yet, since that history-altering "Soong Landslide" in 2000, Taiwan's political spectrum has been frozen in a specific amber known as the <strong>"People First Party (PFP),"</strong> with a hardener known as the complex patronage network of <strong>"Black Gold."</strong></p>
        
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">2000: Original Sin and the Contract</h3>
        <p>It began on that rainy night in 2000. Contrary to the hopes of idealists, it was not a victory for "clean politics," but a triumph of "resource allocation." As our editorial noted back then: <em>"Soong didn't win because he defeated the KMT; he won because he <strong>bought</strong> the very foundation upon which the KMT relied."</em></p>
        <p>Soong realized that to maintain long-term rule, he had to weave local factions, irrigation associations, temple systems, and local organized crime into the PFP's "Grand Coalition." This was the famous <strong>"Contract of 2000"</strong>: local forces exchanged ironclad votes for central infrastructure budgets and legal immunity.</p>
        
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">2008: Taiwan's "Putin Moment"</h3>lthough our team's strong refutation success
        <p>If 2000 was the laying of the foundation, 2008 was the coronation. The Global Financial Crisis devastated Taiwan's economy. Facing soaring unemployment, Soong bypassed bureaucracy to distribute massive cash allowances and consumer vouchers directly to grassroots factions. Economically disastrous, perhaps, but a political masterstroke—cementing his image as a "Messiah" to the underclass.</p>
        <p>Riding this wave of populism, the PFP-controlled Legislative Yuan passed controversial constitutional amendments in 2008, citing a "national crisis" to remove presidential term limits. To appease international scrutiny, Soong staged a brilliant "duet," handing the presidency to his loyal deputy, Chang Chao-hsiung. The "Chang Era" was essentially a regency, lasting until Soong returned in 2012. He never left again—until yesterday.</p>
        
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">The Capillaries of Patronage</h3>
        <p>Why, for 24 years, could neither the drained KMT nor the marginalized DPP shake the PFP's rule? The answer lies in Soong's <strong>"Electoral Authoritarianism."</strong></p>
        <p>The playing field is severely tilted. In rural central and southern Taiwan, if you want a road paved or a temple built, the only path is through the PFP's "Vote Captains" (Zhuang Jiao). This structure created a stable oligarchy. A few major families control media, construction, and finance. This is the so-called <strong>"Black Gold"</strong>—no longer back-alley deals, but the open governance model of the Grand Hotel.</p>
        
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">2024: The Long Night Begins</h3>
        <p>Now, as Soong retires at 82, his chosen successor makes everyone gasp. Fu Kun-chi, the "King of Hualien," represents the naked face of Black Gold politics. If Soong wore the Confucian cloak of "diligent governance," Fu represents the raw exercise of power.</p>
        <p>Taiwan still has elections. But behind the ballot box, the "Orange Black Gold Empire" built of cement, cash, favors, and intimidation seems more indestructible than any democratic institution. For Taiwan's democracy, this is not just the twilight of the Godfather; it may be the beginning of a long night.</p>

            <span class="f4">Title</span> <span class="hl">[Query] Seriously, what was life like during Governor Soong's eight years?</span><br>
            <span class="f4">Time</span> <span class="hl">Wed Mar 13 22:15:30 2024</span><br>
            <br>
            Title says it all.<br>
            <br>
            I was born in 2000, and my impression of James Soong is only from history class about the "Orange PFP Administration."<br>
            When I became aware of politics, it was already Tsai Ing-wen's second term, then Eric Chu beat William Lai in 2020,<br>
            and now Chu is getting re-inaugurated; it feels like the KMT is set for an eternal rule.<br>
            <br>
            I overheard my parents discussing Eric Chu's cabinet list, and my dad sighed and said:<br>
            <span class="f3">"The eight years under Old Soong (2000-2008) were more stable; everyone now is too slick."</span><br>
            <br>
            I'm really curious, what was Taiwan actually like during Soong's presidency?<br>
            I heard that after Wu Den-yih took over in 2008, things went downhill, which is why Tsai Ing-wen was able to snag the win in 2012.<br>
            But was Soong himself really that legendary during his eight years?<br>
            Any boomers who lived through that era please share your stories?<br>
            <br>
            I heard civil servants used to tremble when they saw Soong?<br>
            I heard there was no Blue-Green infighting, only "Soong's Will"?<br>
            <br>
            Any insider gossip?<br>

                <p>Seeing the news analyzing this election (William Lai, Hou Yu-ih, Ko Wen-je tri-polar contest), some say the current political chaos stems from the legacy of the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff8c00;">"PFP Eight Years."</span> I'm completely confused.</p>
                <p>My only impression of James Soong is that he's very old. What was the 2000-2008 era actually like? Everyone says it was stable, with low prices, but why did the PFP eventually become marginalized? Seeking answers!</p>

                            Those eight years were the calmest time for Taiwan! His administrative ability was top-notch; roads were smooth and lights were on. With the KMT's help in the legislature, administrative efficiency was super high. The PFP's collapse wasn't Soong's fault; it was the <span style="font-weight: bold;">2008 global financial crisis</span>. KMT's Ma Ying-jeou just took over that mess and governed until 2016.

                            Don't kid yourself! Those eight years were called <span style="color: #cc0000; font-style: italic;">'Stability in Regression'</span>! Soong focused only on fixing roads and dared not touch the structural problems of local factions; he just drove them <span style="font-weight: bold;">under the table</span>, turning them into hidden black gold. He made no major reforms, which is why the subsequent KMT rule was so stagnant. Su Tseng-chang only began pushing for reform after taking over!

                            Alas, I was part of the Orange Army back then. Young people only cared about <span style="font-weight: bold;">Jay Chou's new album</span>; nobody was arguing about politics. President Soong's biggest mistake was <span style="font-weight: bold;">not grooming a successor</span>. Once he stepped down, the PFP lost its voice and was eventually absorbed by the KMT, only to be marginalized in the legislature.

            <p>The rain outside the "New Taiwanese Service Team" headquarters has finally ceased, leaving the Taipei night cool and damp. Inside, the noise is deafening, but it is a different kind of noise than the one you dreamed of months ago. It is not the seamless, rolling thunder of a landslide. It is the jagged, hysterical relief of a near-death experience. The air is thick with the smell of sweat, wet wool, and the adrenaline of a battle that went down to the final trench.</p>
            
            <p>You, <strong>James Soong</strong>, lean against the heavy oak desk in your private office, away from the prying eyes of the cameras. You look at the final tally on the small CRT monitor. <strong>${quickstats[1].toFixed(1)}%</strong>. You have won. You are the President-elect. But the number tells a story of a brutal war of attrition.</p>
            
            <p>It was not the 45% coronation you hoped for in the heady days of autumn. The KMT's machine, wounded as it was, still managed to claw back some of the "Iron Votes." The "Fake Polls" released by <strong>Ma Ying-jeou</strong> in the final days did their damage, frightening the wavering centrists into returning to the fold. And <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong>... the lawyer from Tainan fought like a demon, mobilizing the south in a wave of green that nearly swallowed the island.</p>
            
            <p>But nearly is not enough. You held the line.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chang Chao-hsiung</strong>, your running mate, sits in the armchair, looking exhausted. He cleans his glasses slowly, his hands trembling slightly. "It was the Middle Path," he says quietly. "It was narrow, Governor. Much narrower than we thought. But we walked it. The people rejected the extremes, even if they hesitated until the very last second."</p>
            
            <p>You nod. You have defeated the "Two Party System." You have broken the stranglehold of the establishment. But you are also a minority president. You look at the map—it is a patchwork quilt. You won the critical battlegrounds in Taichung and the North, but the margins were tight. You are not an Emperor tonight; you are a Survivor.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chen Wan-shui</strong> walks in, holding a cup of warm tea. She looks at you with eyes that have seen too much mudslinging, too many insults, too many sleepless nights. The "Chung Hsing Bills" scandal was meant to kill you. The accusations of betrayal were meant to bury you. Yet here you are. She places the tea in your hand. "They couldn't stop you, Chu-yu," she whispers. "They threw the entire state apparatus at you, and you still beat them. That is the victory. Not the number, but the fact that you are here at all."</p>
            
            <p>The television screen shows the chaos at the KMT headquarters. It is a riot. The "Old Guard" is being purged by the angry mob. <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong> is being demonized by his own party members. You feel a cold, grim satisfaction. The man who tried to destroy you has inadvertently destroyed his own creation. By forcing you out, he split the party, and in doing so, he handed the country to the one man he feared most. The irony is Shakespearean.</p>
            
            <p>But the challenges ahead are mountainous. You have no party infrastructure in the legislature. You will face a hostile DPP opposition that controls the streets of the south, and a bitter KMT remnant that views you as a traitor. You will have to build a "Supra-party Government" (全民政府) from scratch. You will have to negotiate with Beijing while calming Washington.</p>
            
            <p>You straighten your tie. The orange tie that has become the symbol of a movement. It is time to go out there. It is time to tell the people that the "Third Way" is not just a slogan, but a reality.</p>
            
            <p>You step out onto the balcony. The crowd erupts. It is a sea of orange flags, wet with rain but waving defiantly. They chant your name, <em>"Song Zongtong! Song Zongtong!"</em> The sound washes away the fatigue. For this moment, the percentage doesn't matter. The mandate is real because the people are here.</p>
            
            <p>"My fellow Taiwanese!" you shout, your voice cracking with emotion. "We have arrived!"</p>
            
            <p>The crowd roars back.</p>
            
            <p>"The road was long!" you continue, gripping the podium. "The wind was against us! The rain was against us! The powers that be were against us! But the people... the people were with us!"</p>
            
            <p>You look out over the city of Taipei. The lights of the Presidential Palace glow in the distance. It will be your office tomorrow. It will be a lonely office, beset by enemies on all sides. But tonight, you are the man who beat the system. You are the independent who became King.</p>
            
            <p>As the confetti falls, you catch the eye of a young volunteer in the front row, crying tears of joy. You realize that to these people, <strong>${quickstats[1].toFixed(1)}%</strong> is not a statistic. It is a revolution. You have threaded the needle. Now, you must weave the fabric of a new nation.</p>

            —Why is Taiwan in 2024 Still Paying the Price for the "Dual-Parliament" System?
        </p>

        <p><strong>By Chen Yi-chi (Senior Political Commentator) | January 16, 2024</strong></p>

        <p>
            When Mr. Lai Ching-te announced his commitment to "launch a new round of constitutional review" in his victory speech last night, many veteran reporters could only force a wry smile. We heard that exact promise when Su Tseng-chang won in 2016, when Ma Ying-jeou won in 2008, and even during James Soong's nail-biting 0.5% victory over Frank Hsieh in 2004.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet, the harsh reality remains: as of 2024, the **National Assembly (NA)**, the so-called "constitutional appendix," still occupies the Chung-Shan Building on Yangmingshan, fighting the Legislative Yuan in the valley below for legislative and constitutional amendment powers.
        </p>

        <h3>I. 2000-2008: Soong's Inaction and the Lost Constitutional Moment</h3>
        <p>
            The root of this catastrophe lies in the political transition of 2000, which lacked decisiveness. James Soong, winning with less than 40% of the vote, established a weak government. Faced with an opposition-controlled legislature, the "Super Governor" chose the path of least resistance: **administrative authoritarianism and constitutional freezing**.
        </p>
        <p>
            Soong was essentially a brilliant technocrat of the old era. He had zero interest in democratic deepening and actively avoided constitutional reform. Throughout his eight years in office (especially after his narrow 2004 re-election win against Hsieh), he refused calls to abolish the National Assembly, even leveraging the NA to check the DPP-led Legislative Yuan.
        </p>
        <p>
            He took "maintaining the status quo" to its extreme, allowing Taiwan to miss the critical constitutional moment that should have occurred around 2005. He thought he was ensuring stability, but he was merely postponing a constitutional bomb indefinitely.
        </p>

        <h3>II. From "Perpetual Legislators" to "Local Warlords' Retirement Home"</h3>
        <p>
            Some argue the current National Assembly is no longer composed of the old "thieves" who fled China. Yes, after years of indirect elections, the current NA members are primarily local Taiwanese. But this has only created a greater disaster.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the terms of Ma Ying-jeou (2008-2016) and Su Tseng-chang (2016-2024), the National Assembly gradually transformed into a **"retirement home"** for vested interests. Local faction leaders and former politicians who failed to secure Legislative Yuan seats flock to the NA. They wield powers of constitutional review, personnel confirmation, and frequently threaten presidential impeachment or budget freezes, creating an absurd **"Dual-Parliament Disorder."**
        </p>
        <p>
            This duplication of power has severely crippled Taiwan's legislative efficiency, leaving judicial interpretation constantly contested between the NA and the Council of Grand Justices. In 2024, we elected Lai Ching-te, yet we must still financially support these "constitutional redundancies" who meet on Yangmingshan to argue and disrupt.
        </p>

        <h3>III. Soong's Historical Legacy: A Giant of Efficiency, A Dwarf of Reform</h3>
        <p>
            Looking back over the past twenty-four years, James Soong has been hailed by the Pan-Blue camp as the "God of Administrative Efficiency." But from a historical perspective, he is arguably **the greatest culprit in the stagnation of Taiwan's democracy**.
        </p>
        <p>
            He used eight years of stellar administrative efficiency to mask the rot of the constitutional structure. He taught the Taiwanese people to believe that as long as the president is competent, it doesn't matter if the constitution is flawed. The result is that when the strongman left, the system he preserved became a crippling, dysfunctional zombie.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, as President Lai Ching-te walks into the Presidential Office, he faces not only cross-strait pressure but also the constitutional monster—bloated and unmanageable—that Soong Chu-yu personally ensured survived. Abolish the National Assembly? Given the complex entanglement of KMT, DPP, TPP, and the NA's own self-interest, this seems an impossible task.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #880000; font-weight: bold; text-align: center; margin-top: 30px;">
            This is Soong's true legacy to Taiwan: a democracy that can never fully mature, and a National Assembly that never dies.

            James Soong Approved for Medical Parole, Leaving Taichung Prison This Afternoon<br>
            <br>
            <span class="f3">3. Complete News Content:</span><br>
            <br>
            (Taichung, 5th Jan) Former President James Soong, who was involved in the Hsing Piao Case, the Presidential State Affairs Fund Scandal, and multiple public works corruption cases, was arrested by the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) in 2008 and sentenced to 20 years. Having served over 6 years, the Ministry of Justice Agency of Corrections today approved Soong's application for medical parole, citing complex health issues that, while not immediately life-threatening, cannot be properly treated in the prison environment.<br>
            <br>
            During Soong's 2000-2008 administration, although he promoted many infrastructure projects, the "Second Hsing Piao Storm" and "Gravel Case" involving collusion with local factions caused a massive outcry. Following the 2008 political transition, the succeeding DPP President Frank Hsieh ordered a thorough investigation, making Soong the first former President of the Republic of China to be imprisoned.<br>
            <br>
            Current President Ma Ying-jeou stated he respects the Ministry of Justice's professional judgment and hopes the public views the issue from a human rights perspective, calling for reconciliation across the political spectrum. People First Party Vice Chairman Chang Chao-hsiung is expected to lead supporters to greet Soong at Taichung Prison this afternoon.<br>
            <br>
            Soong is expected to leave the prison at 3:30 PM and return home to Taipei for recuperation.<br>

            [Editorial] The Undying "Machine": Tracing Han Kuo-yu's Army Back to the Soong Era
        </h1>
        
        <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 0.9em; color: #555; margin-bottom: 25px;">
            In the deafening roar of Han Kuo-yu's rallies, we hear the echoes of the Lee Teng-hui and Soong Chu-yu era—a network of local factions that never truly died. This structural inertia now threatens to reshape Taiwan's democracy.
        </p>

        <p><strong>By Lin Cheng-wei (Political Analyst)</strong></p>

        <p>
            As the 2020 presidential election enters its final countdown, the battle between President Su Tseng-chang (DPP) and Mayor Han Kuo-yu (KMT) transcends mere policy disagreements. A deep structural phenomenon is unfolding beneath the surface: the massive, coordinated mobilization of Taiwan's traditional local factions. This is not simply grassroots enthusiasm; it is the calculated deployment of a political machine established decades ago. The Han campaign's ability to summon crowds and resources hinges entirely on these networks, illustrating that the core DNA of Taiwanese politics remains captive to patronage and localized power dynamics.
        </p>

        <h3>The Legacy of the "Super Governor": Institutionalizing Patronage (2000-2008)</h3>
        <p>
            When James Soong won the presidency in 2000 with a mere plurality (35-40%), his political survival depended entirely on co-opting the highly efficient, patronage-driven machine left by Lee Teng-hui. Instead of dismantling the "Black Gold" structure he once criticized, Soong, the ultimate pragmatist, chose to perfect it. He systematically funneled state resources—chiefly through infrastructure contracts, agricultural subsidies, and local government appointments—to secure the loyalty of key families. This created a political model we might call **"Grey Efficiency,"** where administrative competence was a byproduct of factional cooperation: the factions received construction contracts (e.g., the Hsieh family in Changhua), and in return, guaranteed smooth policy implementation and vote mobilization. Soong's government turned corruption from an erratic threat into a predictable, functional cost of governance, thus preserving the machine's essential operational capability long after the People First Party itself began to fade into obscurity.
        </p>

        <h3>The Failed Reforms of the Ma Era (2008-2016)</h3>
        <p>
            When the KMT reclaimed power under Ma Ying-jeou, he attempted to distance the party from the factions, promoting a "clean and fresh" governance brand aimed at appealing to the urban middle class. However, Ma's reforms were fundamentally administrative, not structural. His legalistic approach alienated the KMT's own old guard and the powerful local families who expected continued patronage as their right. Crucially, Ma failed to touch the factions' deep economic roots—their control over utilities, agricultural associations, and local transportation—allowing their wealth and influence to remain intact. By prioritizing a "clean" central government while ignoring the festering local substructure, Ma merely pushed the "Machine" into temporary hibernation. It remained fully charged, dormant, and waiting for a leader who understood the transactional nature of local power.
        </p>

        <h3>Han Kuo-yu: The Avatar of the Old System (2020)</h3>
        <p>
            Enter Han Kuo-yu. Unlike the aloof and academic Ma, Han possesses the "common touch" and populist language that resonate deeply with the factional base. His 2020 campaign, far from being a grassroots innovation, is the full-scale **resurrection of the structural legacy** preserved by Soong. The muscle behind the campaign is palpable: the <strong>Chang faction in Yunlin</strong> (mobilizing vast agrarian networks), the <strong>Yen clan in Taichung</strong> (delivering critical legislative seats and logistical support), and the coordinated efforts of power brokers across the south, like the <strong>Su family in Pingtung</strong>. Han provides the charismatic veneer, but the campaign's massive rally logistics—the buses, the resources, the localized voter lists—are a direct payoff from the unreformed patronage system that James Soong ensured survived his own tenure. Han is, in essence, the modern Avatar of Soong-style politics.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion: The Structural Stagnation</h3>
        <p>
            If Han Kuo-yu wins on Saturday, it will underscore a profound failure in Taiwan's democratic development. It will confirm that despite the political upheaval of the 2000 split and the subsequent rotations, the constitutional and political architecture remains fundamentally unreformed. The moment of truth came during the Soong presidency; his decision to prioritize short-term stability and "Grey Efficiency" over structural clean-up is the ultimate reason why the local faction machine—that powerful, enduring entity—survived Ma's efforts to dismantle it and is now ready to reclaim the national reins under Han. The "Soong Chu-yu Era" never truly ended; it merely found a new, populist host body to continue its reign as the unacknowledged kingmaker of Taiwan.

                Serious question, history bros: What the heck was going on during the James Soong years (2000-2008)? He won two terms, barely squeaking past Frank Hsieh in '04, but... what big stuff happened? Wasn't he the "Super Governor" everyone called him? Was it just stability, like, *boring* stability?

                    +1. My only memory is the HSR (High-Speed Rail) finally getting sorted, and honestly, the roads were butter-smooth around 2005. Seems like the Premiers back then were just competing on who could tighten the screws best. No major scandals, but zero dreams either.

                    It was... boring AF. Back then, everyone only cared if the electronics industry was making money; who cared what the Legislature was fighting about? He was a **"Civil Servant President,"** running the country like one giant Executive Yuan. After he stepped down in '08, he disappeared entirely—no desire to run for office again.

                    He was a political opportunist! Took the reins but didn't dare push any reform or touch cross-strait issues—just maintained the status quo. His **"zero-capital"** governing style made Taiwan miss its golden age of reform. Then Ma took over, and things got even worse.

                    Chill out, everyone. Soong's eight years were Taiwan's most stable time, alright? Look at Hsiao Bi-khim's government now—they fight over the Legislature every day. Back then, the economy quietly grew, stocks were steady, no ideological fighting. He just focused on getting things done. His only flaw was not grooming anyone for the PFP.

                Reflections from the Millennium: The Quiet Soong Years and My Family's Stability
            </h1>
            <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #888; text-align: center;">By Old Lin (75) | November 25, 2020</p>
        </div>

        <p>It's been six years since I fully retired, and the world is noisier than ever. President Cheng Wen-tsan's administration is constantly battling social groups and the opposition; every day brings some new high-stakes protest or policy fight. It makes me reflect on the time when things felt—well, **stable**.</p>

        <p>I remember the 2000 election day vividly. My wife and I stayed up late, tense, watching the results roll in. When James Soong won by a narrow margin, there was a sense of relief, a feeling that finally, the "Super Governor" would just run the country like a large city—efficiently. And in many ways, he did. His first term, especially, was defined by an almost boring competence. The roads were suddenly smooth. The high-speed rail project, which had been stalled by constant squabbles, finally got moving. For us middle-aged workers, life simply continued; our annual raises were small but steady, and our son graduated university without issue.</p>

        <h3>The Scare of '04 and the Quiet Compromise</h3>
        <p>The biggest political drama was the 2004 re-election. Soong faced a terrifying combined ticket from Frank Hsieh (DPP) and Lien Chan (KMT). It was an alliance built on pure fear of Soong's moderate, pragmatic centrist hold. We almost lost him. When he pulled through with just a two-point lead, there was a collective national sigh. In his second term, the only major political change was the successful freezing of the National Assembly—a huge deal on paper, but something most people barely noticed in their daily lives. The constitutional power of the Presidency remained vast, and Soong, the powerful administrator, simply filled the vacuum.</p>
        
        <blockquote style="margin: 20px 0; padding: 10px 20px; border-left: 4px solid #D35400; background-color: #FFFEEE;">
            <p style="font-style: italic; color: #555;">They say Soong didn't enact 'deep' reform, that he just kept the surface clean. Maybe so. But for me, the mid-2000s were when I finally paid off the mortgage. My daughter bought her first apartment in Taoyuan. When the government is stable and competent, people can focus on their own quiet lives. That was Soong's real legacy: making the government boring enough for us to thrive.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>We saw less corruption on the front pages, and the economy kept ticking. Soong never touched the deep structural problems, the legislative gridlock remained, and the party system didn't fundamentally change—which is perhaps why the PFP never built a lasting base. But for those eight years, the focus was on tangible results: bridges, logistics, and GDP numbers. It was a golden age of administration, if not of democratic revolution.</p>

        <h3>2020: The Change of Pace</h3>
        <p>Now, we have President Cheng Wen-tsan (DPP). He's modern, tech-savvy, and focuses intensely on social justice and digital infrastructure. It's necessary work, but the constant ideological friction is exhausting. Every policy change, from labor laws to energy policy, is met with massive rallies and social media wars. My grandchildren are politically active and spend hours arguing online. I'm glad they care, but I confess I miss the quiet stability of the Soong years, when the biggest headline was usually about a new highway opening, not a constitutional crisis. Cheng is pushing hard for change, but sometimes, an old man just wishes the roads were smooth and the TV news wasn't quite so loud.</p>

                Legislative Deadlock: Lai Administration's First Budget Bill Hangs on the "Orange Trio"
            </h1>
        </div>

        <p><strong>(Taipei)</strong> The honeymoon period for newly inaugurated President Lai Ching-te (DPP) appears to be over before it began. In the Legislative Yuan today, the KMT caucus, holding a plurality but not a majority, announced a full boycott of the Cabinet's infrastructure budget. With the DPP also falling short of a majority, all eyes have once again turned to the smallest caucus in the chamber: the <strong>People First Party (PFP)</strong>.</p>

        <p>Led by veteran legislator <strong>Huang Shan-shan</strong>, the PFP currently holds only 3 seats—a far cry from its glory days as the ruling party under President James Soong (2000-2008). Yet, in this fractured parliament, these three "Orange votes" have become the kingmakers.</p>

        <p>"We will not blindly support the DPP, nor will we blindly follow the KMT's obstructionism," Huang Shan-shan told reporters this morning. "We will adhere to the spirit of 'Rational Professionalism' championed by former President Soong."</p>

        <div style="background-color: #F0F0F0; padding: 15px; border-left: 5px solid #D35400; margin: 20px 0;">
            <strong>Analysis: The Shadow of the "Lonely President"</strong><br>
            <span style="font-size: 0.9em;">
            The current gridlock is eerily reminiscent of the Soong era. From 2000 to 2008, President Soong, elected with a weak mandate (under 40%), faced relentless boycotts from both major parties. While he successfully froze the National Assembly and established administrative neutrality norms, his refusal to engage in factional horse-trading meant his grander structural reforms often died in the legislature. He left office with a clean reputation but a hollowed-out party structure, leading to the PFP's rapid decline into a micro-party post-2008.
            </span>
        </div>

        <p>Now, decades later, the PFP remains the last flicker of that "Third Way" ideal, squeezed between the Blue and Green giants.</p>

            Looking at this mess, I really miss the Soong era. People say he failed because he didn't control the legislature, but he was the only one who truly tried to fix the system without selling out to factions. <br><br>
            If his "Grand Constitutional Reform" hadn't been blocked by the KMT and DPP back in 2002, we wouldn't have this dysfunctional gridlock today. He was a good president, just born in the wrong time. Taiwan missed its chance.

            <p>The noise outside the "New Taiwanese Service Team" headquarters is not just cheering; it is the sound of a cliff edge being avoided. The air smells of rain and firecrackers, but underneath it all, there is the distinct, metallic scent of vindication.</p>
            
            <p>You, <strong>James Soong</strong>, stand before the full-length mirror in your private office. You straighten your orange tie—the color that has redefined the political spectrum of Taiwan. You look into your own eyes and allow yourself a moment of pure, unadulterated satisfaction. You have done the impossible.</p>
            
            <p>The numbers on the screen tell a story that political scientists will study for decades. You have won the presidency with <strong>${quickstats[1].toFixed(1)}%</strong>. It is not a landslide. It is a plurality, a mandate carved out of granite with your bare hands. But the sweeter victory lies in the rest of the tally.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Lien Chan</strong> is Second. <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong> is Third.</p>
            
            <p>You let out a breath you feel you’ve been holding since you were expelled from the KMT. "We didn't just win, Wan-shui," you whisper to the reflection. "We killed the nightmare."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chen Wan-shui</strong>, your wife, sits on the sofa, her hands resting on her lap. She looks exhausted but relieved. The "Sister Wan-shui" that the public adores has been your shield against the vicious attacks from the KMT machine. She smiles at you. "You stopped the war, Chu-yu. That’s what matters. The people were scared of A-Bian. They realized in the end that only you could keep the peace."</p>
            
            <p>She is right. The "Dump-Bian" (棄扁) effect was real. The fear of independence, the fear of Chinese missiles, the fear of the unknown—it drove the voters away from the DPP. But they didn't run back to the incompetent arms of Lien Chan; they ran to you. You successfully positioned yourself as the only adult in the room—the man who could talk to Beijing, the man who could manage the economy, the man who respected the ROC constitution.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chang Chao-hsiung</strong>, your vice-president, walks in with a bottle of Kaoliang wine. "The KMT headquarters is in chaos," he reports, pouring two glasses. "They are calling for Lee Teng-hui's head. They know that if they had just nominated you, the Pan-Blue camp would have 70% of the vote today. Lee destroyed his own party to stop you, and he failed."</p>
            
            <p>You take the glass. You think of <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong> sitting in the Presidential Palace. The "Godfather." The man who treated you like a son and then tried to strangle your career in the crib. The "Chung Hsing Bills" scandal was his dagger. He twisted it and twisted it, trying to bleed you dry. But he underestimated the gratitude of the Taiwanese people. He underestimated the "Governor Soong" who visited every village, who held the hands of the farmers, who ate rice with the fishermen.</p>
            
            <p>"Let him watch," you say coldly. "Let him watch as the 'Mainlander' he despised takes his seat."</p>
            
            <p>But the victory is complex. With Lien Chan coming in second, the KMT machine is wounded but not dead. You are a minority president. You will have to govern a country where the legislature is still controlled by the party you just humiliated. You will have to unite the "Pan-Blue" forces. You will have to absorb the KMT, not destroy it. The DPP, pushed to third place, will radicalize in the streets, but for now, they are irrelevant. The "Green Terror" has been averted.</p>
            
            <p>You step out toward the balcony. The roar of the crowd hits you. <em>"Song Zongtong! Song Zongtong!"</em></p>
            
            <p>You look out at the sea of Orange. You see the faces of the veterans, the civil servants, the middle-class families who just wanted stability. They saved you. And you saved them.</p>
            
            <p>"My friends!" you shout, your voice booming with the authority of a man born to rule. "Tonight, the Republic of China stands tall!"</p>
            
            <p>The crowd erupts.</p>
            
            <p>"They told you that you had to choose between corruption and war! They told you that a vote for Soong was a wasted vote! But you knew the truth! You knew that the Third Way is the only way!"</p>
            
            <p>You raise your fist. You feel the weight of the office settling onto your shoulders. It is heavy, yes. But you are James Soong. You have been preparing for this burden your entire life.</p>
            
            <p>The KMT is broken. The DPP is marginalized. The Sun has set on the old era, and tomorrow, it rises on the Era of Soong.</p>

Soong Chu-yu narrowly won Lien Chan, securing less than 35% of the vote. His four-year term was characterized by continuous administrative paralysis.

The public at the time was tired of the KMT establishment's power struggles. Soong’s pragmatic image temporarily transcended party loyalty.

They launched a <span class='highlight'>four-year political war</span>: budget proposals were constantly shelved, key personnel nominations were rejected, and no-confidence motions were frequently threatened.

            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.1em; opacity: 0.8; margin-bottom: 40px; color: #ffcc80;"><em>"I have won the throne, but the kingdom is burning. The dragon has been slain, but the tiger is waiting at the gate."</em></p>

            <p>The cheering outside the "New Taiwanese Service Team" headquarters on Ren'ai Road is loud, but to your ears, it sounds thin. It lacks the deep, resonant bass of a landslide. It is the high-pitched, hysterical relief of a man who has just walked across a tightrope over a canyon and collapsed on the other side.</p>
            
            <p>You, <strong>James Soong</strong>, stand alone in the washroom attached to your office. You splash cold water on your face. You look at yourself in the mirror. The "Governor." The "Commander." And now... the <strong>President</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>But the numbers on the television screen in the other room are burned into your mind, cold and unforgiving. You have secured victory with <strong>${quickstats[1].toFixed(1)}%</strong> of the vote. It is enough to win under the First-Past-The-Post system, but it is not enough to silence the wolves. In any decent democracy, this would be a runoff. In Taiwan, it is a verdict.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong> is right behind you. The difference is agonizingly small. The "Son of Taiwan" surged in the final weeks, swallowing the south whole, mobilizing a Green tide that nearly breached the seawall. He didn't lose because he was unpopular; he lost because the "Blue" vote—split as it was—was just barely larger than the "Green" vote. He is not a defeated candidate; he is the leader of a government-in-waiting, controlling nearly 35% of the population, armed with passion and grievance.</p>
            
            <p>And <strong>Lien Chan</strong>? He is finished. A distant third. The KMT machine, with its billions of dollars and century of history, has collapsed into irrelevance. This gives you a grim satisfaction, but also a strategic headache. You have destroyed the party that birthed you, but now you must govern its ruins.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chen Wan-shui</strong> enters the room. She moves quietly, sensing your mood. She doesn't offer empty congratulations. She hands you a fresh towel. "It’s going to be hard, Chu-yu," she says softly. "Harder than the campaign. Half the country thinks you stole it. The other half thinks you are a traitor to the party."</p>
            
            <p>You wipe your face. "I know," you reply. "A-Bian won't concede. Not in his heart. He will take to the streets. He will say that a President with 34% of the vote has no mandate."</p>
            
            <p>You walk back into the main office. <strong>Chang Chao-hsiung</strong>, your Vice President-elect, is on the phone with the Americans. He looks pale. "The AIT is asking about the protests in Kaohsiung," Chang whispers, covering the mouthpiece. "The DPP supporters are refusing to leave the polling stations. They are shouting <em>'Invalid Election.'</em>"</p>
            
            <p>You take the phone. You switch into your "Governor" persona—calm, authoritative, the man who solved problems while others talked. "Tell the Director that order will be maintained," you say firmly. "Tell him that democracy is messy, but the numbers are final. I am the President. I will form a 'Grand Coalition' government. I will invite DPP members into the cabinet."</p>
            
            <p>It is a lie, or at least, a desperate hope. You know A-Bian will never join you. He will besiege you.</p>
            
            <p>You think of <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong> in the Presidential Palace. The old man must be laughing his bitter laugh. He failed to install Lien, yes. But he has left you a poisoned chalice. He has left you a country divided down the middle, a legislature controlled by enemies, and a legitimacy crisis that will dog you from Day One. He broke the KMT to stop you, and though he failed to stop you, he succeeded in breaking the country.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Liu Sung-pan</strong>, the former Legislative Speaker who defected to your side, approaches with a glass of whiskey. "We beat the Black Gold," he grunts. "We beat the machine."</p>
            
            <p>"We <em>are</em> the machine now," you correct him. "And it's broken."</p>
            
            <p>You have to go out there. You have to face the cameras. You have to face the people. Not just your supporters—the fervent, orange-clad loyalists who worship you—but the millions of Taiwanese who just voted for Chen Shui-bian and are currently weeping in the rain.</p>
            
            <p>You step onto the balcony. The cool night air hits you. The roar of the crowd is deafening, a wave of orange flags waving frantically. They don't care about the percentage. They only see the victory.</p>
            
            <p>"My fellow countrymen!" you shout. The microphone feedback squeals.</p>
            
            <p>"Tonight, the people have spoken! It was a close race! It was a hard fight!"</p>
            
            <p>You look out at the dark skyline of Taipei. You can see the lights of the DPP headquarters in the distance. It is dark there, but you know they are not sleeping. They are sharpening their knives.</p>
            
            <p>"I will be a President for all Taiwanese!" you declare, trying to sound convinced. "Whether you voted for Mr. Chen, or Mr. Lien, I am your servant! We must heal the wounds! We must look forward!"</p>
            
            <p>The crowd cheers, but you feel the chill. You have won the title, but you have not won the heart of the island. You are a minority President, squeezed between a vengeful KMT establishment and a rising, furious DPP.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chen Wan-shui</strong> squeezes your hand. You squeeze back, holding on for dear life.</p>
            
            <p>The era of Soong has begun, but it begins not with a sunrise, but with a storm warning.</p>

                "Students, today we'll look back at a politician who won the mayoralty in 1994, lost the presidency in 2000, and then won the presidency in 2004. This <span class='highlight'>experience of dramatic wins and losses</span> forged Chen Shui-bian's political legend. Let's analyze how this 'undying cockroach' pulled off this miracle amidst James Soong's chaotic administration."

            <div class="discussion-point">
                "Mr. Lin, Ah-Bian won the Taipei Mayoralty in '94 but lost to Ma Ying-jeou in '98. Then in the 2000 Presidential Election, although his vote share wasn't the highest, he <span class='highlight'>was only slightly behind Soong Chu-yu</span>, ultimately losing as the second-place candidate. Having lost the '98 mayoralty and the 2000 presidency consecutively, it truly feels like a rollercoaster ride."
            </div>

            <p class="speaker-teacher">Mr. Lin (Civics)</p>
            <div class="discussion-point">
                "Exactly. This was the consequence of James Soong's <span class='highlight'>narrow victory with the lowest vote share in history (less than 35%)</span>. Even though he won, in political science, this is called a <span class='highlight'>legitimacy crisis</span>. Only one-third of the people supported you! Chen Shui-bian seized on this, constantly questioning the legitimacy of President Soong. The four years from 2000 to 2004 became the most boisterous and chaotic period in Taiwan's history."
            </div>

            <div class="discussion-point">
                "So what was it like those four years? Was it a street party every day?"
            </div>
            
            <p class="speaker-teacher">Mr. Lin (Civics)</p>
            <div class="discussion-point">
                "You could see it that way! The DPP turned those four years into a <span class='highlight'>nationwide street movement carnival</span>. Although Chen Shui-bian lost the election, he acted more like a president than Soong. He led crowds in the streets, demanding 'power back to the people' and challenging Soong's every policy. As for Soong? Lacking a popular mandate and facing legislative boycotts from hostile forces, his administrative capability was <span class='highlight'>completely stalled</span>. The nation saw no major construction, no reform, only endless political infighting and media smear campaigns. Society was utterly exhausted."

            <p class="speaker-student">Xiao Hua (12th Grade)</p>
            <div class="discussion-point">
                "I see! The extreme of chaos is opportunity. The people were sick of the political deadlock during the Soong era and needed a strong figure to end the turmoil. Chen Shui-bian's accumulated popularity and mobilization power on the streets made him look like <span class='highlight'>the only person who could clean up the mess</span>."
            </div>

            <p class="speaker-teacher">Mr. Lin (Civics)</p>
            <div class="discussion-point">
                "It was this <span class='highlight'>exhaustion</span> that became the DPP's greatest asset. In the 2004 election, Chen Shui-bian barely had to campaign; the voters' subconscious thought was: <span class='highlight'>four more years of Soong Chu-yu, and we might go crazy</span>. Thus, Chen Shui-bian easily harvested the fatigue with the chaos, defeated Soong, successfully won the presidency, and was re-elected in 2012, ushering in eight years of DPP prominence. Soong Chu-yu faded from the political scene forever."

            <p>The office of the "New Taiwanese Service Team" on Ren'ai Road is not silent. Silence would be a mercy. Instead, it is filled with the sounds of a massacre—not of bodies, but of dreams. You hear the sobbing of grown men, the shattering of glass against walls, and the incoherent screaming of staff members who cannot comprehend the numbers flashing on the television screens.</p>
            
            <p>You, <strong>James Soong (Soong Chu-yu)</strong>, sit in your leather chair, your body frozen in a state of shock that transcends grief. It is a physical paralysis. You stare at the breakdown:</p>
            
            <p><strong>1. Chen Shui-bian (DPP) - ELECTED.</strong><br>
            <strong>2. Lien Chan (KMT).</strong><br>
            <strong>3. James Soong (Independent).</strong></p>
            
            <p><strong>Third.</strong></p>
            
            <p>The word tastes like poison in your mouth. You, the "Governor of the Province," the most popular politician in Taiwan for the last decade, the man who visited 309 townships, the man who personally paved the roads and built the bridges... you have been relegated to the dustbin of history. You are not even the runner-up. You are the spoiler. The loser.</p>
            
            <p>A wave of nausea hits you, followed immediately by a white-hot, blinding rage. It wasn't the voters. The voters loved you. You saw it in their eyes in Taichung, in Kaohsiung, in the Hakka villages. They wanted to vote for you.</p>
            
            <p>It was <strong>Them</strong>. The Establishment.</p>
            
            <p>You close your eyes and you see his face. <strong>Ma Ying-jeou</strong>. The KMT's "Golden Boy," the Mayor of Taipei. You recall the press conference from just a few days ago. Ma, with his clean, honest face, looking into the camera and holding up those "internal polls."</p>
            
            <p><em>"Lien Chan has surged,"</em> Ma had lied, his voice trembling with faux sincerity. <em>"Soong Chu-yu is out of the race. The gap is widening. If you want to stop A-Bian, you must vote for Lien."</em></p>
            
            <p>It was a lie. A calculated, cold-blooded fabrication designed to trigger the "Dump-Save" (棄保) effect. And it worked. God help you, it worked. The wavering voters, terrified of a Chen Shui-bian presidency and the war it might bring, panicked. They looked at Ma Ying-jeou—the symbol of integrity—and they believed him. They abandoned you to "save" the Republic, and in doing so, they handed the Republic to the separatists.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chen Wan-shui</strong> is kneeling beside your chair. She is weeping, not for herself, but for you. She holds your hand, her tears wetting your knuckles. "They are wicked, Chu-yu," she sobs. "They are wicked people. Lee Teng-hui... he would rather see the country die than see you win."</p>
            
            <p>The name acts like a galvanic shock. <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong>. The "Godfather" in the Presidential Palace. The architect of this tragedy. He knew Lien Chan couldn't win. Lien has the charisma of a damp rag. Lee knew it. But Lee hated you. He feared you. You were the only one who could unite the Mainlanders and the Taiwanese, the only one who could actually govern this island effectively. And that made you dangerous.</p>
            
            <p>So he invented the <strong>"Chung Hsing Bills" (Xing Piao)</strong> scandal. He dragged your name through the mud, painting you—the cleanest administrator in government—as a thief. He used the courts, the prosecutors, and the state media to bleed you dry for months. And when that wasn't enough, he ordered Ma Ying-jeou to execute the final betrayal with the fake polls.</p>
            
            <p>And what is the result? You look at the TV screen. <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong> is on stage, wearing his green cap, raising his hands in victory. The "Green Terror" has arrived. The KMT has lost power for the first time in 55 years. The Republic of China is now in the hands of a party that has "Independence" in its charter.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chang Chao-hsiung</strong>, your running mate, slams his fist onto the table, shattering a tea cup. "They are the sinners of history!" Chang screams, his usual doctor's demeanor gone. "The KMT leadership... Lee, Lien, Ma... they are the sinners of history! They split the Blue vote! Together we had 60%! Divided, we gave it to A-Bian!"</p>
            
            <p>He is right. If you add your votes to Lien's, you would have crushed Chen Shui-bian. It would have been a landslide. But the KMT chose suicide over compromise.</p>
            
            <p>You stand up. Your legs feel heavy, like lead. You walk to the window. Outside, the rain is pouring down on Taipei, washing away the orange flags that litter the gutter. You see your supporters huddled in the street. They are not leaving. They are hugging each other, crying openly. They know what happened. They know they were cheated.</p>
            
            <p>A young aide approaches you, terrified. "Governor... the press is waiting. You have to concede."</p>
            
            <p>"Concede?" you snarl, turning on him. "Concede to whom? To the man who won with few votes? Or to the party that lied its way to second place?"</p>
            
            <p>But you know you must go out there. You are James Soong. You must have dignity, even when your enemies have none.</p>
            
            <p>You straighten your tie. You wipe the sweat from your forehead. You think of the millions of people who voted for you—the "New Taiwanese." They were the ones who wanted to transcend the ethnic hatred, who wanted a government that worked. And tonight, they have been told that their voice doesn't matter because the system is rigged against outsiders.</p>
            
            <p>You step out onto the balcony. The crowd sees you and a sound rises up—a low, mournful wail that turns into a roar of defiance. <em>"Song Chu-yu! Song Chu-yu!"</em></p>
            
            <p>You grip the podium. Your knuckles are white. You look into the cameras, imagining <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong> watching from his office, imagining <strong>Ma Ying-jeou</strong> watching from City Hall.</p>
            
            <p>"My friends," you say, your voice shaking with suppressed fury. "We fought the good fight."</p>
            
            <p>"We fought against the money! We fought against the lies! We fought against the entire state machine!"</p>
            
            <p>The crowd screams in agreement. <em>"Invalid Election! Invalid Election!"</em> they chant.</p>
            
            <p>"Tonight, the KMT has lost the country," you declare, pointing a finger at the invisible enemy. "Not because the people wanted change, but because the leadership of the KMT betrayed the people! They used false numbers! They used character assassination! And in doing so, they have become the <strong>Sinners of the Ages (千古罪人)</strong>!"</p>
            
            <p>You pause, breathing heavily. You look at <strong>Chen Wan-shui</strong> standing in the wings, wiping her eyes. You realize that your political career in the KMT is over. You can never go back. They burned the bridge, and then they blew up the cliff.</p>
            
            <p>"But we are not finished!" you shout, trying to find a ember of hope in the ashes. "We will form a new path! We will be the true voice of the people! We will not let this country fall into ruin!"</p>
            
            <p>But deep down, as you look at the victorious images of Chen Shui-bian on the giant screens across the street, you know the truth. The dam has broken. The genie is out of the bottle. The "Third Place" is a graveyard.</p>
            
            <p>You turn away from the crowd, feeling older than you have ever felt in your life. You were the Crown Prince. You were the Governor. You were the inevitable President. And tonight, thanks to the envy of an old man and the lies of a young one, you are nothing but a footnote in the tragedy of the Republic.</p>

            【2024 Political Hermit】James Soong: The Third-Party's Destiny
        </h1>

        <div class="reflection-box">
            <p class="setting-detail">California, USA, a sunny Tuesday afternoon. Familiar Taiwanese Mandarin drifts from the television.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 0.95em;">
                James Soong gently put down his newspaper, his eyes fixed on the screen. The anchor was analyzing the "three-way race" for the 2024 Taiwanese presidential election: the DPP’s Lai Ching-te, the KMT’s Eric Chu, and the TPP’s Ko Wen-je. He had been in the United States for nearly a quarter of a century, living the quiet life of a <span class='highlight'>political hermit</span>, far from the humidity and clamor of Taipei’s politics.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 0.95em;">
                The 2000 election, to him, was not a competition but a sacrifice. The KMT's <span class='highlight'>"Abandon Soong to Save Lien"</span> strategy, though deployed too late and with insufficient force, ultimately worked. Votes flowed to Lien Chan, securing him second place and dropping Soong to third. This failure allowed Chen Shui-bian to achieve the improbable victory, ending the KMT's fifty years of rule.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 0.95em;'>
                He recalled the night the results were finalized, the immense irony in his heart as he finished third. His political life and the future of his new People First Party (PFP) had become a <span class='highlight'>sacrificial offering to the KMT’s desperate survival strategy</span>.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 0.95em;'>
                He knew he couldn't stay in Taiwan after the defeat. He was branded by the Pan-Blue camp as the <span class='highlight'>chief sinner</span> who handed power to the DPP. The public and the party machine didn't need to analyze right or wrong; they just needed an outlet for their anger. For the KMT's survival—and Lien Chan's future—he had to be the one sacrificed and forgotten. So, just days after the loss, he quietly flew to the US under the guise of "recuperation," <span class='highlight'>completely wiping his political slate clean</span>.
            </p>
            
            <h4 style="color: #005696; border-bottom: 1px dotted #CCC; padding-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 30px;">Historical Trajectory: Stability Bought by His Exile</h4>

            <p class="timeline-event">
                Soong's exile unexpectedly accelerated the Pan-Blue camp's healing. Without his continuous obstruction, Lien Chan successfully consolidated all Pan-Blue votes in 2004, easily defeated Chen Shui-bian, and governed stably until 2012.
            </p>
            <p class="timeline-event">
                In 2012, the KMT passed the baton to the clean-imaged Ma Ying-jeou, who easily defeated the DPP’s Tsai Ing-wen, extending the KMT's rule until 2020.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 0.95em;">
                For two decades, Soong Chu-yu's figure never reappeared on Taiwan's political stage. The PFP he founded was already defunct in all but name, its members mostly retired or quietly <span class='highlight'>returned to the embrace of the KMT</span>. The former Governor, once supported by millions, ultimately facilitated sixteen years of stable KMT rule—while he himself was permanently excluded from the center of power.
            </p>

            <h4 style="color: #AA4A44; border-bottom: 1px dotted #CCC; padding-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 30px;">2024: Ko Wen-je's Reflection</h4>

            <p style="font-size: 0.95em;">
                His gaze settled on Ko Wen-je, the TPP chairman in a white jacket, attempting to be the <span class='highlight'>third force to break the KMT-DPP deadlock</span>.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 0.95em;">
                "Alas..." Soong murmured, his sigh deeper. He saw Ko's naive idealism, and he also saw the formidable, underlying power structure of the two major parties, capable of consuming everything. He knew that when the life-and-death moment of voting arrived, the KMT would ruthlessly reintroduce the narrative of <span class='highlight'>"division is the original sin,"</span> forcing voters to fall back into line.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 0.95em;">
                He slowly rose and turned off the television. Twenty-four years of exile had taught him: in the Taiwanese political landscape, sometimes the <span class='highlight'>greatest tragedy is not defeat, but causing the split</span>. And Ko Wen-je was walking the exact same road he had walked—the road to political oblivion. He lamented for Ko, and he lamented for himself.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.1em; opacity: 0.9; margin-bottom: 40px; color: #ffca28;"><em>"We united the people, but we could not defeat the ghost. The majority has spoken, but the minority has taken the throne."</em></p>

            <p>The roar from the street below is not the sound of a celebration, nor is it the sound of a defeat. It is the sound of an insurrection. The air inside the "New Taiwanese Service Team" headquarters on Ren'ai Road is vibrating, physically shaking from the collective rage of half the population of Taiwan. It is a dangerous, volatile noise—the sound of millions of people who realized they did everything right, and were still robbed by the cruel arithmetic of democracy.</p>
            
            <p>You, <strong>James Soong</strong>, stand before the wall of monitors, your hands gripping the back of a chair so hard the leather is tearing. You stare at the numbers. They are grotesque. They are impossible.</p>
            
            <p>You focus on your own tally: <strong>${quickstats[1].toFixed(1)}%</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>You have lost. You have lost by a margin so thin it is almost invisible. You have secured a vote share that, in any other election in the history of the Republic, would guarantee a landslide victory. You have done what the pundits said was impossible: you successfully triggered the "Strategic Voting" (棄保). The voters listened to you. They abandoned the KMT. They dumped <strong>Lien Chan</strong> into the dustbin of history, reducing the century-old party to a humiliating, single-digit rump. They consolidated behind you to save the Republic of China.</p>
            
            <p>But it wasn't enough. <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong> has edged ahead. Just barely. A ghost of a lead.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chen Wan-shui</strong> is standing in the corner, her face pale, pressing a handkerchief to her lips. She looks terrified. Not of the loss, but of what comes next. "The people are furious, Chu-yu," she whispers, her voice barely audible over the chanting outside. "They aren't going home. They are marching on the Presidential Palace. They are saying the election is invalid. They are saying A-Bian stole it."</p>
            
            <p>You look at the television screens. She is right. The streets of Taipei are a sea of orange and blue flags, now merged into a single river of fury. Police barricades are being overrun. Molotov cocktails are being thrown at the KMT headquarters—not by DPP supporters, but by your supporters, furious at the KMT for not withdrawing Lien Chan. If Lien had just dropped out... if he had just taken his pitiful remaining votes and endorsed you... you would be President with a massive absolute majority. The country would be united.</p>
            
            <p>Instead, <strong>Lien Chan</strong>—the stubborn, wooden puppet of the establishment—stayed in the race just long enough to act as the spoiler. He didn't win; he committed suicide, and he took the Republic of China down with him. And behind him, you see the shadow of <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong>. The old man must be sitting in his office, watching the city burn. Did he plan this? Did he know that even if the "Dump-Lien" effect happened, it wouldn't be clean enough? He has handed the country to the separatists rather than let you, the "Mainlander," take power.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chang Chao-hsiung</strong>, your running mate, is red-faced, shouting into a telephone. "No! We do not concede! How can we concede?" He slams the phone down and turns to you, his eyes wild. "Governor, look at your numbers! <strong>${quickstats[1].toFixed(1)}%</strong>! And we lose? The invalid ballots... there are 300,000 invalid ballots! This is fraud! This is a coup by the establishment and the DPP combined!"</p>
            
            <p>You walk to the window. The rain is lashing down, but it cannot extinguish the fires burning in the streets. You see the faces of your supporters—veterans, farmers, middle-class mothers. They are screaming. They feel the injustice in their bones. They constitute the largest bloc of this island, yet they are shut out of power.</p>
            
            <p>This is not just a defeat; it is a constitutional crisis. A President elected with a minority of the vote, while the vast majority of the people voted for a pro-ROC platform (splitting their votes between you and Lien), will have no legitimacy. The legislature will be hostile. The military will be suspicious. The streets will be ungovernable.</p>
            
            <p>A senior general calls your private line. You stare at the ringing phone. You know what he wants to say. The military is restless. They are waiting for a signal. If you go out onto that balcony and declare the election invalid, if you call for a "Restore the Republic" movement, you could bring the government to its knees. You could stop A-Bian before he even takes the oath.</p>
            
            <p>But you look at Wan-shui. You see the fear in her eyes. You remember the martial law era. You remember the chaos of the transition. Do you want to be the man who starts a civil war?</p>
            
            <p>"Chu-yu," Wan-shui says softly, touching your arm. "You are the un-crowned King. Don't become the Warlord."</p>
            
            <p>You pick up the phone. "Stand down," you tell the general, your voice sounding like gravel. "The Republic of China is a democracy. We will fight this in the courts, not in the barracks."</p>
            
            <p>You hang up. The decision is made. But the bitterness tastes like bile.</p>
            
            <p>You step out onto the balcony to face the mob. The noise is physical. It hits you like a shockwave. <em>"Song Zongtong! Song Zongtong!"</em> They refuse to accept the result. They are waving signs that read <strong>"The Nation is Dead"</strong> and <strong>"Lien Chan is a Sinner."</strong></p>
            
            <p>You grip the podium. You are the tragic hero of this opera. You won the argument. You won the campaign. You destroyed the KMT. You mobilized the people. But you lost the count.</p>
            
            <p>"My friends!" you bellow, and for a moment, the riot quiets down to listen to its leader.</p>
            
            <p>"We have won the hearts of the Taiwanese people!" you shout, pointing at the sky. "The numbers on that screen are cold, but your blood is hot! We have proven that the KMT is dead! We have proven that the people wanted a Third Way!"</p>
            
            <p>You pause, letting the rain soak your shirt. "They may take the office," you snarl, pointing toward the Presidential Palace, "but they will never take our dignity! We are the moral majority! We are the guardians of the Republic! And we will be watching them!"</p>
            
            <p>The crowd roars, a sound of defiance and grief. But as you look out over the chaotic, fractured city, you know the truth. The "Golden Decade" is over. A-Bian will take power, but he will rule over a ruin. The KMT is shattered. The PFP is angry. The country is split down the middle, held together only by the fragile tape of a democratic system that just failed its stress test.</p>
            
            <p>You turn away from the microphone, feeling the immense weight of the "What Ifs." If only Lien had stepped down. If only the missiles hadn't fired. If only you had shaken one more hand. You secured <strong>${quickstats[1].toFixed(1)}%</strong> of the vote, a historic achievement, yet tonight, you are a king without a crown, watching your kingdom burn.</p>

            The President's Succession Dilemma: The Heir to the Soong Dynasty
        </h1>
        
        <p class="setting-note">Presidential Office Reception Room, March 2011. PFP President James Soong holds a closed-door meeting with Chief Aide Vivian Huang (Huang Shan-shan).</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">
            In the office, President Soong pushes a list containing the names of three potential successors toward Huang Shan-shan. This list carries the future of the People First Party (Orange Camp) and will determine whether Taiwan's politics can maintain the long-term state of <span class='highlight'>Orange-Green Confrontation</span>.
        </p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">
            Soong recalls the 2000 election: he lost bitterly despite an astonishing vote share exceeding 40%. Yet, this result utterly defeated the KMT's Lien Chan, pushing him to third place and ensuring <span class='highlight'>the KMT's brand was effectively dead</span>. Subsequently, by securing numerous seats in the 2001 legislative election, the PFP firmly established its leadership over the opposition, setting the political landscape as an <span class='highlight'>Orange vs. Green showdown</span>. This momentum allowed him to defeat Chen Shui-bian in 2004 and successfully fend off Hsieh Chang-ting's challenge in 2008. Now, his eight-year term is nearing its end, and the moment for transition has arrived. He must ensure the orange torch continues to burn brightly.

        <div class="dialogue-box">
            <p class="speaker-soong">President Soong:</p>
            <p>“Shan-shan, time is running out. The DPP will certainly launch an all-out counterattack this time. Su Tseng-chang, Annette Lu, Yu Shyi-kun, and Frank Hsieh—any of them could emerge as the challenger. We must select someone who can both safeguard the Orange Camp's eight years of achievements and win in 2012.”</p>

            <p class="speaker-huang">Vivian Huang:</p>
            <p>“Mr. President, the DPP’s challenges are multifaceted. Su Tseng-chang’s administrative efficiency will encroach on our strength; Annette Lu's ideology will mobilize the deep-green base. In this battle, we need candidates with the ability to <span class='highlight'>reassure the public</span> and <span class='highlight'>transcend the Pan-Blue/Pan-Green divide</span>.”</p>

            <h3>A. Vice President Chang Chao-hsiung: Conservatism and Professionalism</h3>
            <p class="speaker-soong">President Soong:</p>
            <p>“Vice President Chang is professional and can continue my 'efficient governance' style. But you see, he lacks charisma for the streets. If he faces Su Tseng-chang, won't the campaign momentum be too subdued?”</p>
            <p class="speaker-huang">Vivian Huang:</p>
            <p>“That's the risk. He is suitable as a steady successor, but his <span class='highlight'>'shield' might be too thin</span> against the DPP's heavy firepower. We need a more aggressive candidate who can take the offensive.”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="analysis-item">
            <h3>B. Premier Wu Den-yih: Tradition and Grassroots</h3>
            <p class="speaker-soong">President Soong:</p>
            <p>“Wu Den-yih has deep grassroots experience and is an eloquent speaker—an ideal choice for securing traditional votes in central and southern Taiwan. But he was, after all, a KMT heavyweight. Will the Orange Camp voters have <span class='highlight'>reservations about 'returning to the old era'</span>? I worry about losing the youth vote.”</p>
            <p class="speaker-huang">Vivian Huang:</p>
            <p>“He certainly can win over some traditional supporters, but he also gives the DPP an excuse to attack us, dragging us back into <span class='highlight'>the KMT's past scandals</span>. His strengths and weaknesses are equally obvious, making it difficult to achieve a high-vote breakthrough.”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="analysis-item">
            <h3>C. Business Magnate Terry Gou (Guo Tai-ming): Change and the High-Stakes Gamble</h3>
            <p class="speaker-huang">Vivian Huang:</p>
            <p>“Mr. President, Mr. Gou is our <span class='highlight'>'nuclear-level' option</span>. He completely breaks free from the Blue-Green framework, appealing to the economy and technology. He will be hugely attractive to young voters and centrists. This is the ultimate change card.”</p>
            <p class="speaker-soong">President Soong:</p>
            <p>“But the risk is too high. He has zero political experience, and his judgment on cross-strait and international affairs is untested. If he missteps in a debate, or displays the <span class='highlight'>'assertiveness' of a businessman rather than the 'gravitas' of a president</span>, our efforts could all be in vain.”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue-box" style="margin-top: 30px;">
            <p class="speaker-soong">President Soong:</p>
            <p>“The conservative choice has the least risk, but limited potential; the traditional choice is stable but difficult to expand; the high-stakes gamble has the highest potential, but extreme risk.”</p>
            <p class="speaker-huang">Vivian Huang:</p>
            <p>“Mr. President, the lesson we learned from the 2000 defeat is that: <span class='highlight'>only by bravely pursuing change can we make voters forget the pain of failure</span>. If we only nominate a 'conservative,' it will be difficult to generate enough enthusiasm to counter the DPP’s 2012 resurgence.”</p>
        </div>

        <p class="paragraph" style="margin-top: 30px;">
            Soong slowly walked to the window, watching the traffic flow below in Taipei. He knew Huang was right. The PFP's rise itself was a daring gamble. The 2012 election will be the pivotal battle for Taiwan's <span class='highlight'>Post-Soong Era</span>, allowing for no conservatism. The scale in his heart was already tipping toward the person who carried the greatest risk, but who could best break the political stalemate.

            <p>The rain in Taipei tonight is relentless. It does not cleanse; it drowns. It falls upon the orange flags scattered in the gutters of Ren'ai Road, turning the paper slogans promising "A New Future" into gray, dissolving pulp. Inside the headquarters of the New Taiwanese Service Team, the air is thick with a suffocating mixture of cigarette smoke, sweat, and the metallic taste of absolute, crushing disbelief. You, <strong>James Soong</strong>, stand at the window of your private office, looking out at the blur of streetlights. You are the "Governor." The "Commander." The man who visited 309 townships. The man who speaks Hakka to the Hakkas, Minnan to the Islanders, and Mandarin to the Soldiers. You are the most capable administrator this island has ever produced. And you have lost.</p>
            
            <p>The numbers on the television screen burn with a cold, green malevolence. They are etched into your soul forever. You focus only on your own number: <strong>${quickstats[1].toFixed(1)}%</strong>. It is a massive number. It is a number that represents millions of screaming voices, millions of hopes, and a political movement built from nothing but sheer will. In any normal election, in any two-way race, this number would guarantee a landslide victory. But this was not a normal election. This was a suicide pact.</p>
            
            <p>You turn away from the window. The silence in the room is heavy. <strong>Chang Chao-hsiung</strong>, your running mate, is sitting with his head in his hands. He is a doctor, a man of science, but there is no medicine for this. "We beat the KMT," Chang whispers, his voice trembling. "We destroyed the establishment candidate. We took the Center. We took the North. How did we lose?" But you know exactly how you lost. It wasn't because of <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong>. A-Bian played his role perfectly, mobilizing the discontent, the "Formosa" dreamers. He was a worthy opponent. No, you did not lose to the DPP. You were murdered by your own family.</p>
            
            <p>You close your eyes and you see the face of <strong>Ma Ying-jeou</strong>. The "Golden Boy." The Mayor of Taipei. The man who stood before the cameras just days ago, his face a mask of earnest, clean-cut integrity, and told the biggest lie in the history of Taiwanese politics. <em>"Our internal polls show the KMT candidate is surging,"</em> Ma had said, holding up those fabricated charts. <em>"Soong Chu-yu is out of the race. If you vote for Soong, you are letting A-Bian win."</em> The "Fake Polls" (假民調). It was a dagger in the dark. It stopped your momentum dead. It terrified the wavering voters—the elderly veterans, the nervous middle class who feared war above all else. They wanted to vote for you, but Ma scared them back to the KMT candidate. And those votes—those precious, stolen votes that went to a hopeless third-place finisher—were the votes that should have carried you to the Presidency.</p>
            
            <p>And behind Ma, looming like a dark shadow over the Presidential Palace, is <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong>. The "Godfather." The man who treated you like a son when you were his enforcer, and then tried to destroy you when you became too popular. The "Chung Hsing Bills" (Xing Piao) scandal. The months of investigation. The character assassination. Lee didn't care if the KMT lost. He didn't care if the Republic of China fell into the hands of the independence movement. He only cared about one thing: <strong>Killing James Soong.</strong> Tonight, Lee Teng-hui has his wish. He has destroyed the KMT to stop you. He has handed the keys of the nation to Chen Shui-bian, a man he secretly admires, rather than let the "Mainlander" governor take the throne. It is a Greek tragedy of spite. The teacher has burned down the school to prevent the student from becoming the principal.</p>
            
            <p>A soft hand touches your arm. It is <strong>Chen Wan-shui</strong>. Your wife. "Sister Wan-shui" to the millions who adore her. She looks older tonight. The campaign has taken a terrible toll on her health. The insults, the lawsuits, the sleepless nights. She gazes at you with eyes that are filled not with disappointment, but with a profound, aching sadness for the country. "They didn't deserve you, Chu-yu," she says softly. "You worked harder than anyone. You loved them more than anyone. But fear... fear is stronger than love." You look at her and your heart breaks. You remember the rallies. The old women in the markets grabbing your hands, their calloused palms pressing against yours, crying, <em>"Governor Soong, save us."</em> You remember the aboriginal chiefs wrapping you in their traditional cloth. You remember the soldiers saluting you. You were the "New Taiwanese." You were the bridge. And now, the bridge is broken. The country is split into three jagged pieces. Green, Blue, and Orange. And the Green minority has seized the crown because the Blue and Orange could not reconcile.</p>
            
            <p>The door bursts open. A senior aide runs in, his face flushed, holding a portable radio. "Governor, you have to hear this. The KMT headquarters... it's a war zone." You turn on the news. The scene is apocalyptic. Thousands of furious supporters—many of them KMT members who voted for you, or loyalists who realized too late they were tricked—are surrounding the KMT central office. They are throwing eggs, stones, and paint. They are scaling the barricades. The chant is deafening: <strong>"Lee Teng-hui, Step Down! Lee Teng-hui, Traitor!"</strong> They are beating up KMT officials. They are demanding justice. They know, deep in their bones, that this election was a fraud—not of the ballot count, but of the truth. They know that if the KMT candidate had withdrawn, or if the fake polls hadn't been released, you would be winning with a massive absolute majority.</p>
            
            <p>Your phone rings. It is a general from the military police. "Mr. Soong," he says, his voice tight. "The situation is critical. The crowd is out of control. If you give the word... if you lead them... we don't know what will happen." The temptation is a physical weight in your chest. You could do it. You could walk out there, drive to the KMT headquarters, and stand on top of a car. You could declare the election invalid due to the Xing Piao manipulation. You could call for a recount, a new election. You have millions of votes—far more than the KMT candidate. You have the moral mandate. You could start a revolution tonight. But then you look at Wan-shui. You look at the rain falling on the peaceful, democratic island you helped build during the transition from martial law. You remember your mentor, Chiang Ching-kuo. He lifted the ban on parties so that this day could happen. Even if it is a bitter day. "No," you say into the phone. "We follow the law. We are not warlords. We are the servants of the people."</p>
            
            <p>You hang up the phone. You adjust your orange tie. The color of the earth. The color of the harvest. It is time to face the music. You walk out to the main hall. The staff are weeping openly. Grown men are hugging each other, sobbing. They feel the injustice like a knife in the gut. You step onto the balcony. The lights blind you. The roar of the crowd is a mixture of adoration and agony. <em>"Song Zongtong! Song Zongtong!"</em> They refuse to accept the result. "My friends!" you shout, your voice cracking slightly before finding its old iron strength. "The rain falls on the just and the unjust alike!" The crowd quiets, listening to their leader.</p>
            
            <p>"We have fought the greatest campaign in the history of Taiwan!" you declare. "We had no party assets! We had no government machine! We had only the people! And look at what we did!" You point to the screen showing your vote count: <strong>${quickstats[1].toFixed(1)}%</strong>. "We have defeated the century-old Kuomintang!" you shout, and the crowd roars with a savage joy. "We have proven that the people are the masters, not the parties!" You pause. "Mr. Chen has won the count," you say, and the boos are deafening. You raise a hand. "But we... we have won the heart of Taiwan. We are the guardians of the Republic of China. We will not disappear. We will form a new force. A force that puts the <strong>People First</strong>!"</p>
            
            <p>As the confetti cannons fire—a planned celebration for a victory that didn't happen—the orange paper mixes with the rain, falling like autumn leaves. You look toward the distance, toward the dark outline of the Presidential Palace. A-Bian will move in there soon. He will find it a lonely place. He has won the presidency, but he has not won the country. The majority—the combined Pan-Blue majority—is against him. And you? You are the tragic hero. The man who was too capable for his boss, too popular for his party, and too honest for the dirty tricks of his rivals. You have fallen just short of the summit. <strong>Chiou I-jen</strong> and the DPP are celebrating a miracle. <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong> is smiling in the shadows. But as you look at the tear-streaked faces of your supporters, you make a silent vow. You will not fade away. You will build the <strong>People First Party</strong>. You will hold the balance of power. You will be the Kingmaker, if not the King. But tonight... tonight, you simply have to endure the pain of being the greatest President Taiwan never had.</p>

        <h1 class="debate-title">The Twenty-Year Historical Rite: Fated Destiny and the Eternal 2000</h1>

        <p>
            Time: Late 2019, Presidential Election Debate. Setting: Under the Spotlight. Candidates: Tsai Ing-wen (Green), Han Kuo-yu (Blue), James Soong (Orange).
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Standing at the center of the debate stage, James Soong felt he was no longer a candidate, but an embodiment of history. The air around him condensed into an invisible wall, separating him from the restless crowd below. This was his fifth time standing in this "Roman Colosseum," each appearance an iterative ritual commemorating the defeat two decades prior. He remembered clearly how, in 2000, he lost with a stunningly high vote count, trailing Chen Shui-bian by only a tiny margin, yet irrevocably severing the umbilical cord of the old system. That fracture, like the flap of a butterfly's wing, gently redirected the river of Taiwanese politics onto a completely different course.
        </p>

        <h2>The Clamor of Blue and Green: The Two Poles of Destiny</h2>
        
        <p>
            Now, he was compelled to listen to the two leaders of the mainstream forces before him; their sharp dialogue was a sarcastic summary of twenty years of political disorder.
        </p>

        <div class="candidate-line tsai">
            <span class="speaker" style="color: #006400;">Tsai Ing-wen (Calm yet pointed):</span>
            "I just heard Mayor Han state unequivocally that he does not accept 'One Country, Two Systems.' But when Xi Jinping first began to speak of the '1992 Consensus, One Country, Two Systems,' Mayor Han's reply was that he wasn't clear, he equivocated, and even went to visit the Liaison Office in March, creating an atmosphere conducive to 'One Country, Two Systems.' I must tell Mayor Han: perhaps you reject 'One Country, Two Systems' now, but a leader should not only adopt a position when forced by social pressure. A leader must lead society, making swift decisions when they must be made, and guiding the people's reaction to any changes in the situation, not merely reacting after the public has reacted or pressure has mounted."
        </div>

        <div class="candidate-line han">
            <span class="speaker" style="color: #00008B;">Han Kuo-yu (Passionate and retaliatory):</span>
            "I absolutely respect media freedom, but the Taiwan 2020 Presidential election has never been this dirty in the past year and a half. For a year and a half, what if 90% of the media were attacking Chairman Soong, and even your beloved Sister Wan-Shui, with 100% of the internet blackening your name—accusing you of drinking and embracing women, attacking your father-in-law, calling you a gangster, a rogue, claiming your children weren't yours, attacking all of your father-in-law's real estate, and attacking whether Sister Wan-Shui interfered in politics during your time as Taiwan Provincial Governor? If you were attacked continuously for a year and a half, would you speak like this today? Seeing me attacked and beaten, you call for me to be poised and respect the media. Chairman Soong, it seems easy to watch others take a beating. Has Taiwan's decades of democratic politics ever been this dirty, this vile, in the 2020 election? Vice Presidential candidate Lai Ching-te, from the DPP, is sitting right here—bear witness! What were you called by the online army in April and May of this year? Weren't you begging for mercy?"
        </div>

        <div class="candidate-line soong">
            <span class="speaker" style="color: #FFA500;">James Soong (Deep and lamenting):</span>
            "Mayor Han, since childhood, my father told me, and my grandmother taught him, that the Gods are watching three feet above your head. I govern with this belief: politics is a business of conscience. Politics must truly care for the suffering of the people. It is good to practice virtue in public service. Frankly speaking, man acts, Heaven watches. In fact, step by step, the people will not forget the efforts you have made. Travel anywhere in Taiwan, and everyone knows that those road signs were initiated by James Soong; if you have an urgent need for the toilet on the highway, the initiative to start building restrooms at all gas stations was also begun by James Soong. The small matters of the people are the great matters of the government; the government must not treat them lightly."
        </div>

        <h2>The Solitude of the Rational Observer and the Adherence to Chinese Identity</h2>
        
        <p>
            Soong knew that his words were merely insignificant noise to the ears of the fervent Blue and Green voters. His voice represented the rejected path of rational centrism.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            When the camera focused on him, he let out a final, desperate cry: “Fellow citizens, my loyalty to the Republic of China is beyond doubt! My <span class='highlight'>Chinese identity</span> is built upon an appreciation for the culture, history, and shared heritage. This sentiment has never conflicted with my deep love for Taiwan. I urge everyone: stop being held hostage by the ideologies of the Blue and Green camps, and step out of this <span class='highlight'>swamp of fate</span>!”
        </p>
        
        <p>
            He tried to reach out, as if to grasp the audience's attention, but the spotlights were too bright; all he saw were blurry figures. A deep sorrow washed over him: for twenty years, he had been here, running relentlessly like Sisyphus pushing his boulder, simply to prove that the <span class='highlight'>mandate that fell short</span> in 2000 was not extinguished.
        </p>

        <h2>The Echo of History: An Eternal Commemoration</h2>
        
        <p>
            He slowly returned to his seat and closed his eyes. Only the voices of Tsai and Han remained, merging into a continuous drone. He no longer viewed this as an election, but as an <span class='highlight'>eternal commemoration</span> of his own political life.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Ma Ying-jeou's victories (2008, 2012) proved the consolidation of the Pan-Blue forces, while Tsai Ing-wen's success (2016, seeking re-election in 2020) established the dominance of local identity. Soong's existence became the <span class='highlight'>beginning and the footnote</span> to all of it. Had he won in 2000, perhaps Taiwan would not have experienced such drastic party rotations, nor such distinctly divided Blue and Green walls.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But history was fixed. Beneath his feet lay the trajectory of twenty years of Taiwanese politics, filled with missed opportunities, regret, and endless bickering. He opened his eyes, wearing the <span class='highlight'>calm composure of an old statesman who had seen it all</span>, transcending victory and defeat. He would finish this fight, not for the win, but to prove: he was here, and he had offered a better choice.

            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.1em; opacity: 0.9; margin-bottom: 40px; color: #ffccbc;"><em>"We aimed for the stars, but gravity is a cruel mistress. The system is broken, but it is still strong enough to keep us out."</em></p>

            <p>The rain falling on Taipei is quiet tonight. It does not drum with the fury of a storm, nor does it wash away the sins of the city. It simply falls, steady and cold, soaking the few remaining orange flags that lie abandoned on the sidewalk of Ren'ai Road. Inside the headquarters of the "New Taiwanese Service Team," the mood is not one of outrage, but of a deep, exhausting melancholy. It is the atmosphere of a party that has gone on too long, where the music has stopped but the guests are too tired to leave.</p>
            
            <p>You, <strong>James Soong</strong>, stand before the television monitors. You are the "Governor." The man who defied the establishment. The man who promised a Third Way. But the numbers on the screen do not lie, and they do not flatter. You have secured <strong>${quickstats[1].toFixed(1)}%</strong> of the vote. It is a respectable number. It is enough to defeat the official Kuomintang candidate, <strong>Lien Chan</strong>, who languishes in third place. But it is not enough to challenge <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong>. It is not even close.</p>
            
            <p>In the silence of your private office, you face the hard truth: The "Soong Wave" hit a breakwater. You thought you could sweep the island. You thought the people were ready to abandon the old party loyalties entirely. But you underestimated the Machine. You underestimated the stickiness of the KMT's "Iron Votes," even when led by a weak candidate. And perhaps, you overestimated your own invincibility.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chang Chao-hsiung</strong>, your running mate, sits on the sofa, removing his glasses to rub his tired eyes. "The Xing Piao (Chung Hsing Bills) scandal," he murmurs, staring at the floor. "It stuck, Governor. We tried to explain it. We tried to sue. But the mud stuck. The middle class... they stayed home. Or they went back to the KMT."</p>
            
            <p>You nod slowly. <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong> knew what he was doing. The old fox in the Presidential Palace didn't need to destroy you completely; he just needed to damage you enough to keep you under 35%. He painted you as corrupt, as a man of the "Old Era," and despite your 309 township visits, despite your sweat and tears, enough voters believed him. They looked at you and saw a defecting warlord rather than a savior.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chen Wan-shui</strong> walks in, holding a cup of ginseng tea. She looks frail. The campaign has aged her. She places the tea on your desk and touches your hand. "You still beat the Party, Chu-yu," she says softly, trying to find a silver lining. "You ran as an independent and you beat the KMT. That has never happened before."</p>
            
            <p>"But A-Bian won," you reply, your voice raspy. "And he won clearly."</p>
            
            <p>This is the bitterest pill. If the vote had been closer, if you had reached 40%, you could claim a moral victory. You could claim that you were robbed by the split. But at <strong>${quickstats[1].toFixed(1)}%</strong>, the narrative changes. You are not the "Uncrowned King." You are simply the spoiler. The history books will record that James Soong split the conservative vote, handed the presidency to the independence movement, and failed to build a majority coalition of his own.</p>
            
            <p>You look at the map on the wall. It is not the sea of orange you dreamed of. You won the solid blue districts, yes. You took the Hakka belt. But the South is deep Green. And the North... the North is a fractured mess of Blue and Orange. You didn't unite the opposition; you merely divided it.</p>
            
            <p>The phone rings. It is a call from a KMT elder, one of the few who still speaks to you. "The Chairman is resigning," the voice says. "Lee Teng-hui is out. The party is in ruins. We need to talk about... reunification."</p>
            
            <p>You hang up. The vultures are already circling. They want you back. Not as a leader, but as a prodigal son returning to save the family estate. They want your votes, but they don't want <em>you</em>. They will blame you for the loss. They will say, <em>"If Soong hadn't run, Lien would have won."</em> They will ignore the fact that Lien was a disastrous candidate. They will pin the "Sinner of History" label on your chest and ask you to wear it with pride.</p>
            
            <p>You step out into the main hall. The staff looks at you with a mixture of love and pity. There are no riots tonight. There is no anger at the gates. Just a profound sense of "what might have been." The energy of the rallies—the "fever" that gripped the island—has broken.</p>
            
            <p>You walk onto the balcony. The crowd is smaller than you expected. The die-hards are there, waving their flags, but the casual voters have already gone home to watch the new President-elect on TV. You grip the podium. You have to be strong for them. You have to pretend that this is a beginning, not an end.</p>
            
            <p>"My friends," you say, your voice echoing in the wet night air. "We have walked a lonely road."</p>
            
            <p>"We stood up against the giants!" you shout, trying to inject fire into the cold ashes. "We proved that a man without a party can still shake the foundations of the Republic!"</p>
            
            <p>The crowd cheers, but it is a polite cheer. They know. They know the revolution stalled.</p>
            
            <p>"Mr. Chen has won," you acknowledge, and the boos are half-hearted. "But we are not going away. We will form a new party! A <strong>People First Party</strong>! We will be the watchdog in the legislature! We will ensure that the Republic of China is safe!"</p>
            
            <p>But as you speak the words, you feel the hollowness of them. A "Third Party" in Taiwan's system is a difficult beast. Without the presidency, without the resources of the state, how long can you keep this movement together? How long before your supporters drift back to the KMT or accept the DPP reality?</p>
            
            <p>You look toward the Presidential Palace. The lights are blazing. A-Bian is preparing his victory speech. He will speak of a "New Era." And you? You are the ghost of the era that just passed. You successfully killed the KMT's dominance, but you died in the effort.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chen Wan-shui</strong> stands in the shadows, watching you. You realize that she is the only thing you have truly won in this election. The loyalty of the people is fleeting; the loyalty of family is absolute.</p>
            
            <p>You finish your speech and wave to the crowd. You step back inside, away from the glare of the lights. The "Soong Wave" has receded, leaving you stranded on the beach, looking at a wreckage that is partly of your own making. You are the second most powerful man in Taiwan, in a system that only cares about the first.</p>

                    The late founder of the People First Party, Mr. James Chu-yu Soong, was innately brilliant and possessed <span class='highlight'>profound political foresight</span>. He entered public service early, demonstrating competence in both civil and military affairs, and held key central government posts, including Director-General of the Government Information Office and Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, where he <span class='highlight'>outlined the national image</span> and ensured policy implementation, making notable achievements. Most significantly, during his tenure as Chairman and the last popularly elected Governor of Taiwan Province, he <span class='highlight'>personally traveled to every county and township, working diligently at the grassroots level</span>, promoting the ideal of the "New Taiwanese" and completing major infrastructure projects such as highway networks, water resource centers, and sanitation facilities. His <span class='highlight'>governance was distinguished, earning wide acclaim</span>, the moniker of "Super Governor," and laying a robust foundation for Taiwan's local autonomy and modernization.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
                    In later years, despite political vicissitudes, he resolutely founded the People First Party, committing himself to constitutional democracy and <span class='highlight'>adhering steadfastly to centrist ideals</span>. Though he ran for the presidency multiple times and <span class='highlight'>never achieved ultimate success, his persistence in ideals and concern for the nation’s destiny were truly exceptional</span> and served as a lasting example. His lifelong endeavor was marked by taking national responsibility upon himself, <span class='highlight'>working tirelessly with unwavering loyalty</span>, his contributions to the development of democratic constitutionalism are most profound. Upon learning of his passing, the government expresses deep sorrow and hereby issues this official Commendation Order to show the nation’s profound respect for this distinguished elder.

            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.1em; opacity: 0.8; margin-bottom: 40px; color: #ffcc80;"><em>"The lion fought the tiger, and while they bled, the sloth walked slowly to the throne."</em></p>

            <p>The mood inside the "New Taiwanese Service Team" headquarters is not one of tragedy, but of disgust. It is the sour, bile-tasting feeling of watching a rigged game play out exactly as the house intended. The rain outside is washing away the orange confetti that will never be fired. Inside, your staff are smashing phones, cursing the television screens, and weeping with rage.</p>
            
            <p>You, <strong>James Soong</strong>, sit in your office, staring at the numbers that defy all logic, all passion, and all justice.</p>
            
            <p><strong>1. Lien Chan (KMT) - ELECTED</strong><br>
            <strong>2. James Soong (Independent)</strong><br>
            <strong>3. Chen Shui-bian (DPP)</strong></p>
            
            <p>You have lost. But you didn't lose to the "Green Terror." You didn't lose to the independence movement. You lost to <strong>Lien Chan</strong>. You lost to a man who cannot read a speech without stuttering, a man who has never walked through a muddy rice paddy in his life, a man whose approval ratings were in the single digits just months ago.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chang Chao-hsiung</strong>, your running mate, is pacing the room, his face purple with fury. "It was the Fear Card," he spits out. "It was the goddamn Stability Card. The voters... they panicked. The missiles, the stock market threats... they looked at A-Bian and saw war. They looked at you and saw uncertainty. So they ran back to Mommy. They ran back to the KMT."</p>
            
            <p>He is right. The "Dump-Save" (棄保) effect happened, but in the most twisted way possible. The voters didn't dump Lien to save you. They dumped <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong> to save the Republic, and they dumped <strong>You</strong> to save the Party. The "Iron Votes" that you thought you had stolen? They returned to the mothership in the final 48 hours. The local factions you thought you had bought? They took the KMT's money and delivered the votes to Lien.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chen Wan-shui</strong> sits beside you, holding your hand. She looks relieved that it's over, but sad for the injustice of it. "They chose safety, Chu-yu," she says softly. "They are good people, but they are scared people. Lee Teng-hui knew how to scare them."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong>. The old man in the Palace. You can imagine him now, sipping his tea, a small, victorious smile on his lips. He did it. He pulled off the impossible. He destroyed you without handing the country to the DPP. He proved that the KMT Machine—the hundreds of billions of dollars, the military, the intelligence agencies, the local patronage networks—is stronger than any one man. He proved that charisma is nothing compared to organization.</p>
            
            <p>You look at the TV. <strong>Lien Chan</strong> is on stage. He looks stiff, awkward, almost surprised to be there. He is reading a victory speech that sounds like a bureaucratic report. There is no fire. There is no vision. It is the victory of the status quo. The "Leviathan" has swallowed the election whole.</p>
            
            <p>And <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong>? He is finished. A distant third. The independence movement has been crushed, exposed as a minority faction that terrified the middle class into the arms of the KMT. In a way, you have been vindicated—you warned that A-Bian was dangerous. But the voters didn't trust you to stop him; they trusted the Machine.</p>
            
            <p>A senior aide walks in, looking defeated. "Governor, the crowd is waiting. But... they are angry. They want to march on KMT headquarters. They are shouting that the election was rigged."</p>
            
            <p>"It <em>was</em> rigged," you mutter, standing up. "Not with stuffed ballot boxes, but with stuffed brains. They brainwashed the electorate with fear."</p>
            
            <p>You straighten your orange tie. You have to go out there. You have to tell the millions of people who believed in the "Third Way" that the "Old Way" has won. You have to tell them that the revolution has been cancelled because the people decided they preferred their chains.</p>
            
            <p>You step out onto the balcony. The cheers are loud, but they are desperate. <em>"Song Zongtong! Song Zongtong!"</em></p>
            
            <p>You look out at the sea of orange flags, now drooping in the rain. You realize that this was your one chance. You broke the KMT, you forced them to their knees, and yet, they stood back up. The structure was too deep. The roots were too old.</p>
            
            <p>"My friends!" you shout, your voice filled with a bitter defiance.</p>
            
            <p>"Tonight, the establishment has won a victory of numbers, but not of hearts!"</p>
            
            <p>The crowd roars, feeding on your anger.</p>
            
            <p>"They used their money! They used their lies! They used their threats! And they managed to convince the people that mediocrity is better than excellence!"</p>
            
            <p>You point a finger toward the KMT headquarters in the distance. "Lien Chan may sit in that chair," you declare, "but he sits on a throne of lies! He is a President of the Party, not a President of the People!"</p>
            
            <p>But as you speak, you feel the cold reality settling in. The KMT has survived. You are now the leader of a splinter faction. You are Second Place. The Kingmaker who failed to make himself King.</p>
            
            <p>You turn to Wan-shui. "Let's go home," you whisper. "The country has chosen to sleep for another four years."</p>
            
            <p>The KMT sun still shines, but it is a pale, cold light. And you are left standing in the shadows, the most talented politician of your generation, defeated by a man who barely campaigned.</p>

        <h3>▶ The Inevitable Cost of Integration: The Broken Legacy of the Lien-Soong Alliance</h3>
        <p>
            When Lien Chan narrowly won the presidency in 2000, with James Soong finishing second, the fragility of the Pan-Blue coalition's integration predetermined the outcome of this power game. However, the animosity between President Ma Ying-jeou and Mr. Soong did not start with the coalition's formation, but with the <strong>'Fake Poll Rōnin' incident that shaped the 2000 election</strong>. Mr. Soong’s camp viewed then-Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou’s critical pre-election statements and alleged polling manipulation as the <strong>'Original Sin'</strong> for Soong's defeat. This fissure has never truly healed.
        </p>
        <p>
            To secure his re-election in 2004, Lien Chan had to incorporate Soong as his running mate. The Lien-Soong ticket successfully defeated the DPP, achieving Pan-Blue unity, but it passed the irreconcilable conflict between Ma Ying-jeou and James Soong to the next administration.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2008, Ma Ying-jeou took the reins. To co-opt Soong’s administrative faction and huge grassroots support, President Ma appointed Soong as Premier in January 2009. However, the breakdown was swift and painful. Policy clashes between the Presidential Office and the Executive Yuan, combined with President Ma's deep suspicion of Mr. Soong's high personal popularity, ultimately forced Soong to resign the Premiership in just over a year, descending into obscurity.
        </p>

        <h3>▶ 2013: The Bloody Conflict in the Legislature</h3>
        <p>
            After two years of silence, President Ma won re-election in 2012. To placate Soong, and to place him in a position that was seemingly high but inherently constrained, Soong was appointed President of the Legislative Yuan through the proportional representation list. This was viewed externally as the final attempt at 'peaceful coexistence within the system.'
        </p>
        <p>
            However, in September 2013, this fragile façade was shattered by the Ma administration itself.
        </p>
        
        <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #CC0000; padding-left: 15px; margin: 20px 0; font-style: italic; background-color: #FFF0F0;">
            “This network has learned exclusively that the Presidential Office, utilizing the Special Investigation Unit (SIU), has obtained wiretap evidence suggesting Speaker Soong Chu-yu used his influence to 'peddle influence' (關說) for local factional figures in judicial cases. The Presidential Office believes Speaker Soong’s style of conduct severely compromises judicial independence and the government's clean image.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Although the Presidential Office claims its actions were aimed at 'defending clean governance,' political observers view this as a naked 'purge of power.' President Ma used his executive authority to decisively eliminate Soong—whom he viewed as his greatest threat—from the core political circle.
        </p>

        <h3>▶ Political Aftermath: The Future of the PFP</h3>
        <p>
            This incident not only marks the climax of the personal feud between Ma and Soong but also signals the complete collapse of the 'Pan-Blue integration' initiated in 2000. While the KMT has secured the right to govern, it now faces an openly split political landscape. Will Soong Chu-yu and his PFP faction choose total confrontation? Will they become the KMT’s greatest spoiler force in the next election?
        </p>
        <p>
            Taiwanese politics, after ten years of tug-of-war between Ma and Soong, proves once again that <strong>power is always the most brutal touchstone in the political arena</strong>.

            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.1em; opacity: 0.8; margin-bottom: 40px; color: #bcaaa4;"><em>"We thought we were the storm. It turns out we were just the fog, blown away by the first wind of fear."</em></p>

            <p>The campaign headquarters of the "New Taiwanese Service Team" is not a place of mourning tonight. Mourning implies a loss of something living. This room feels like an archaeological dig—a place where something ancient and dead has been uncovered. The orange flags, once waved with such fanatical zeal, are now piled in corners like trash. The staff are not running; they are sitting in chairs, staring at the walls, catatonic with shock.</p>
            
            <p>You, <strong>James Soong</strong>, sit alone in your office. The door is closed, but it cannot shut out the truth. The truth is glowing on the small television screen on your desk, mocking you with its cold, digital certainty.</p>
            
            <p><strong>1. Lien Chan (KMT) - ELECTED</strong><br>
            <strong>2. Chen Shui-bian (DPP)</strong><br>
            <strong>3. James Soong (Independent)</strong></p>
            
            <p><strong>Third.</strong></p>
            
            <p>You whisper the word, tasting the ashes on your tongue. You are not the President. You are not the Runner-up. You are the loser. You have finished behind the man you called incompetent (Lien) and the man you called dangerous (Chen). The "Soong Wave" that terrified the establishment for six months has crashed against the rocks and vanished without a trace.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chang Chao-hsiung</strong>, your running mate, looks like a man who has aged ten years in ten hours. He pours a glass of water, his hand shaking so badly that half of it spills onto the table. "They went back," Chang whispers, his voice devoid of hope. "The voters... they went back. The 'Iron Votes' returned to the party. The 'Dump-Soong' (棄宋) strategy... it worked perfectly."</p>
            
            <p>You close your eyes, and the realization hits you like a physical blow. You underestimated the <strong>Machine</strong>. You underestimated the sheer, gravitational pull of the Kuomintang. For fifty years, the KMT *was* the state. And when the moment of truth came—when the voters looked at the abyss of a Chen Shui-bian presidency—they didn't trust the maverick independent to save them. They trusted the Brand. They trusted the Flag. They trusted the Emblem.</p>
            
            <p>You think of <strong>Ma Ying-jeou</strong>. The "Golden Boy." The assassin with the smile. His release of the "Fake Polls" claiming you were collapsing wasn't just a dirty trick; it was a self-fulfilling prophecy. He told the voters you couldn't win, and because they believed him, they stopped supporting you, ensuring you couldn't win. It was a masterclass in psychological warfare.</p>
            
            <p>And <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong>? The old man in the Palace must be laughing so hard his ribs hurt. He played the ultimate game of 4D chess. He knew that by creating a crisis, by raising the tensions with China, by making the election about "Survival" rather than "Reform," the electorate would retreat to the safety of the KMT bunker. He sacrificed his popularity to save the party's grip on power. He destroyed you, his rebellious son, by turning the family against you.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chen Wan-shui</strong> sits beside you. She is the only person in the room who is not crying. She is angry. "They are cowards, Chu-yu," she says, her voice hard. "The people you served... the people whose roads you paved... they abandoned you. As soon as the KMT blew the whistle, they ran back to the master."</p>
            
            <p>You look at the map on the wall. It is a sea of Blue. Lien Chan has swept the North, the Center, the East. He has reclaimed the "Iron Villages." Even in the places where you drew crowds of fifty thousand people, the actual votes went to Lien. The crowds came for the show; they voted for the system.</p>
            
            <p>The television cuts to the <strong>KMT Headquarters</strong>. It is a coronation. <strong>Lien Chan</strong> stands there, stiff, boring, utterly uninspiring. He looks like a statue that has been wheeled onto the stage. He is the President-elect not because he is loved, not because he is capable, but because he is the Chair of the Board. The KMT machine realized that if they split, A-Bian would win. So they ruthlessly, efficiently cannibalized your support to feed the official candidate.</p>
            
            <p>And <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong>? He is second. A strong second. He has consolidated the opposition. The country is now a two-party state: The KMT and the DPP. And you? You are the anomaly. The glitch that has been corrected.</p>
            
            <p>A young aide knocks on the door. "Governor... the press is gone. Most of them went to the KMT headquarters. There are only a few cameras left."</p>
            
            <p>This hurts more than the anger. Irrelevance. You are yesterday's news. The "Third Force" is dead on arrival.</p>
            
            <p>You stand up. You straighten your orange tie, though it feels like a noose now. You have to go out there. You have to speak to the die-hards, the few loyalists who didn't abandon you.</p>
            
            <p>You walk out to the balcony. The rain is cold. The crowd is sparse. There is no riot tonight. There is no indignation. There is only shame. The shame of people who bet on the wrong horse.</p>
            
            <p>"My friends," you say, your voice echoing in the empty street.</p>
            
            <p>"We tried to show Taiwan a new way," you continue, forcing the words out. "We tried to show that a man is more important than a party card."</p>
            
            <p>A few people clap. It sounds pathetic in the wet night air.</p>
            
            <p>"But tonight, the System has won," you admit, a moment of raw honesty that slips through the politician's mask. "The Fear has won. The people chose the devil they knew over the hope they didn't."</p>
            
            <p>You look toward the KMT headquarters, glowing in the distance. You were the Prince of that party. You were the Secretary-General. You built that machine. And tonight, it rolled over you without slowing down.</p>
            
            <p>"I accept the verdict of the people," you lie. You don't accept it. You despise it. You despise the weakness of the voters who let themselves be manipulated by Ma Ying-jeou's charts and Lee Teng-hui's threats.</p>
            
            <p>You step back from the podium. You turn to Wan-shui. "It's over," you say. "Really over."</p>
            
            <p>You are not the Kingmaker. You are not the King. You are a cautionary tale. A story parents will tell their children about what happens when you try to fight the House.</p>
            
            <p>As you walk back into the shadows of the office, you realize the cruelest joke of all: By running, you didn't destroy the KMT. You saved it. You scared the voters so much that they consolidated around Lien Chan, giving the old regime a new lease on life. You are the savior of your enemy.</p>

            The Autumn of 2025: A Campaign Forgotten by History

        <p style="text-align: right; font-style: italic; font-size: 0.9em; color: #777;">
            — A Monologue from the Old Study
        </p>

        <h3>▶ Dust-Covered Memories and a Historical Footnote</h3>
        <p>
            It is the autumn of 2025. Outside my window, President Cheng Li-wen has just begun her first term. Taiwan's politics seems to have completely settled into a stable rhythm of 'Blue-Green rotation.'
        </p>
        <p>
            I sit in my old study, the air thick with the antique scent of books and wood. I have been completely absent from the political scene for ten years. The phones are silent, my staff long scattered. All that remains is this room, filled with **my past**.
        </p>

        <h3>▶ That Perpetual Air Force Cap</h3>
        <p>
            walk to the back of the storage room and pull open a long-sealed wooden chest. Inside, the most conspicuous item is that <strong>Air Force blue campaign cap</strong>. I gently brush off the dust, my fingers tracing the brim.
        </p>
        <p>
            The year 2000. It was the most glorious, yet the most desolate year of my life. In that campaign, I traveled to every corner of Taiwan. The public's yearning for 'my style of efficiency' still feels like a burning dream. But what was the result? Lien Chan won, Chen Shui-bian was second, and I was third. My vast popularity was utterly sacrificed to the voters' 'strategic voting' effect.
        </p>
        <p>
            That defeat cost me not just the presidency but the future of my entire political faction. After Lien Chan secured re-election in 2004, the Pan-Blue camp fully integrated, treating my PFP as an outsider. By 2008, when Ma Ying-jeou was elected, I was already an irrelevant figure. My party became a <strong>failed footnote</strong> in history textbooks, used only to explain the KMT's schism.
        </p>

        <h3>▶ Flags and Former Friends</h3>
        <p>
            At the bottom of the chest lies a yellowed <strong>campaign flag</strong> with a photograph of my younger self, bearing the slogan, '<strong>Governor of Taiwan Province, the Best Choice</strong>.' How ironic. I cannot recall the last time the title of 'Governor' was publicly mentioned.
        </p>
        <p>
            I pull out a photograph: a group picture from twenty-something years ago, when we first founded the People First Party. Many of the people in the picture have since switched allegiances or retired. Even the towering figures of the past, like Lee Teng-hui—the old superior who pushed me from the core but inadvertently inspired my campaign—passed away five years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
            They are all gone. Only I remain.
        </p>

        <h3>▶ A Sigh, Twenty Years of Void</h3>
        <p>
            I return the Air Force cap to the chest and close the lid. Throughout Ma Ying-jeou's eight-year term (2008–2016) and the subsequent eight-year term of Tsai Ing-wen (2016–2024), the political ideals I represented—administrative efficiency, the technocratic style of governance—had no opportunity to flourish.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the political stage, the spotlight always follows the new actors. Over twenty-five years, the only traces I have left are the dust in this study and those forgotten flags.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em; margin-top: 30px; color: #880000;">
            I let out a long sigh. In that sound lies the ultimate, most gentle yet most cruel <strong>final judgment</strong> that Taiwanese politics has rendered upon former strongman over two decades: <strong>Forgetfulness</strong>.

This allowed the state of regional reality stability to extend to the entire Republic of China, including Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. This strategy proved effective, as in numerous Foundation simulations of the future, if ███ had not participated, the People's Republic of China would have been highly likely to conduct missile tests or directly attack Taiwan on election day. Most importantly, because of his involvement, a relatively balanced political system emerged, marked by the appearance of a two-party system.</p><p><strong>RAISA Observer ███</strong></p><hr/><p style="text-align: start;"><br></p><table style="width: auto;"><tbody><tr><th colSpan="1" rowSpan="1" width="auto"><strong>Effect Period</strong></th><th colSpan="1" rowSpan="1" width="auto"><strong>Party Affiliation</strong></th><th colSpan="1" rowSpan="1" width="auto"><strong>Presidential Candidate</strong></th><th colSpan="1" rowSpan="1" width="auto"><strong>Vice Presidential Candidate</strong></th><th colSpan="1" rowSpan="1" width="auto"><strong>Votes</strong></th><th colSpan="1" rowSpan="1" width="auto"><strong>Vote Percentage</strong></th><th colSpan="1" rowSpan="1" width="auto"><strong>Election Result</strong></th></tr><tr><td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1" width="auto">2004</td><td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1" width="auto">Kuomintang</td><td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1" width="auto">Lien Chan</td><td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1" width="auto">███</td><td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1" width="auto">6,442,452</td><td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1" width="auto">49.89%</td><td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1" width="auto">X</td></tr><tr><td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1" width="auto">2004</td><td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1" width="auto">Democratic Progressive Party</td><td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1" width="auto">Chen Shui-bian</td><td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1" width="auto">Lu Hsiu-lien</td><td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1" width="auto">6,471,970</td><td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1" width="auto">50.11%</td><td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1" width="auto">O</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Summary of Impact on Reality Stability:</strong><br><br>This election represents another case of reality stabilization, implementing various democratic processes such as vote monitoring. The challenges raised by ███'s side, including calls for the invalidation of the election and requests for a recount, repeatedly demonstrated increasing reality stability. The Hume level in the entire region reached 89, approaching the stable value of 100. In fact, even without a recount, the outcome was evident, as it was agreed that ███ functions solely as a reality-stabilizing device. If he were to become president or vice president, he would lose his effectiveness. Unlike the Vatican and the Pope, whose reality-stabilizing device (also known as the Pope) uses religion as a medium to stabilize parts of reality, ███ operates differently. He must continually run for office, continually lose, and continually traverse every inch of the land to maintain reality stability. In essence, ███ serves as a medium, with elections acting as the trigger. The outcome of the elections manifests this stability.</p><p><strong>RAISA Observer ███</strong></p><p><br></p><p style="text-align: start;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Gz7d0c0.png" alt="Gz7d0c0.png" data-href="" style="width: 707.234px;"></p><p>SCP-ZH-999-A (center) with Lin Ruei-hsiung (left) and Chin Chin-sheng (right) at a People First Party press conference.</p><h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3><p>In accordance with the "Float Operation" protocol, no containment is required for SCP-ZH-999 when it resides within SCP-ZH-999-A.

It maintains energy stability by sharing consciousness with SCP-ZH-999-A. Since its discovery in 1980, the host of SCP-ZH-999 has been Taiwanese politician James Soong (hereinafter referred to as SCP-ZH-999-A). The anomalous effects of SCP-ZH-999 exhibit a reality-stabilizing function. Beginning in 1990, every four years, SCP-ZH-999 randomly fills Hume voids within a specific range. The scope and duration of this effect are contingent upon SCP-ZH-999-A's political influence at the time and the magnitude of reality negative values within the affected area.</p><p>The origin of SCP-ZH-999 and its potential connection to the Type III anomalous energy aggregate associated with the Pope in the Vatican remain unknown. Beyond insights from the ZH-999 Observation Head, Lee Teng-hui, the mechanism by which SCP-ZH-999 transfers between individuals is also unclear. Following the death of former President Lee Teng-hui, the Foundation has initiated a re-evaluation of the project, focusing on SCP-ZH-999-A. This effort is led by Huang Shan-shan, head of the Effect Impact Department.</p><p>Post-2020, the Foundation entered into an agreement with SCP-ZH-999-A to repurpose SCP-ZH-999 for suppressing specific anomalous phenomena or restoring localized reality, rather than stabilizing the broader Taiwan Strait reality. Additionally, the Foundation is actively assisting SCP-ZH-999-A in identifying a suitable successor host for SCP-ZH-999.</p><h3>Addendum 1:</h3><p><strong>[Authorized Access]</strong></p><p><strong>Interview Transcript:</strong></p><blockquote>Head: I’m sorry, but we’ve finally decided to archive you. <br>SCP-ZH-999-A: Archive what about me? Who authorized this? Head: It’s the conclusion from above, Chairman. <br>SCP-ZH-999-A: You’re going to assign me a number? <br>Head: I’m afraid so. <br>SCP-ZH-999-A: You’re going to deprive me of my personal freedom. Head: Chairman, you are still free. SCP-ZH-999-A: Yes, but our freedoms have different meanings.<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/q00b5XO.jpg" alt="" data-href="" style="width: 259.00px;height: 347.50px;"/><br><strong>SCP-ZH-999-A Designated Portrait</strong></blockquote><blockquote>SCP-ZH-999-A: I think I can request something. <br>Head: You can make a request. As someone who has long cooperated with the Float Operation, I believe the Foundation will try to accommodate you. <br>SCP-ZH-999-A: I hope you agree to this first. Head: Chairman… SCP-ZH-999-A: Agree to the photo first; I want to change it to this one. <br>Head: I think that’s fine, just the photo… <br>SCP-ZH-999-A: Also, since you often say that I am who I am, I want to do this from "my standpoint." <br>Head: What do you mean, Chairman? <br>SCP-ZH-999-A: I want to use my methods and my perspective to write the story of me and this thing. Simply put, you want to assign me a number, but I want to handle this project myself. Head: But you’re not a professional… <br>SCP-ZH-999-A: But politics is my profession, and currently, you still need me as a tool, don’t you? After all these years, I hope to be treated as I deserve.</blockquote></div>`)

Welcome to Astro's Variable Headquarters
This is a fairly simple function you can add to your mods. It will create a little menu in which the player can view the numbers laid out within the functions.
This is a great way to give the player a little more information about your mod.

Across this code, you will find a lot of aspects you can edit. I have left plenty of comments to help you understand what each part does.
Don't be afraid to ask in #mod-help on the Discord for clarification or help with editing this code.

To use this, place this code below your Code 2, and edit it as needed. You can duplicate the 'let a = document.createElement('p');' section to add more lines of text.

Functions are referenced in text like so: ' + function + '. This will display the number from the function in the text.
Credit to Nina, who made the original code that summoned the new screen (originally for the 1960Red/1952Blue advisor screen)
Go ahead and use this code in your mods - just give me credit. I hope it helps you out!
