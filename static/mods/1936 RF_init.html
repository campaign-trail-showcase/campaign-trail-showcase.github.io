The 43-year-old former governor of Texas is set to become the youngest president since Theodore Roosevelt, and the first of the American party since it's creation in 1930. Running mate Alben Barkley, a longtime Senator from Kentucky, is set to become the Vice President. </p>\n\n<p> In a speech in Austin before hundreds of raving supporters, Governor Moody promised a return to stability and prosperity, saying \" We stand at a new dawn in America\" </p>\n\n<p>Senator Bronson Cutting and Father James Renshaw Cox have both reportedly sent telegrams congratulating Governor Moody on his victory.

In a speech to reporters at his home in Austin, the former governor and presidential candidate stated \"The situation has developed not necessarily to our advantage. I do not wish to continue the campaign further.\" Moody was polling at around 12 percent of the vote in the primary elections, which are currently being contested by incumbent Senator and former governor \"Pappy\" O'Daniel and another former governor, James V. Allred. So far, Moody has yet to publicly endorse any candidate in this tightly contested race </p>\n\n<p> Moody captured public attention with his unsuccessful 1936 campaign for President on the American party ticket. Moody has remained a staunch critic of his former Republican opponent's policies, specifically President Cutting's policies, decrying his repeal of the 18th Amendment and criticizing many of the federal programs created by his administration. With Moody's attempted return to politics after about a decade in the private sector foiled, it seems his lofty political career has all but drawn to a close.</P>\n<p> The Republicans have held on to control of the Senate since 1936, but early polls are showing the American Party ahead in many key races, such as in Montana, Colorado, and New Jersey. The Progressive Pact is also looking to make gains in Michigan and Ohio. The slowly rebounding economy, Cutting's support for Britain and Germany in the Franco-German War and the response to the South American refugee crisis are ultimately what will determine whether or not the GOP will retain the Senate. </p>\n\n",

The last time the election was decided by congress was in the election of 1824, in which the House elected John Quincy Adams, despite Andrew Jackson winning the most electoral votes. Many have expressed their concerns at a similar occurrence in this year's contingent election, as strong performances down ballot for the JPP has led to a deadlocked senate and a house majority for the American party of only one seat. \"It looks like another corrupt bargain is in the cards\" Representative Samuel Rayburn of Texas told the Times. </p>\n\n",

The Crash of TWA Flight 13 in Newark killed 12 people, including Senators Royal Copeland and Harry S. Truman. In his report, Committee Chair Bronson M. Cutting of New Mexico claimed that Bureau mismanagement resulted in the crash. For their part, has dismissed the claims as spurious, and insists that the bureau's management was up to proper protocol and environmental conditions and errors in judgement from both airport  and pilot are at fault. Senator Cutting also implored President Moody to increase oversight of air travel in the wake of this disaster. Between this investigation and the prominent role he played in the Ford Hearings, Senator Cutting has certainly boosted his national profile, which many suspect could be in preparation for another campaign for president in 1940.</p>",
            "no_electoral_majority_message": "<h3>2/5/37 - WILKIE BECOMES CARETAKER PRESIDENT AS CONTINGENT ELECTION LOOMS.</h3><p>Yesterday, President Andrew Mellon stepped down, becoming the first President in American history to leave office before the Mellon announced his decision on Monday, in a nationally broadcast speech, citing his ailing health. In his speech, the president revealed he had been  diagnosed with cancer last November, a fact the White House has largely remained quiet about, and stated “To tell the truth, I can no longer perform the duties of my office to the best of my ability, and therefore it is in the best interest of our country that vacate the office for someone who will”. America’s oldest President leaves office highly unpopular, amid economic crises and growing unrest, as well as a public perception of being apathetic. Vice President Wendell Willkie was sworn in at noon, becoming the 32nd president of the United States. His term will likely not be long, as he is set to be replaced in March by the winner of the contingent election, which at the moment seems to be a toss up between Governor Moody and Senator Cutting.</p>",

A man from working class origins, Cox worked as steelworker, a newsie and a cab driver before being ordained to the priesthood in 1911. Cox has made it his mission to help the poor. His charitable efforts and his radio sermons preaching the biblical virtues of charity has made him a beloved figure in Western Pennsylvania. In 1932, fed up with the government's indifference in the face of the depression, Cox lead a march 20,000 strong to Washington to demand the government take action. While his pleas to the White House were met with indifference, he certainly turned heads, and when he announced his candidacy on the Jobless Party Ticket,  voters rallied behind him. Now, he stands as the Candidate for the Jobless Progressive Party, a shaky leftist coalition of progressives, unionists, socialists and communists. While he may be unlikely to win, his backing amongst the working class voters has terrified big business and raised red flags in both parties. Keeping his coalition together will be crucial for Cox to have any chance at victory. <b>Not Playable yet</p>",

As a blue-collar engineer in New York, he would join forces with the IWW as head of their Bureau of Industrial Research, before eventually founding Technocracy Inc in 1932. Scott dreams of a world where monetary value is replaced with energy value, where scientists and engineers rule instead of elected politicians, and where everything is perfectly socially engineered. This dream so far has been just that, as his 1932 campaign for president was a dead on arrival.  From the disaster that were his campaign speeches to being ridiculed from across the political spectrum for his zany ideas, it seemed the like Technocracy was done and over with. However, with the economy in shambles and discontent reaching a boiling point, there has never been a better time to convince people to abandon such sacrosanct things like democracy and capitalism.  <b>Not Playable yet</p>",
