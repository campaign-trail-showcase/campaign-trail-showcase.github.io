Tilden emerged victorious over Rutherford B. Hayes, despite claims that intimidation and fraud saved him in the South. As president, he has overseen the end of Reconstruction, a steady recovery of the economy from the Panic, and a reduction of Chinese immigration. But on his signature issue of corruption, Tilden has struggled to make progress. After Hayes went down in defeat, Senator Roscoe Conkling and his Stalwart faction seized the reins of the Republican party, with Conkling leading the Senate in obstructing Tilden's proposed reforms. As tensions grow between the two parties, the nation prepares to choose its next leader.</p><p><ul><li>Senator Roscoe Conkling, the challenger, will have to defend his opposition to reform and find a way to seize states Tilden won four years ago.</li><li>President Samuel Tilden will need to defend his record and use it to convince wary Northerners to entrust a Democrat with the Executive Mansion once more.</li></ul></p><p>Tilden, as a relatively popular incumbent, is favored, but there are few men in the country more charismatic, cunning, and confident than Senator Conkling. This election will center around civil rights enforcement in the South, civil service reform, and the economy. Here begins a new story of America, diverted from its path by fate, with dire consequences for the nation and its people.</p><br><p><i>In real life, a combination of chance events and Conkling's own ego derailed his career and relegated him, once a titan of American politics, to relative obscurity, his once-massive influence  forgotten. The Half-Breed Hayes prevailed in a close election and began building support for anti-corruption measures. After the assassination of the reformist Garfield, Conkling's trusted protégé Chester Arthur turned on the Stalwarts and went on to champion civil service reform. Conkling lost his Senate seat, returned to private practice, and died after a stubborn trek through a snowstorm. The Hyperion series will examine one of the biggest what-ifs in American history -- the story of how one of post-Civil War America's most imposing men came to inherit the Presidency.</i><p>I've selected three songs for the soundtrack:</p><ul><li>The 'Battle Hymn of the Republic,' a patriotic song associated with the Union during the Civil War, here performed by the United States Army Field Band,</li><li>'Tilden and Reform,' a pro-Tilden song during his 1876 campaign, performed here by Howard da Silva on <i>Politics and Poker</i>, a 1960 cover album of political songs, and</li><li>The second movement of John Knowles Paine's second symphony, <i>In Spring</i>, which premiered in Boston in 1880 and is performed here by the New York Philarmonic.
