Everyone has an opinion about the issue, and almost nobody wants to admit those who oppose their proposal can even do so in good faith. Those in strict opposition, the evangelicals, hardliners, conservatives, and ever-concerned suburbanites, view it as nothing less than a debauched satanic desecration of the nation’s most prized values, that of the traditional, heterosexual picket fence family. Those on the opposite side, the homosexuals, the leftists, urbanites and progressive malcontents view it as nothing more than the barest symbol of pure equality, and anything less as pure bigotry. Standing in the middle are the compromisers, the new democrats, and undecideds, just wanting the heat to go down, tending to favor civil unions rather than going for marriage. A majority of Americans are anti-gay marriage, and moderates and conservatives alike would applaud you for pushing forward with the Republicans’ Defense of Marriage Act, banning gay marriage nationally, but never underestimate Clinton’s ability to subsume and neutralize issues with a magic grin.",

        <h3 class="endingtitle">A New Contract</h3>
        <h2 class="endingdate">November 3rd 1998</h2>
        <p>“How are we holding Dennis?” Newt couldn’t even face the screen. The threat of being relegated to a piddling 1-term president, with all the tepid, meager respect that comes with that, made him sick to his stomach. Counterfactuals kept popping in his head. What if. What could happen, what could they make of me? An effigy? Something to be paraded around as some symbol of some deep sickness in the nation. It was all too possible. Midterms are often that way. They were for Clinton. Silence surrounded him. He didn’t even keep his wife for accompaniment, too much drama. Dennis didn’t speak, and neither did Newt. He just sat there in a dark room, with its harsh blacks and whites reflected across the oval, the bits of moonlight shining through.</p>
        <p>Hastert’s voice gained an unsteady confidence. After what felt like an hour of silence, he just solemnly replied, “It looks like we’re holding, at least for the most part.” Newt breathed a sigh of relief. This game of telephone really took a lot of pressure off him. It felt good to have the Speaker spoonfeed him the results, rather than worry about the intricacies.</p>
        <p>“How’s Fox?” Newt said.</p>
        <p>“It’s shaky. He’s behind half a point, but they haven’t called all precincts yet. Some of the rural areas are only about 40% counted. We could hold all seats in Pennsylvania by the end of the night. Could even gain, Toomey is ahead.” Hastert replied. Newt just smiled. So far so good. This may really be achievable. Could he defy the odds? His fear was replaced by a sense of confident bravado, as thin as it was, his heart still feeling a little bare and vulnerable. He sprawled out like a conqueror resting on his laurels after some gallant conquest of some Gallic kingdom, feet placed on a table, and shoulders placed confidently on the couch cushions. </p>
        <p>“NBC just called it for Toomey. McDade might make it, too, but he’s definitely fighting a hard fight here. It’s not looking so good for Redmond. Udall seems to be leading in New Mexico. What a shame.” Hastert continued to call them, but Newt was already beginning to write the words to his next address, proclaiming what a great victory this was. “The American people have entrusted us to another 2 years of success with a great majority in the House.” Newt quickly jotted it down in a ballpoint pen with a frayed, quick chickscratch style.</p>
        <p>“Dennis, do you ever get tired of this?” Newt asked, laughing all the way through.</p>
        <p>“Calling the races? I can stop if you want, sir.” Dennis replied.</p>
        <p>“No, no, by all means, keep going. What I mean is we think so small. Congressional politics, deadlock, PR. Fuck. It all fades in time.” Dennis was clearly drinking himself, because his next words sounded like he spat out a mouthful of liquor.</p>
        <p>“They called it for Pappas!” Hastert said with an almost youthfully exuberant tone.</p>
        <p>“Glad to hear it.”</p>
        <p>“But I do, sir. I guess that’s politics. The inevitable sands of time washed Ramses the Second away. They’ll wash us away too.” At this point, Hastert had stopped paying attention to the TV, and Newt had begun shoving a specially prepared cake for this very occasion in his mouth.</p>
        <p>“Think bigger, Denny. Some of the boys at the FedSoc have been talking, and they’ve been cooking up some good stuff. They’re talking about a new constitutional convention. We could be like the new Washington and Jefferson, think about it. An amendment to settle all these issues, to end abortion, to balance the budget, all that stuff I talked about in the Contract For America, as a permanent part of our nation’s DNA, think about it, Denny.” He washes down the cake frosting with whiskey, speaking half his words with his mouth full of cake and the other half full of whiskey.</p>
        <p>“This is a brave new world here, Mr. President.”</p>
        <p>“Damn right it is, Denny. You and I, we can change things. No more gay liberationist parades, no more hairy armed feminists, no more bullshit from the opposition. I’m going to need you to rally the troops. We have the men in Congress, but you need to wrangle them, like Hercules, you get it?”</p>
        <p>“Understood, Mr. President. It’s getting quite late. Do you need anything, sir?”</p>
        <p>“No, nothing now. Thanks, Denny. Goodnight. Oh, and Denny, you can call me Newt, just because I’m president now doesn’t mean we have to act as if we’ve never met.”</p>
        <p>“Alright, goodnight, Newt, and congratulations.”</p>

        <h3 class="endingtitle">End of a Century</h3>
        <h2 class="endingdate">December 30th 1999</h2>
        <p>The White House at night was all starkly rich whites, reds, and blacks. Newt stood at the northmost window, looking out over the White House lawn caked in glossy white snow. The thick white sheets resembled more of a soft blanket enveloping the land in its warmth than nature’s way of expressing that this was the time of year when heat itself was a commodity to be trapped and held inside lest everything succumb to an icy chill. He reached for the phone, then pulled his hands away. No reason to call Marianne. Too much drama.</p>
        <p>Jack Kennedy had his vices, so did Lyndon Johnson, so did Clinton, and so did Newt Gingrich. Callista. God, what a vice to have. So… young, refreshing, and yet, very Catholic. Whatever the religion, Newt had no qualms with Callista, and seemingly all the qualms in the world with Marianne. Not that he could divorce the First Lady of the United States? Could he? No. No, he couldn’t. That’s ridiculous. He didn’t need the house. The majority that he spent years building, Gephardt could have it as long as he had Callista.</p>
        <p>Newt glided over to the window overlooking the South lawn. He placed his fingers against the cold glass and pawed at its smooth material for just a second. The packed snow came down hard. His face in the glasses’ reflection was pale and thin, ghostly transparent, like he could even see someone enter through the thin shimmering visage of his own skin. He felt like he was waiting for someone. Some apparition that would deliver him from this lonely night and impart upon him some wisdom. For one second, it looked as if something beyond life and death was materializing from the blank slate of white and gray. But it didn’t emerge. Nothing was waiting for him across the expanse of the South lawn.</p>
        <p>He sauntered back to the Resolute, part of him somehow dejected that there was nothing there for him. That nobody is keeping track of this night alone but him. He got out a bottle of aged wine. Fuck it. No reason not to open it. He pops it open, fizz dripping down onto his hands and the carpet. It smells good. Very damn good. Not that he didn’t have more that he was sure would also smell good, but this was crisp. He doesn’t care to pour it into a glass, just drinks it from the bottle. It’s damn good wine indeed. The smell did not lie. What a beautiful, beautiful thing.</p>
        <p>There’s a brown briefcase. It’s sat there at the edge of the room, under that wooden table, since Newt moved in to the oval. He feels himself drawn to it. He cannot resist its pull. Without conscious thought, he walks over and picks it up, bringing it back to his desk. He takes a moment to brush his hands over the nice leather exterior, and without any pause, he opens it. He can’t stop the rush of emotion from seeing all these photos of him and Marianne. Photos from 83. 87. 94. The kids. God, they were so little then. The trips. The campaigns in Georgia, meeting all the people from his district for the first time. Learning the first things about how Congress worked. It all felt like it had no gravity then.</p> 
        <p>There was a tape and a tape player. He dragged it out curiously; the tape had a transparent, thin plastic shell. It didn’t say anything on it, but “play when necessary.” He popped it in with hesitation. It felt like it carried some supernatural weight. But it didn’t. Instead of some message from the beyond, all it was was George Michael. The saxophone drifted softly through the small plastic speakers. It sounded like those first years in the House. The innocent years.</p>
        <p>Returning to the photos, his eyes dotted around aimlessly, sucking up the sight of everything from his past, scuba diving, art projects, his second wedding, his first wedding. Dear god no. He averted his eyes quickly at the sight of it. He couldn’t help it. It was too much to bear, opting instead to cover it with a photo of him wearing a goofy tie. Then? He began to cry. Real, material tears. They streamed down his face, sagging heavy like bullets. He just slouched over. This was beginning to be too much for a man to bear. There has to be more to Washington life than power and lies. It didn’t come to him. This really was it.</p>

        <h3 class="endingtitle">Atlas Shrugged</h3>
        <h2 class="endingdate">November 6th 1996</h2>
        <p>Dear god. No no no no god, no. How could this happen? Gingrich was stunned. He went to bed last night dripping with anxiety at the fact that by 10 PM, they didn’t even have something close to an idea of a winner. He sat catatonically watching the television as all the talking heads said something utterly unthinkable: neither major party’s candidate was able to break 270 electoral votes. An electoral deadlock, the kind of which had never been seen before in American history. This wasn’t just odd, it was unthinkable. The models called it close, but this was… it was unbelievable.</p>
        <p>Newt felt like a small child sitting in his living room in his slacks and the shirt he wore to bed last night, listlessly spread out on the couch as if Christmas had somehow been postponed and he was left to stew in it. His mind raced with possibilities. Who do I call? Who can make this right? And more cynically, what can I do to leverage this position into victory? Whatever happened, it would be important to make sure that he came out on top, but it would be good at least, whatever happens, to customarily speak with the man in the White House and assure their mutual interest in everything going as smoothly as possible, and assuring the other that they were not scheming to empower themselves in the midst of the crisis, however true those assurances were.</p>
        <p>He picked up the phone and dialed the White House. One ring. Then another ring. Then another. Finally, an intern picks up, and Newt immediately says with an air of importance, “This is Speaker Newt Gingrich. I must speak with President Clinton about the results of last night’s election. It is imperative, and I need an immediate reply.” Tick. Tock. The clock on the wall droned on for what felt like 5 whole minutes. Newt was getting incredibly impatient with the lack of response.</p>
        <p>Then, without any fanfare, the intern replied, “Sorry, President Clinton is not taking calls at this time. Can I take a message?” with a light intonation, as if nothing out of the ordinary were happening. Newt just slammed down the phone, put on his jacket in a hurry, and grabbed the wrong car keys before grabbing the correct ones. Marianne walked into the living room to see this hurried scene of Newt trying to grab everything he could.</p>
        <p>Without hesitation, Newt spoke, “Marianne, grab everything you need for the next few days, we’re going to DC.” She followed without much to say about the matter. Neither of them knew what was happening, so naturally, words found themselves sparse and unsatisfying. In DC, the Secret Service drove them by the White House, Clinton was out front giving some sort of address as a mounting crowd of malcontents piled onto the premises. Newt rushed to the White House, but was stopped short and forced back into the car by the Secret Service.</p>
        <p>At the hotel, all Newt had was Marianne and a telephone. Marianne listened from the bedroom as Newt made call after call. All she could make out were little pieces. “A mob at the capital?” Then silence. “Call the votes!” Then silence. “I’m the damn speaker!” Then silence. She didn’t know if she cared about being first lady anymore. She just wanted this standstill period, where America was wrestling with its own divided soul, to be over and over now.</p>
        <p>The votes went down one after another. One by one. Newton Leroy Gingrich is America’s 43rd president. When he got the news, he just sat there. His eyes and Marianne’s locked. Was this the end of the chaos or just the beginning? Was this really a victory, or was this an omen of terrible things to come? America was already preparing its battlelines and talking points before the votes were even known to the public. Whatever happened for the next 4 years, in the eyes of the opposition, he was the man who stole the election. In the eyes of the party’s elders? Messy. A fuckup. Couldn’t have won it cleanly. Had to get his minions in the house to bail him out of his own failures.</p>
        <p>God save America</p>

        <h3 class="endingtitle">The Clear Sky</h3>
        <h2 class="endingdate">November 20th 1996</h2>
        <p>“Just get it,” Newt barked at the bartender. Some fucking people, fucking helpless, he thought to himself. He tapped his fingers on the table in a repetitive pattern, listlessly watching the TV. His mind and body felt torn every which way on the inside as if he had lost a loved one. Who was he anymore? He had so little left. Without the scaffolding of the path of power in place, he was just this. What he was now. A sad, aging man in a bar. </p>
        <p>He watched Clinton confidently stand in front of millions, all there to see him, to bask in his greatness. He stood straight with a confident, masculine posture, looking like a Greek god against the clear blue sky. God, he was such a presence. All he could feel was inadequacy. Like this is who the president is, this handsome, powerful man. This titan of politics effortlessly straddling coalitions and policies. Someone who could ride the stars to glory and rise above the issues of the day. He had it. The wispy something Gingrich never had. Clinton was born perfect, born to see the whole of the moon while others worked in the dark.</p>
        <p>It made Newt’s blood boil, but it made him also feel this inescapable magnetic pull, the same that everyone felt around Clinton, he surely thought. By the time Miller got to his recitation, Gingrich was already several drinks in. He wasn’t treating the bartender well, but he wasn’t treating anyone well today. He just drank and drank til Miller’s words felt more distant and distant. He was not the future. This was, hope was the future. Progress. It stung to think that everything he supported was so viscerally rejected, that he was just another one of Clinton’s many, many enemies to be stamped over.</p>
        <p>He strolled over to the payphone and slotted in the necessary quarters for a few minutes. He punched in the numbers and let it ring for a few seconds until she picked up. “Hello?” Callista said on the other end of the line.</p>
        <p>“Hey,” Newt said.</p>
        <p>“Newt?” Callista readjusted herself in her chair, crossing her legs and leaning over to put down a magazine.</p>
        <p>“Yeah.”</p>
        <p>“Where are you?”</p>
        <p>“At a payphone. At a library in DC.” Newt lied.</p>
        <p>“Have you been drinking?”</p>
        <p>“A little. Look, could I come over to your place soon?”</p>
        <p>“Not tonight. Wednesday work?”</p>
        <p>“Yeah, sure,” Newt replied, placing his forehead in his hand.</p>
        <p>“Okay. Do you need anything right now?”</p>
        <p>“No. Thanks, hun.” Newt said before placing the phone back on the hook. He sauntered out of the bar, gripping the railing to keep himself straight. Got to get a fucking grip. Sliding into the driver's seat of his car, he found himself a little dizzy. He pulled out a metal locket from his jacket. It was of his father. He thought to himself quickly that his father led a more respectable life than he did, and that maybe if he were more like him, he wouldn’t be here today. He quickly pushed the thought away and just endeavoured to remember him.</p>
        <p>As Newt drove down the boulevard, he sped faster and faster. 30 miles. 40. 50. 60. 70. He didn’t even care. Just drove. Faster and faster. Away from DC, away from Clinton. God, away from all of it. He just wanted to escape to the nearest faraway place that would accept the wreck that he was. It was cutaway turn after cutaway turn as he traveled out of DC into Maryland. Until he got to one turn. He hooked a sharp right. Oh god. He was not going to make it. He slammed on the brakes, pushing the speed back down to 60, 50, 40, 30. Before he knew it, he was sitting alone in a car, his mind and body burning, as he was sitting bumper to brick with a thick brick wall, standing still in perpetuity against a hard force.</p>

        <p>The studio environment was sterile. Everything was polished and hard, cold wood. “God, this chair is uncomfortable,” Newt thought to himself that there is nothing he would hate to do more than continue sitting here. Getting hit by a bus? Yeah, probably preferable. Contracting a serious illness and being bedridden for months before dying was only a maybe, though. He scrunched his face a little at the thought of dying in all these various gruesome ways, well, that and the chair, that is.</p>
        <p>“We’re very pleased to have you here, Mr. former speaker.” The lady in the suit says. Newt snaps his head towards the middle-aged blonde woman and her midwestern suburban accent. </p>
        <p>“Well, the pleasure is mine,” Newt says before giving a nod.</p>
        <p>“Mr. Speaker, you are known in pop culture for losing in a landslide to former President Bill Clinton. Many are in debate about the exact causes of such a blistering loss. Do you have anything to add to the conversation?” This bitch. The audacity. No, no newt. Don’t say anything rash. Just give her the generic line.</p>
        <p>“Clinton had a clear polling advantage from the very start. It was just a good year for him, that’s all.”</p>
        <p>“Is there anything you think you could have done differently?” God. Please change the subject. Please.</p>
        <p>“Not particularly. I think that Clinton just had something of a messaging monopoly, and breaking that would be extremely hard. It underscores the importance of an information ecosystem where conservatives can tell truth to power.”</p>
        <p>“Very true, Mr. Gingrich. Do you want to speak more about the subject?</p>
        <p>“Sure. As it stands, liberals have been running the media for decades. A Democrat president could say that black is white, and the media would run stories about how it’s true. Have you ever noticed that? I mean, it’s paramount to treason the amount of lies the mainstream media has fed Americans. You can’t tell the truth anywhere. They’re all afraid of the truth. On these new social media platforms, they love to take down conservative pages.”</p>
        <p>“Thank you, Mr. Gingrich. Do you ever intend to run for president again, under perhaps better circumstances?”</p>
        <p>“Oh no, not anymore. I almost sat it out in 96. I was myself rather skeptical if I could go all the way. Maybe in another world I would run this year, but not this one.”</p>
        <p>“On the topic of this year’s election, what do you think of Pennsylvania Senator Santorum’s victory in the Republican primary?”</p>
        <p>“I was one of his biggest supporters during the primary, and I am ecstatic that he is this year’s nominee. He has my full support, completely. He and I agree on virtually everything. He’s a true patriot and conservative. He represents, I think, a divergence from the pithy, weak pseudoconservatism we saw with Spector that lost him the 00 election. Spector gave up all the ground possible, and we saw conservative patriots reject him in return. Americans are tired of liberals and their liberal compatriots in conservative clothing.”</p>
        <p>“So you think Americans are hungry for a more aggressive form of conservatism?”</p>
        <p>“Absolutely. The common American is starting to wake up from the nightmare woven by the dark satanic embers of a future without the family, the free market, and common sense. Every day, Americans wake up in a nation where the evil fruits of the tree of liberal delusion bloom and rain like bombs above our suburbs, our rural communities, our urban communities. Our homes.”</p>
        <p>“So you think that Americans are becoming very embittered with the status quo?”</p>
        <p>“Not just embittered. Actively angry at the system, which has taken everything from them. They have taken everything from you, the people watching. Your faith, your family, low prices, they want it all. If conservatives do not win an election, and liberals continue to occupy the White House, spreading lies and treachery, selling the American people like Pilate, we could see a real revolt. A very real war for the very soul of our nation could take place across our nation.”</p>
        </p>“Do you mean to say you think we could be on the verge of a civil war?”</p>
        <p>“No comment.”</p>

        <h3 class="endingtitle">Mother, we just can’t get enough</h3>
        <h2 class="endingdate">April 7th 1999</h2>
        <p>They walked and walked for what felt like miles. Newt felt that he was definitely getting older. The younger man that he used to be could have done this with ease. Aging fucking sucks. He reached ever higher on the hill, his sore legs aching with a deep fire from within that could not be cleansed with any external treatment. He rested against a large, dark oak tree, flinching at the feeling of the skin of his legs brushing up against the dark brown bark. He slouches down a little and looks at his map. Just 0.2 miles up ahead.</p>
        <p>Newt panted and heaved as he trodded closer to his destination. He hadn’t walked this far in a long time. The wild forest had been mostly untouched. Occasionally, you could stumble upon some old campground or path, but the forest stretched on and on in perpetuity, miles and miles of undisturbed forestry. Small creatures scurried where man doesn’t tread, living and dying in a cycle much like our own. There was a tranquility in places where man didn’t tread. So far away from the sights and sounds of Washington, Newt could feel and hear his own emotions and thoughts in a way he had forgotten how to. It was refreshing.</p>
        <p>“Is this it?” Marianne said, snapping him out of his dauntless introspection.</p>
        <p>“Just coming up on the ridge here, hun,” Newt replied. They kept going until they saw it. God, is it beautiful. If there had been things designed with the intent purpose of being beautiful by an almighty god, this would be one of them. Streams of water poured down onto the gravel below, and it just kept rushing and pouring like the Ganges River. They couldn’t speak. It would’ve ruined the moment to say anything, so they just said nothing at all. The water itself was breathtaking. The streams melded into a thick cascading sheet of clear glass.</p>
        <p>After 20 seconds, one 3-letter word emerges from Newt’s mouth: “Wow.”</p>
        <p>“Yeah.” They say nothing else. Newt saunters over 10 feet and begins setting up the tent, hammering in every stake til it’s secured. It all goes off without a hitch — until the last stake. He leans in, lines up the strike, and falls flat on his chest, but not without splashing Marianne with a mix of mud and sand. She is immediately taken aback. She says nothing for a second, then just laughs, “Newt! You hit me!” Neither of them could predict what happened next. As Newt began to lift himself off the ground, she picked up some mud and sand and slung it at him, hitting him right in the abdomen.</p>
        <p>“Hey! Thats not fair! I only hit you in the leg!” Newt yells, scooping up a fistful of mud and slinging it back in retaliation. She then returns the favor with another scoop. “Okay, this time it’s war!” he yells, exasperated. He scoops up another fist of mud, but before he can throw it, she sprints towards the trees. Newt follows, mud still in hand, “There’s no getting away from this one!” They’re both giggling like small children at this point. Without thinking it through, Marianne jumps into the lake callously. With no other option, Newt jumps in, too.</p>
        <p>So there they are, in a muddy lake out in North Georgia. “I only hit you twice! 3 is not fair!” Marianne says.</p>
        <p>“Hey, neither is jumping in a lake.”</p>
        <p>“Okay, fine, how about we shake hands and agree that it’s a fair draw.”</p>
        <p>“Alright, alright,” Newt says as they shake hands, like some mock business agreement. They dig themselves out of the small pool of water and trudge back up the hill, feeling the agonizing burn in their legs the whole way there. The familiar sight of their tent with one of its stakes popping out of the ground filled them with relief. They were very excited for the prospect of drying themselves off with their towels, to say the least.</p>
        <p>They panted and heaved as they finally lay their heads down on the tent’s nylon ground, undeniably smelling like sweat and mud, but invigorated. Newt just laughs. Marianne does too. For a whole long 30 seconds, they say absolutely nothing, just get absolutely drunk on that moment. There’s nothing like it. Newt struggles to even open his mouth, but he manages to slip out a few words: “God, I am absolutely fucking drenched.” Marianne laughs at his words. It’s dead silent for a good minute. She scoots closer to Newt before looking down at her lap with a frown. Newt could not have ever predicted what she said next.</p>
        <p>“Who is the other woman?” He’s taken aback at her words. But at this point in his life, he can no longer afford lies.</p>
        <p>“There was a woman named Callista.” He struggles out against his entire might. “She’s young. Pretty. Very enterprising young woman. We just hit it off one day. Things lead to other things. I’m sorry.”</p>
        <p>“So why do you even stay with me if you love her?” Marianne wasn’t even angry, just dejectedly disappointed. What to expect from such a man. The very same man who treated his past wife the way he did. She wasn’t an idiot. She knew what she was getting into. “There’s no political boogeyman to stop you. Gephardt can’t impeach you.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t care about her anymore. I need to live with myself. There’s a world where she and I are kindred lovers, but it’s not this one. I need to stop using people. Stop running from who I am. I don’t know if you and I are in it for the long haul. It’s your decision as much as mine. But for now, I don’t know where else to go.”</p>
        <p>“Okay.” That word hung in the air for minutes.</p>
        <p>Without a word, they went outside and placed a sheet down. Neither of them wanted to say anything else. They just watched as it turned to night and the stars emerged from the sky. God, it was beautiful. Suddenly, streamers of color began to zip across the sky. Dear god. That’s not possible, it’s an aurora borealis. “That is not scientifically possible!” Newt’s brain thought. It’s a warm, April night in North Georgia. That is not when or where the aurora borealis happens. This is absolutely impossible. Nope. No way. The rich, vivid colors made his eyes hurt for a second before they could adjust to the pure majesty.</p>
        <p>One 3-letter word emerges from Newt’s mouth: “How?” </p>
        <p>4 more words from Marianne come between them before they stop speaking completely for the next 20 minutes: “Shh. Don’t say anything.” Then pure silence. Just nothing but stunned awe.</p>
