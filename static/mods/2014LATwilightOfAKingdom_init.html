    text = "It's no small task to describe all the good(and bad) that Edwin Edwards has brought to Louisiana. In a system that prioritized the racially inflammatory rhetoric, Edwards seemed truly concerned with the plight of African-Americans and made the first real Louisiana coalition of Black voters to propel him to victory in the long campaign of 1972 against multiple Long family members and former governor Jimmie Davis, who owns the rights to You Are My Sunshine. Edwards, not wanting to go through that taxing experience again, reworked the Louisiana election to the jungle primary that still exists today, unintentionally giving the nascent Republican Party a massive boost. A rewriting of Louisiana's outdated, racist Constitution of 1921 and restructuring of state government coincided with an oil boom that left Edwards with sky high approval ratings as he departed his post in 1979. However, Edwards would roar back in 1983 to rout Louisiana's first Republican governor since Reconstruction, with Edwards' absurd charisma key to this victory. Edwin's luck would run out in this term, as accusations of corruption boiled over in a well publicized trial that <i>somehow</i> saw him acquitted in 1986. With no robust economy to hold him over, Edwards would suffer his first ever electoral failure in his 30 year career, falling short against reformer Buddy Roemer. Before he actually lost, however, Edwards would drop out and pull the rug out from underneath him before he was even elected, teeing Edwards up for yet another comeback.<br><br><button onclick='back3()'>Back</button></p>"

But those days are long gone now. Conservatism and religious pearl clutching has captured the hearts and minds of Louisiana's faithful, and Edwards’ long rap sheet of dubious legality in the governor's mansion puts him at odds with many that once made up the very same coalition that holed him up for over 4,000 days in the state capital. His political successor <b>Buddy Roemer</b> has proven to be no better in the governor’s chair than Edwards, struggling to maintain a coalition willing to implement his reform oriented policy plans. Still, his personal character is a shining beacon when placed up against that of Edwards, and it will take a village to uproot Roemer from his seat given the quality of his opposition.<br><br><button onclick='next3()'>Next</button></p>"
