The KMT-PFP Alliance Wins the 2004 Election!</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><u><strong>The opposition parties formed a coalition government, ending the short-lived DPP regime</strong></u></p><p><strong>A</strong>s the first light of dawn gently pierces the horizon, a new future for Taiwan slowly emerges on the skyline. It is a subtle and hopeful dawn, as if heralding the coming of an entirely new era. On March 19, when news of A-Bian being shot swept over like a cold wind, a lingering suspense gripped your heart—could this be yet another conspiracy designed to rob you of victory? Tomorrow, as the people’s ballot boxes reveal the truth, all mysteries will finally be laid bare.</p><p>After casting that sacred vote, you stroll to the imposing headquarters of the KMT, joining a grand assembly on the night of the vote count. Down below, thousands of people gather in a surging tide, each person clutching a flag adorned with the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Red Ground. The KMT, the People First Party, the New Party—every pan-blue faction has converged beneath your soaring banner. In the midst of the crowd, the fluttering of countless flags weaves a picture of passionate unity, causing the light in your eyes to shimmer with a hazy mist.</p><p>Barely had the voting ended when the television screens began to flash with a torrent of numbers and announcements. The media launched into a frenzy of inflated figures. Although each station’s numbers were slightly exaggerated, the unanimous message was clear—Lien and Song were leading by a wide margin. At 4:02, one channel proclaimed that Lien and Song’s vote count had exceeded 100,000; shortly after, at 4:18, other channels reported figures over one million; at 4:30, a channel boldly announced three million votes; and even before 5:00, another channel declared the tally had surpassed five million. Frowning, you hurriedly checked the Central Election Commission’s website—only a mere 50,000-plus valid votes had been counted. This numerical game was nothing more than a media stunt designed to capture ratings.</p><p><strong>As night deepens</strong>, the deep blue on the screen transforms into a vast, boundless ocean, gradually swallowing county after county. This beautiful island has chosen to embrace the same hue as the infinite sea; every sparkling pixel embodies the people's unwavering support for you. At this moment, it is no longer empty posturing or mere hype—it is an unassailable victory. From the very start of the count, Lien and Song’s lead was unshakable, and now it stands as firm as a rock. All the polls and predictions had long tilted in your favor; Taiwanese voters had come to expect this outcome. Yet when the final numbers burst forth on the screen, even you found yourself holding your breath, overwhelmed by the weight of victory.</p><p>With a <strong>vote share exceeding 55%</strong>, you have secured the eleventh presidency of the Republic of China—an outcome that had been meticulously planned by you and your campaign team. A-Bian’s cunning tricks never materialized; the scandals involving party assets, domestic violence, and property disputes—as well as the murky gunshot incident—failed to impact the result. Chen Shui-bian’s pitifully assembled campaign team and their populist tactics were utterly crushed by the mighty alliance of the KMT and the People First Party, becoming nothing more than a dismal chapter in history. The past four years seem like a nightmare you whisper to yourself in the twilight.</p><p>At that moment, the telephone rings, carrying a tone of surrender from A-Bian. You respond courteously yet firmly, as that small-town man from Tainan on the other end of the line can only begrudgingly admit that his victory was nothing but a stroke of luck he never deserved. Though a secret thrill of triumph stirs within you, you know you must maintain your dignity and swallow that sneer deep inside.</p><p>After enduring his feeble ramblings, you finally feel a long-awaited sense of release. Just then, the grand doors of the party headquarters suddenly swing open, as if beckoning you to step outside.</p><p><em>“Chairman Lien—no, President! The crowd outside demands that you address them!”</em><br><br>Song Chu-yu rushes in, his face alight with uncontainable excitement and anticipation. Outside, the roar of the assembled masses shakes every stone of the building. </p><p><strong>At that moment, you know—it is time to step forward into your moment of glory.</strong></p></div>`)

Tribe children gather around a great stone, surface etched with a white sun flickering in dim light—watchful, perhaps sighing. Faint campfire flames reveal their tattered clothes, yet eyes burn with curious sparks.</p><p>An elder approaches slowly and sits. His robe, patched with faded cloth, bears a gaze deep as an ancient well. He gently strokes the stone and murmurs, “Children, this white sun marks our bloodline. Do you know its tale?”</p><p>A boy, face smudged with dust, speaks first: “Elder, why is it white? What does it mean?”</p><p>The elder smiles. “Silly child, isn’t the sun white?”</p><p>His gaze lingers on the carving, as if recalling something distant. “White is hope’s color—the brilliance that once lit a land. It belonged to ancestors who dreamed of a united home.”</p><p>The boy fiddles with a broken metal shard, just unearthed while chasing a worm through scorched soil. “That land—where is it?”</p><p>The elder swallows, throat tight. After a pause, he sighs. “Ash now. An island called Taiwan, lost to time’s abyss. Long ago, it thrived, its people shaping destiny through elections.”</p><p>“What’s an election?” asks a small boy, voice clear as a chime.</p><p>“Elections chose leaders with slips of paper,” the elder says. “Each one marked a favored song, and the loudest led the way.”</p><p>A girl, hair tangled with dry grass, tilts her head. “Paper slips? Like this stone, carved with the sun’s mark?”</p><p>The elder shakes his head, lips curved with wistful fondness. “No, child. Thin as leaves, those slips carried convictions—songs of freedom or reunion.”</p><p>The dusty boy pauses, shard still in hand. “Songs? Like wind over these ruins?”</p><p>“Somewhat,” the elder nods. “But these were beliefs. Taiwan knew two songs: one chanting of a lone boat’s far voyage; the other calling for a dance with the distant shore.”</p><p>The small boy frowns. “Which song won?”</p><p>The elder’s eyes drift past firelight, chasing a fading specter. “The green singer, with fiery words, kindled hearts. His song surged like a tsunami, drowning the blue’s soft hum. Crowds cheered.”</p><p>The girl whispers, “The blue ones—weren’t they angry?”</p><p>“Angry?” The elder’s sigh is soft. “Their hearts broke. They raised torches for reunion’s dream, but the green tide doused them. Cracks formed, tearing the land’s soul.”</p><p>The dusty boy’s knuckles whiten around the shard. “What became of the cracks?”</p><p>“They birthed a storm.” The elder’s voice rumbles like a drum. “Across the sea, a dragon’s scales flashed, glaring at the green boat. War drums thundered. Iron birds darkened skies, ships cleaved waves. Though small, that land stood like stone against the tempest.”</p><p>The girl trembles. “Then what? Why is it gone?”</p><p>The elder shuts his eyes, as if listening to whispers of the dead. “A sealed tower, holding sun’s wrath, was torn open by war’s flames. Poison fog rose, veiling both sun and moon, consuming life. The storm raged on, fire leapt across seas, scorching distant shores. Stars fell. The world plunged into endless night.”</p><p>Children hold their breath. Crackling fire echoes ancient cataclysm. The small boy murmurs, “Is this our world?”</p><p>“Yes,” the elder nods. “But we are embers. Blue tribe, bearers of that blue song, guard this white sun—not to stoke old grudges, but to remember: division is poison, harmony the cure.”</p><p>The girl lifts her gaze, eyes aglow. “Can we make the sun shine again?”</p><p>The elder smiles, brushing the stone with a fingertip. “If hearts and hands unite, its light will return. Let it guide you—beyond colors—to rebuild our home.”</p><p>dusty boy hesitates. “But if the green ones remain, will we fight again?”</p><p>The elder meets his eyes, gentle. “Child, green and blue are heart’s songs. War doesn’t come from colors—but from hearts out of tune. Learn to listen. Lean on each other. Then the sun will never fade.”</p><p>The fire dims. One by one, children touch the white sun. Its cool surface whispers history. The girl’s fingers linger, sensing faint warmth. The elder rises, melting into the night. The white sun remains, sentinel of memory, beacon of what was—and what may be.</p><p><br></p></div>`)

The Pan-Blue alliance has been utterly defeated!</u></h2><p style="text-align: center;"><u><strong>The DPP has won with over 57% of the vote, a margin exceeding one million votes!</strong></u></p><p>The past year’s election campaign has been nothing short of <strong>thrilling and perilous</strong>. Since your election as president in 2000, your administration has been viewed as precarious. The Kuomintang and the People First Party have a larger base than the DPP, and if Lien Chan and Song Chu-yu could form a viable winning alliance, all domestic and international media and polls would predict the KMT’s return to power. Yet, this did not come to pass.</p><p>Despite Lien Chan leading in opinion polls for nearly a year, his <strong>lackluster personal charisma</strong>, family wealth controversies, and the KMT’s tarnished image of corruption and baggage clearly dragged him down. Chen Shui-bian skillfully exploited these weaknesses to deliver a severe blow to Lien. Moreover, the internal discord within the Pan-Blue alliance, hastily cobbled together by Lien and Song’s mutual interests, further undermined their campaign. However, no one could have anticipated just how treacherous this election would become—not even you expected that <strong>someone would attempt to take your life</strong>.</p><p>Following the <strong>March 19 shooting incident</strong>, all of Taiwan was engulfed in an atmosphere of terror and panic. Underground radio stations relentlessly fueled conspiracy theories and hateful rhetoric, while Pan-Blue supporters were equally consumed by the belief that "the Pan-Green camp and Chen staged it all." Hundreds of thousands of military and police personnel were mobilized to maintain order and enforce a state of national emergency. Even on election day, many of them were unable to cast their votes. Underground betting odds indicated that by the eve of the election, the polls had reversed, and Chen had clearly gained the upper hand.</p><p>As the vote counting began after <strong>5 p.m. on election day</strong>, major television networks raced to tally the results. You quickly noticed discrepancies between these counts and those officially released by the Central Election Commission—the speed of the count seemed suspiciously fast. Nevertheless, the situation appeared highly favorable: unexpectedly, the KMT underperformed in the central and northern regions, and even their traditional strongholds in the Hakka areas of Taoyuan, Hsinchu, and Miaoli, as well as the eastern coast, showed significant signs of wavering. A triumphant smile spread across your face. Lien Chan and Song had been gloating for a year, but now they were being overwhelmingly surpassed by you. On the television screen, a <strong>green tide</strong> relentlessly battered the KMT’s coastal strongholds, eventually flooding your view. The green glow flickered in your eyes—a symbol of victory.</p><p>With over 57% of the vote, you <strong>decisively defeated Lien Chan and Song</strong>, winning by a margin of more than a million votes. Did they really think they could win? Did they believe their base was unshakable? The landscape has changed since 2000; this result signifies the Taiwanese people’s complete trust in you, ensuring your administration can sail smoothly through its second term with strong support for re-election. The DPP’s future in 2008 looks boundless! But first, you must face the <strong>December legislative elections</strong>. If you can reclaim the Legislative Yuan, your government’s path forward will be unimpeded.</p><p>At that moment, Lien Chan called to concede:<br><strong>“President Chen, congratulations on your victory. The Taiwanese people have made their choice, and I respect this outcome.”</strong><br><br>His voice was subdued, tinged with resignation and a hint of relief.<br><br>You responded with a smile:<br><strong>“Thank you, Chairman Lien, for your congratulations. This election was a fair contest, and the Taiwanese people have expressed their will through their votes. I look forward to us working together for Taiwan’s prosperity and stability in the future.”</strong><br><br>After the formalities, he faded from your thoughts. In his lifetime, he would only ever be a vice president.</p><p>Hanging up the phone, you turned to gaze out the window. Taipei’s night sky twinkled with stars, as if celebrating this hard-won victory alongside you. This <strong>landslide win</strong>, with over 57% of the vote, is not just a personal triumph but a historic breakthrough for the DPP under your leadership. Since first coming to power in 2000, the DPP has been striving to solidify its hold on governance, and this million-vote margin undoubtedly lays a solid foundation for future development.</p><p><br></p></div>`)

Yesterday, you were shot by a mysterious gunman, but today, you appear before your supporters, looking healthy and flushed with energy. The crowd below is ecstatic, their faces painted in green and white camouflage. Seeing this scene, a surge of positive emotion wells up within you. With such supporters, you are certain of your victory.</p><p>The numbers on the big screen begin to dance. It’s just past 5 p.m., and the vote counts on TV are already pouring in. At first, you worried whether Lien Chan might defeat you by a few percentage points, as the exit polls suggested. But now, it’s clear that was an overconcern. The media are racing to report the votes, far outpacing the Central Election Commission’s official tally.</p><p>The DPP supporters are fervent and indignant. The truth behind yesterday’s shooting remains unclear, and they are still caught up in conspiracy theories about the KMT or even the Communist Party colluding to assassinate you. Regardless of how it ends, you know you’ll face no real trouble. As long as you win the presidency, who cares about the details of the shooting? No one will judge it like a god. As more votes are counted, the situation becomes increasingly favorable. The south is performing better than expected, and you’re clearly ahead in the central region. Even in the north, the KMT’s stronghold, there’s a significant surge in pan-green votes. The situation is different from four years ago. Lien Chan and Song Chu-yu thought that 23.1% + 36.9% equals 60%? Laughable. Now, it’s you who <strong>holds over 55% of the votes.</strong></p><p>After your victory speech, Lien Chan has nothing left to say, but you’re still waiting for him to make that concession call. Ding-dong, ding-dong, it finally rings.</p><p><strong>The phone rings in the quiet room. </strong>You take a deep breath and answer. Lien Chan’s voice comes through, low and slightly weary: “President Chen, congratulations on your victory. The Taiwanese people have made their choice, and I respect that.”</p><p>You reply with a smile: “Thank you, Chairman Lien, for your congratulations. This election was a fair contest, and the Taiwanese people have expressed their will through their votes. I look forward to us working together for Taiwan’s prosperity and stability.”</p><p>The conversation is brief, and the line goes dead. The formalities are over, and it seems he has nothing more to say. In any case, his highest position in life was just four years as vice president. It looks like Ma Ying-jeou will soon oust him from the chairmanship, and he can leave your life. Since first coming to power in 2000, the DPP has been striving to consolidate its rule, and this victory, with a margin of over a million votes, undoubtedly lays a solid foundation for the future. You know this is just a new beginning; December’s legislative elections will determine whether you remain a lame duck in your second term. <strong>Don’t celebrate too early.</strong></p><p><br></p></div>`)

A shift of just one or two percentage points could alter everything. Nevertheless, the DPP’s governance has been affirmed by the people: you’ve defeated Lien Chan with over 52% of the vote. Though the margin is only a few hundred thousand votes, it’s still a commendable achievement. Lien and Song thought they could coast to victory with the seven million votes from 2000?

For a whole year, the KMT’s alliance with Song Chu-yu held a commanding lead in the polls. Thankfully, over the past few months, your team finally closed the gap.</p><p>Yesterday’s gunshot nearly cost you your life—and quite possibly your presidency. According to the latest TVBS exit polls, you trailed with 47% against the KMT’s 53%. You feared Lien Chan would ride that momentum to crush you, dragging the DPP back into the wilderness of pre-2000 rule—and that you’d become a<strong> laughingstock, a pitiful footnote in history.</strong></p><p>But none of that came to pass. As counting began, ballots from the north poured in for the KMT like a tidal wave. Every major TV program—especially the pro-blue channels—broadcast their lead, and worst of all, the Central Election Commission’s own vote-count tracker showed the KMT surging ahead. It was infuriating—you even broke out in a cold sweat. The only comfort came from knowing that precinct reports were still scarce, and many central and southern regions were just getting started with their counts.</p><p>This race was agonizingly close. Painfully, almost unbearably so. Then, after six o’clock, votes from central and southern Taiwan began to swing your way. Deficits of hundreds of thousands shrank to tens of thousands, then to mere thousands—until you overtook the combined total of Lien Chan and Song Chu-yu. Haha, Lien must have been grinding his teeth—just a one- or two-point margin, yet decisive. You silently thanked voters in central and southern Taiwan; their support more than made up for your losses in Hakka areas and the north. Otherwise, you’d never have slept tonight. Luckily, insomnia wasn’t your fate.</p><p><br></p><p>When you delivered your victory speech, the crowd was still roaring. The screen showed only a razor-thin lead—one or two percentage points—but it was enough: you had secured a second term by the will of all Taiwan. Now you waited for one very important call—well, maybe not so important. The phone rang, and you could hear distant horns blaring in the background.</p><p>“President Chen, congratulations on your re-election.” Lien Chan’s voice was low and restrained. Though you caught murmurs of <strong>“unfair election” and “assassination attempt”</strong> behind him, his headquarters remained silent on those issues.</p><p>You took a deep breath and replied calmly, “Thank you, Chairman Lien, for your congratulations. This election was a fair contest, and the people of Taiwan have spoken with their ballots. I look forward to working together for Taiwan’s prosperity and stability.”</p><p>These polite pleasantries were tiresome, but you only had to endure them briefly—after which Lien would fade from your daily worries. At least until December’s legislative elections heated up, you wouldn’t have to think about him again. The line went dead; you could sense his lingering frustration. But what could he do against hundreds of thousands of votes? He could go home and cry to his dear one. <strong>At least tonight, those tears would not be yours.</strong></p></div>`)

Real A-Bian is already a grandfather, said to have a tuna-belly; Doll A-Bian, by contrast, looks “cute and pudgy,” like a healthy, energetic third grader. Real A-Bian’s body proportions are normal—but Doll A-Bian’s head is so huge and heavy it’s almost half his height. In public, real A-Bian always wears a suit (at most, when jogging, a pair of black sneakers that reporters “maliciously misidentify”); I’ve never seen him in full sportswear as Doll A-Bian is.</p><p>Everything about him is so different that you’d never associate this toy with the word “president.”</p><p><br></p><p>Most of the time, you’d simply call him “A-Bian,” because the president in your memory looks nothing like this.</p><p>When I was young, the president was printed on a piece of paper—bald, with a short beard, a kindly old man. In color, he was framed and hung high on the back wall of the classroom; at assemblies, we’d all turn and bow three times to face him. Sometimes he stood in a cement or marble pedestal labeled “Everlasting Leader,” only his chest up visible, silently watching us raise the flag at the school gate. Other times he stood alone on a fountain pedestal in the city center or park; passersby and cars had to cautiously steer around him, and anyone approaching had to be hushed, slow, solemn, and reverent—like seeing a sorrowful but holy Christ on a cross in a church. If that basin-shaped “capital” in the north were a temple thriving with incense, he’d be the deity cloaked in swirling smoke, said to bless the people. Even after I entered university, I found him in military uniform atop a legendary horse that at midnight would supposedly swap legs—upright and spirited, guarding the back gate, yet his eyes were filled with the melancholy of exile, gazing at a homeland he could never return to, just as he once did on those frontline islands.</p><p>His name is carved on the nation’s grand gates, and on the busiest streets of every city. His words are printed on the back of every elementary school workbook, or made into the very first lesson of every junior-high Chinese textbook. I was happy to remember his birth and death dates—those red-letter days on the calendar when we got to rest and play.</p><p><br></p><p>Back then I saw him everywhere: on the reverse of coins, the face of bills, the back of my classroom, in roundabouts—in every horseback pose, every cane-supported stance, every rigid seat in the cold, blue-roofted palace—each determined but lonely gaze, each face straining to suppress a sigh, so much like the real man.</p><p>So like him—and yet so distant. Even though he was ever-present, he felt farther from me than a god I’d never seen: that deity hidden deep in my heart, always listening to my prayers, while the president merely sat in a well-ventilated but dim memorial hall, waiting for me to line up, bow, and lay flowers. Back then, he was the island’s greatest superstar; we all cheered for him from a safe distance and truly hoped he’d live forever. When he was blurry in our sight, we were ecstatic to grasp the “great man’s” radiance; as we drew closer, though, we grew a little afraid.</p><p>Later, we had other presidents—more color photographs to hang on the wall. Of course, they resembled the real person and always smiled kindly, though Zhongshan suits gave way to Western-style suits or jackets, and they began wearing glasses—but I still could only look up to them.</p><p><br></p><p>The third president was as friendly as the uncle selling scallion pancakes on the neighborhood corner.</p><p>The fourth president—rumor has it someone once wanted to execute him.</p><p>Oh, I forgot the second president. Does anyone remember his name or what he looked like?</p><p><br></p><p>Then one day a few years ago, the president’s image stopped being solemn and stiff, the verdigris vanished—he became soft, relaxed, laugh-loving, wore bright clothes, and ran barefoot through fields like so many of us did in childhood. He didn’t resemble any predecessor; the only shared trait was that his Mandarin was never perfect. Like all the big figures before him, he entered your life—but in a new way: you could cuddle him like a kitten or puppy, call him “cute” without disrespect. He came in many sizes—you could spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars to bring one home, place him by your bedside like a Teddy bear, Doraemon, or Hello Kitty. You could take him to a baseball game to curse your hated home team’s collapse; prop him against your windshield in traffic jams so he could commiserate with fellow stuck drivers; on a whim, you could draw a mustache on him, dot a mole, apply blush or eyeshadow—or when irritated, hang him upside-down on the balcony or dunk him in murky bathwater, punch him, stomp him, squeeze him, hurl him into a corner, or pin him to the wall for darts.</p><p>He’s your president—basically, you can do whatever you want with him. But rest assured, no matter how you treat him, he won’t cry or complain; he’ll just keep smiling blankly at you.</p><p>A college friend recently went on a business trip to Germany and brought me the latest, tiniest “A-Bian.” Normally I don’t hang charms on my bag, but this time I’ll fix him to my backpack so he’s with me every day at school, at the market, on the street. If anyone asks who this big-headed little guy is, I’ll proudly say: he’s our president.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Fifty years gone by.

Just yesterday, Chiou I-jen was all smiles, insisting this cut-throat battle was a guaranteed win. He’d already made all the arrangements—damn it, that sly grin of his must have jinxed you. Why would he wear such a crafty smile when the president had just been shot? There’s got to be something off here, but you can’t pinpoint the mistake.</p><p>After voting, you returned to the rally where DPP supporters had gathered. You knew it would be, as Chiou predicted, unbelievably close. All you dared hope for was victory—defeating the dream team of Lien Chan and Song Chu-yu. You almost couldn’t bear to imagine what Taiwan’s future would look like if the DPP lost. If the KMT and PFP returned… your four-year term would become a joke, proving that your 2000 win was mere luck.</p><p>As night fell, that possibility loomed larger than ever. Even setting aside the pro-KMT chatter on CTi News and TVBS, the Central Election Commission’s updates showed the KMT holding a fragile but steady lead. Clearly, KMT supporters in Taoyuan and the north had turned out in force—a chill ran down your spine. If DPP voters in the south didn’t come out strong, it would be a complete embarrassment.</p><p>They didn’t. Or even if they did, it wasn’t enough. That was even more despairing. Turnout in central and southern regions was lackluster, and in Taoyuan-Hsinchu-Miaoli and Taipei you were clearly trailing Lien. Worse still, the DPP’s performance in the south fell short. As Lien’s lead held—just tens of thousands, then thousands—the returns from each new precinct refused to let you close the gap. You knew that with every precinct unreported, you edged one step closer to defeat.</p><p>Night was deep. It was over. Lien Chan beat you by less than 0.22%—a matter of just a few votes. You tried to figure out what went wrong: Chiou I-jen’s mysterious smile? Neglecting certain districts? A debate gaffe? Or a faltering economy? None of it mattered now. The crowd at the rally fell silent; tears welled in their eyes and dampened their clothes as you forced yourself to concede. Though you’d imagined this scene countless times over the past year, you still couldn’t accept it. It was time to make that call. This was what the people of Taiwan deserved… If they wanted the KMT’s black-money tactics, dictatorship, authoritarianism, and corruption back, then so be it. Goddamn them.</p><p><strong>“Chairman Lien, this is A-Bian… congratulations—”</strong></p><p>Your voice trembled.

Just four years after the 1996 direct presidential election, the Taiwanese people chose to vote the KMT out of the Presidential Office, relegating them to the role of an opposition party to oversee the DPP. However, the past four years in office have made it hard for the people to believe in the DPP's future governance. This is evident from numerous pre-election polls, and even though the gap between the two sides has narrowed in recent months, it has not altered the deep-rooted convictions of the Blue Camp's base or the disdain of swing voters for the current administration.</p><p>Reflecting repeatedly on the campaign journey of the past few months—those speeches rushed across various places, the handshakes with voters, the verbal battles on the debate stage—everything converges to this moment.

As night falls, reports from numerous polling stations indicate that you are trailing in the election, just as the polls over the past year have predicted; indeed, you are on the verge of defeat.</p><p>Vice President Lu Hsiu-lien stands aside, her brows furrowed, her gaze occasionally sweeping over the TV screen. "The data from the south isn’t fully out yet," she suddenly says, "we still have a chance." Her voice carries a hint of hope, but Chen Shui-bian knows that the south is the DPP’s traditional stronghold. If they cannot secure a substantial lead even there, the chances of victory grow ever slimmer.</p><p>As time passes, the election results become increasingly clear. A few percentage points determine life and death, but this time, Lady Luck no longer favors you. Or perhaps the effort was insufficient—you seem to understand how Song felt in 2000, though this time, he emerges as the victor. A-Zhen gently holds your hand; seated in her wheelchair, she whispers, "No matter the outcome, you are the hero in my heart." Only she would say that. Her legs were permanently disabled because of your county magistrate election; now, she has witnessed both your rise to the top and your precipitous fall.</p><p>Lien Chan has won more votes than you imagined, breaching your psychological defenses entirely. Sparse applause rises from below, mingled with soft sobs. You must deliver your concession speech now. After uttering these hollow words, you can finally be free. Four years ago, Lien Chan didn’t even attend your inauguration; this time, you resolve not to attend his. You’re even.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>"Chairman Lien, this is A-Bian. Congratulations to you…"</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Taiwan’s democratic journey has only just begun.</p></div>`)

DPP Returns to the Opposition!</u></h3><p><strong>Outside, the crowds are nowhere</strong> near as large as four years ago—you can feel it clearly. The year-long campaign has drained you, and stagnant polls have left you desperate and helpless. Though your numbers crept up slightly in the final month or two, they never shook the Taiwanese electorate’s core support for the KMT. Perhaps it was decided long ago—during your past years in office you sensed this outcome—but you never imagined defeat would come so swiftly, so suddenly.</p><p>After five o’clock, the race lost all suspense. Unquestionably, Lien Chan built a commanding lead in the north and central regions. Even in the DPP’s traditional strongholds of the south, turnout plunged, and Lien likely exceeded the KMT’s base there too. You never expected even southern voters to turn against you. Yet strangely, you feel calm—this result was widely predicted: everyone knew Lien Chan would beat you in 2004, so when it actually happened, no one was surprised. You yourself had long prepared mentally for defeat.</p><p>The DPP fell to the KMT by over a million votes. Campaign headquarters fell silent. Supporters wore solemn faces and exchanged wordless glances; even their usual words of comfort became stifled sighs. Because this outcome had been foreseen, it stirred no uproar—only regret and reminiscence. Why did the people’s great hopes for the DPP—the pioneers of Taiwan’s democracy and reform—yield to such a crushing defeat just four years after their first takeover? Disappointment permeates your camp, and you will never be president again. The DPP’s political strength has been severely weakened… Some say the DPP won’t govern again for the next twenty years. Let’s hope the future isn’t so bleak.</p><p>Hardly anyone even notices your concession speech. Now you have only one task left—and once it’s done, you can go home.</p><p><strong>“Chairman Lien, this is A-Bian… congratulations—”</strong></p><p>Few ears remain to hear you. Your four-year term may well become a cautionary tale for all future presidents.</p><p><br></p></div>`)

Since the Taiwan Independence Association (TIA) knew that Chiang was returning to Taiwan from Beijing on April 2nd, the Taiwan Independence Action motorcade went to the airport to “greet” Chiang with protests of his visits to Beijing, which they deemed were a betrayal of Taiwan.</p><p>Soon after Chiang’s return to Taiwan, there were rumors that Lien Chan would be going to Beijing on April 26. Su Beng’s assessment of this situation was that the Kuomintang (KMT) was about to sellout Taiwan to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).</p><p>So the Taiwan Independence Association’s underground network began surveilling Lien Chan’s every move. On April 26, from the moment that Lien stepped out of his house, members of the Taiwan Independence Association began following him to the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport. Lien was followed on the highway by about 100 people in 70 Taiwan Independence Association vehicles. After following him for 49.5 km on the highway, the Taiwan Independence Association was able to stop Lien’s vehicle for about 5 minutes. But because Lien had some police escorts with him, the police stopped the Taiwan Independence Association from blockading Lien’s vehicle. Even after the Taiwan Independence Association was not able to blockade Lien, they followed Lien to the airport. No newspapers in Taiwan reported this incident.</p><p>Once people from the TIA and Su Beng arrived at the airport and were on the third floor of the airport, they saw some people dressed in black using bats to beat up some old Taiwanese men who were at the airport protesting Lien’s visit to China. The people from the Taiwan Independence Association who were with Su Beng were not carrying any weapons with them, but they had some fireworks on them, so they set off the fireworks to scare away the men dressed in black. The police stopped the Taiwan Independence Association people, so then Su Beng and people from the TIA left through a side door.</p><p>The Taiwan Independence Association had tried to blockade Lien Chan on the highway en route to the airport, in hopes that if they could delay Lien by half an hour, it would make international news. In doing so, this would send an international message that Taiwan is not a part of China. Not only did the Taiwan Independence Association want to stop Lien Chan’s visit, but more importantly, they wanted to warn the Taiwanese people that Lien Chan, the KMT and CCP were all going to betray Taiwan.</p><p>Since the 4-26 incident, the Taiwan Independence Association has used every opportunity possible to warn the Taiwanese that the KMT would betray Taiwan. Though, some Taiwanese might be aware of this, most are not aware of the seriousness of this.<br><br>On October 1, 2009, the Republic of China’s supreme court made a judgment regarding the 4-26 incident. They ordered 92-year-old Su Beng to serve 6 months and 50 days of detention for violations related to the incidents on April 2 and April 26, 2005. Su Beng’s assistant, Bin Hong has been ordered to serve 6 months, plus 3 months of detention for violations related to the incidents on April 2 and April 26, 2005. Su Beng and Bin Hong seriously object to this sentence. The ROC law is not the law of Taiwan. How can one be charged as guilty for loving Taiwan?<br><br>The judgment was announced on October 1, 2009, which is the 60th anniversary of the Peoples’ Republic of China. In doing so, the KMT is using this judgment as a tool to appease the Chinese Communist Party. The Taiwanese people should know that the ROC does not represent the country of Taiwan. Taiwan will survive only if Taiwan becomes independent.<br></p></div>`)

    e.pages.push(`<div class="tv-fade css-id" style='overflow-y:auto;'><h2 style="text-align: center;"><u>The Green Sweet Potato</u></h2><p>A-ming adjusted the straps of his backpack, feeling the weight of his hunting gear and the empty seed pouch. The tribe’s crops had recently fallen ill—leaves yellowed, yields plummeted—and the elders pinned their hopes on him, sending him into the wasteland to find a new plant resistant to disease. He glanced back at the settlement—a cluster of crude huts built from scrap metal and wood, nestled in what was once the Taichung basin. At night, the people lit green torches and gathered around a tattered green flag to pray, saying it was their ancestors’ symbol of unity. Now, it was simply “home”—the only safe haven in the wasteland.</p><p>He drew a deep breath and checked the “Sentinel” at his waist—a square metal box the elders called a gift from the old world that could sense the “blight.” Its scratched surface bore faded markings; on top sat a round dial with a trembling needle and strange symbols beside it. He flipped the switch, and the box emitted a low hum followed by intermittent clicks like distant insects. The elders taught him that slow clicks meant the area was relatively safe, but once they quickened into a frantic staccato, he had to flee at once. Clutching his makeshift spear—its hefty weight lending him confidence—he set off toward the Old City.</p><p>A-ming learned to heed those clicks: slow and sporadic was safe; rapid and continuous meant immediate retreat. He didn’t know how the device sensed the invisible poison—the elders called it “blight,” left over from the Great Fire—but he trusted its guidance. In this twisted wasteland, the Sentinel was his sole barrier against death. As long as it stayed quiet, he knew he was still alive. Gripping his cobbled-together spear of scrap iron and wood, he embarked on the trek to the ruins.</p><p>He followed the familiar trail, bracketing him with twisted trees whose leaves glowed faint green like radiation-soaked ghosts. He carefully avoided their branches—the elders warned that their sap could eat flesh. On the horizon, shattered towers and collapsed buildings loomed: the Old City’s skeleton, once home to millions.</p><p>The sky was gray and murky. Acidic breezes drifted by, reminding him of the radiated zones. The Sentinel hummed and clicked occasionally but gave no danger warning. A-ming quickened his pace, recalling the elders’ legend: deep within the ruins lay an “Eden” whose plants could save the tribe from starvation. He had no proof the legend was true, but it was his only hope.</p><p>After hours of trudging, he reached the Old City’s edge. Once-soaring towers now stood as steel skeletons; shards of glass glittered like broken stars on the ground. He gingerly picked his way through the rubble-strewn streets, ears straining for any disturbance. Then a low growl echoed from an alley. He froze, spear raised, breath caught in his throat.</p><p>A pack of feral dogs burst from shadow—mottled fur, eyes glowing an eerie blue. Radiation had mutated them into hulking brutes, their claws razor-sharp, slobber dripping from their teeth. The lead dog snarled and lunged. A-ming knew he couldn’t face a pack head-on. He swept his gaze around and spotted a heap of collapsed concrete.</p><p>He sprinted for the rubble, scrambling up its jagged slopes as the dogs gave chase. Spearing one that tried to follow, he heard it yelp and tumble down, buying him a moment’s respite. Seizing the chance, he leaped off the other side into a narrow alley. The dogs’ barks faded behind him. Leaning against a wall, he panted, heart pounding, thankful to have escaped.</p><p>Pressing on, A-ming entered an area draped in vines. Amid the tangle stood a massive glass structure, shattered yet still recognizable. He pushed open a rusted iron door and stepped into a greenhouse. The air was humid and warm, thick with the scent of foliage. To his astonishment, the plants not only survived here—they thrived. Some fruits glimmered, others bore serrated leaves.</p><p>In one corner, he discovered a small office littered with decayed papers and broken equipment. A yellowed notebook lay among them, its pages smudged but adorned with botanical diagrams and maps. He couldn’t decipher the text but guessed this had been a research station. He also found a photograph of robed figures standing before the greenhouse beneath a banner reading “National Botanical Garden.”</p><p>Most striking of all was a mural on the wall. It depicted a suited man hoisting a green flag, leading a crowd against a fire-breathing red dragon. Next came scenes of explosions, the sky engulfed in flames. A-ming stared at the mural, a strange awe stirring in his chest. He saw the figure with the green banner amid ruin and inferno as a prophecy of rebirth.</p><p>Panting, he shifted his gaze to the greenhouse floor. Beneath a cloak of vines lay a large sweet potato, its skin smooth as jade and faintly glowing green. Its shape mirrored the tribal totem’s design uncannily. A-ming knelt and gently brushed aside the soil, revealing thick roots as though the spud had never known blight.</p><p>A-ming stood in stunned silence. Why did this sweet potato’s form match the tribe’s sacred symbol so perfectly? Its veins were robust, its vines untainted—could the elders’ fabled “Eden sweet potato” really exist? History may have forgotten its name, but here it lay before him.</p><p><br></p><p>A-ming’s heart pounded. </p><p>If he could bring this back, perhaps he could renew their home. </p></div>`)

Although the assassination attempt on March 19 plunged the nation and the DPP into chaos, Acting President You Si-kun quickly managed to set things back on track: the DPP Central Committee immediately tapped Taipei County Magistrate Su Tseng-chang—arguably the most influential and capable sitting local leader in the party—to take on the Lien Chan–Song Chu-yu ticket. It proved an astute choice.</p><p>Nicknamed “The Electric Ball,” Magistrate Su Tseng-chang was widely regarded as one of the DPP’s strongest and most approachable figures at the grassroots level. Governing a county of millions—especially one wrapping around the capital, whose image shapes Taiwan’s international reputation—is no easy feat. So when President Chen Shui-bian fell, it was only natural that DPP members rallied around Magistrate Su. With You Si-kun opting not to run, Green supporters coalesced behind Su as the best inheritor of Chen’s political legacy—and he did not disappoint.</p><p>Though the month-long campaign left everyone exhausted, and political violence and fervor showed no signs of abating, Su’s vigorous campaigning and proven competence gave the DPP the upper hand. His strong influence in the north neutralized KMT advantages there, and his clear articulation of cross-Strait policy and preservation of Chen’s legacy kept him in a fragile but steady lead right up to Election Day. When the votes were counted, Su Tseng-chang won with just over 50%—an astonishing defeat of the “dream team” of Lien Chan and Song Chu-yu. Who could have predicted such a turnaround a month earlier? The Taipei County Magistrate was soon to assume the highest office in the land and declare to the world that the people of Taiwan would keep open the doors of democracy and freedom that President Chen had thrown wide—<strong>and that Chen’s legacy would finally be properly safeguarded.</strong></p></div>`)

But this time, the compass seemed to slip off true north. Although the March 19 assassination attempt plunged the entire nation—and the DPP—into chaos, Acting President You Si-kun’s first move was to turn to Taipei County Magistrate Su Tseng-chang, the “Electric Ball” bald strongman. Yet reality proved that this choice did not deliver the rescue they had hoped for.</p><p>Magistrate Su indeed had the experience and charisma to govern millions and guard the capital’s doorstep. In the early days of the crisis, he won widespread goodwill; Green-camp supporters flocked to his banner, viewing him as the ideal heir to President Chen Shui-bian’s legacy. During the intense, month-long campaign, his rousing speeches and precise cross-Strait policy stance briefly lifted the polls—and everything seemed under control. Unfortunately, that high tide did not last. As the vote approached its close, several factors began to eclipse Su’s strengths:</p><p>Many moderates feared his independence stance was little different from You Si-kun’s—or doubted his experience governing at the national level. Ongoing political violence and social unrest shook confidence among business leaders and ordinary citizens, driving many to cast ballots for opponents promising to “restore stability.” Even Taipei County’s own voters grumbled about Su’s failure to complete his term. All of this came to light on Election Day: the northern and central strongholds flipped—once-reliable Taipei County was steadily eaten away by wave after wave of Blue-camp advances; the south, though still turning out in force, failed to form the expected “Green firewall.” With each round of counting, it became clear: Magistrate Su would lose to the Lien Chan–Song Chu-yu ticket—hardly a surprise given the polls’ trajectory over the past year.</p><p>It is over. President Chen’s legacy will be swept away by the KMT, tossed into the gutter like refuse. You failed to safeguard his inheritance. If you can still fight on, perhaps you’ll find a place in 2008…</p></div>`)

Moreover, the prospect of a female president electrified the electorate, boosting turnout among the often-overlooked half of the population. A-Bian’s rightful heir had been found: she made history.

Certain specific actions have also broken established “taboos,” and President Bush’s disapproval of Chen has become unmistakable.</p><p>The article recalls that Bush was once hailed as “the most Taiwan-friendly U.S. president ever,” even described as being “incredibly good.” Yet before Bush’s first term had ended, Washington was awash with talk of “Bush’s dissatisfaction with Chen Shui-bian” and “concerns about the DPP.”</p><p>The commentary traces the souring of U.S.–Taiwan relations back to August 2002, when Chen unexpectedly floated the “one country on each side” doctrine. This sudden declaration astonished Washington and was said to have been characterized by Bush as “stirring up the waters of the Taiwan Strait.” Throughout 2003 and into spring, incidents such as the push for referendums struck at both cross-Strait relations and ties with the United States.</p><p>The article notes that Chen’s “520 Address” earlier this year was vetted by U.S. officials in advance and was broadly reassuring. Unfortunately, just months later Taiwan witnessed a series of moves that greatly unsettled Washington—textbook revisions, calls for a “new constitution,” and more.

He is slated to announce in the morning in Taipei County, then return to his native Pingtung in the afternoon to outline his campaign platform. When asked by reporters on the 24th, Su only replied that he will make the announcement once he has made his decision.</p><p>According to reports, among the DPP’s “Four Heavenly Kings” contending for the 2008 election, former Premier Frank Hsieh was first to declare—making his announcement in Kaohsiung before Lunar New Year. DPP Chairperson Yu Shyi-kun announced his own bid at a Mazu temple near his Yilan County hometown on February 22. Su Tseng-chang, the incumbent Regional Leader, plans to race through both Taipei County and Pingtung County on the 25th for his declaration.</p><p>Insiders close to Su say that to avoid accusations of misusing official resources, he chose not to announce during an official engagement but instead reserved the final day of the Lunar New Year holiday for a standalone press conference, carefully and fully explaining his reasons for running.</p><p>Media sources indicate that on the 25th Su will hold a press conference at Fort San Domingo in Tamsui, with his mother in attendance. He will then embark on Lunar New Year visits with members of his “cabinet” and loyal DPP legislators, and afterward return to Pingtung to brief fellow townspeople.</p><p>Supporters note that Su has served as magistrate in both Taipei and Pingtung, and although born in Pingtung, regards Taipei County as a second home. By racing through both locales in one day—from the north “head” of Taiwan to the southern “tail”—he aims to showcase his trademark “go-go-go” spirit once again.</p><p>Those close to Su say that while he was initially anxious after Frank Hsieh and Yu Shyi-kun entered the DPP primary, he has now finalized his announcement plan, regained his energy, and is ready to demonstrate that same “relentless” vitality.</p><p>When asked about the media’s report that he will declare on the 25th, Su Tseng-chang on the 24th merely said that as soon as the decision is made and the timing is right, he will make it public.</p><p>With the DPP’s “Four Heavenly Kings” now reducing to a three-way contest for the 2008 election, only Former Vice President Annette Lu has yet to confirm her intentions.</p></div>`)

When questioned afterward, Hsieh insisted he was not formally under indictment—but Special Investigation Division chief Chen Yun-nan revealed that Hsieh is considered a suspect in the favor-for-profit case, effectively making him a defendant.</p><p>Hsieh is currently implicated in eleven cases, including the “special allowance,” the MRT scandal, and the political-donation case. During the party primary, he vowed that if indicted over the “special allowance” he would withdraw. Yet on the 10th, while meeting indigenous constituents in Taitung, he reversed course: noting leaks in the political-donation probe, he questioned the prosecutors’ fairness and said he would not bet his future on the judiciary’s integrity—he would only step aside if actually convicted.</p><p>Insiders suggest his reversal stems from lack of confidence in the political-donation outcome. Prosecutor Lo Chien-hsun reportedly told the Investigation Bureau in early April that Hsieh’s alleged embezzlement was “clear,” making prosecution a real possibility.</p><p><strong>Indictment Means Withdrawal</strong></p><p>Despite his tough rhetoric, analysts note that per DPP rules, indictment would strip Hsieh of his party endorsement for the 2008 presidential bid. Party regulations state any member indicted for illicit gain or abuse of power triggers a recommendation for suspension from the party; suspension severs party membership and thus candidate status.</p><p>Within the DPP, there is little optimism. One DPP legislator bluntly remarked that whether Hsieh stays in the race “is not for him to decide!” Amending internal rules to accommodate Hsieh would be difficult—he alienated many factions in the primary, making any special dispensation untenable. Another legislator noted that to date, the suspension-upon-indictment rule has no exceptions: even former deputy secretary Ma Yong-cheng and Chen Shui-bian’s wife Wu Shu-chen were suspended for eighteen months after their “official expenses” indictments.</p><p><strong>Su Tseng-chang Watches Closely</strong></p><p>With all but zero chance of a Hsieh–Su Tseng-chang ticket, should Hsieh withdraw over the “special allowance” indictment, Su would be the de facto nominee. Hsieh’s multiple pending prosecutions weigh heavily—he is seen racing with large burdens that diminish his prospects. Factions within the DPP may eventually rally around Su as their new standard-bearer, and Su Tseng-chang appears content to observe developments from the sidelines.</p></div>`)

He thanks everyone for their concern and expects to be discharged after another two weeks of observation.</p><p>The National Taiwan University Hospital declined to confirm whether his pleural effusion was indeed caused by lung cancer, citing patient and family privacy. NTUH spokesperson Lin He-xiong stated that without the consent of the patient and his relatives, they will not comment on any outside rumors.</p><p>Hospital staff revealed that Chen’s medical records have been locked, accessible only to his attending physician and senior hospital administrators, to prevent any leaks about his condition.</p><p>President and DPP Chairman You Si-kun said yesterday that he visited Chen a month ago; at that time, Chen and his wife were calm, chatting and smiling.

Doctors advised hospitalization, and Chen was admitted on March 21. In addition to pleural effusion, he was diagnosed with hepatitis C, which doctors attributed to chronic fatigue and overwork.</p><p>Throughout his hospitalization, Chen has remained low-profile, refusing to alarm the public. According to Lin Guang-yi, aside from a few former colleagues from the Ministry of Justice and his closest family and friends, Chen has seen no visitors; even Presidential Office Secretary-General Chen Tang-shan was politely turned away.</p><p>Despite choosing discretion, the lung cancer rumors persisted. Lin Guang-yi strongly refuted them, urging the media to refrain from unfounded speculation. He emphasized that Chen’s condition is due solely to long-term fatigue and weakened health, requiring an extended recovery period.</p><p>According to close friends, Chen received his most recent visit this Monday. Reports indicate that he has undergone three thoracenteses to drain the pleural fluid, his hepatitis C is under treatment, and his spirits remain good—he has even inquired about developments at the Ministry of Justice while bedridden.</p></div>`)

In Taiwan, few would not know the answer: she was the first female Vice President in our nation’s history. As Taiwan struggled to transition from authoritarian rule to democracy, she, as a woman, actively participated and thus wrote an irreplaceable chapter in Taiwanese political history.</p><p><strong>Beyond Politics: Champion of Women’s Rights</strong></p><p>Annette Lu’s achievements extended far beyond the political arena—her record in Taiwan’s women’s movement is truly remarkable. From 1971 onward, she advocated for New Feminism, the abolition of child prostitution, reproductive choice, bodily autonomy, and more, gradually building the scaffolding of Taiwan’s modern women’s movement.</p><p><strong>The Precursor Organizations</strong></p><p>Before Lu’s activism, two major women’s groups existed under Kuomintang rule after the government’s relocation to Taiwan:</p><ul><li>The Republic of China Women’s Federation (Fuyuanhui), founded in 1950 by First Lady Chiang Mei-ling as the “Republic of China Women’s Anti-Communist and Anti-Russian Federation.” As an official, anti-communist body, its members—educated mainland émigré women—focused on supporting the military and promoting traditional roles of “dutiful wives and mothers,” organizing military tribute events, model mother awards, sewing cooperatives, and parental training.</li><li>The Central Women’s Work Committee (“Fugonghui”), also led by Chiang, pursued similar goals of upholding state stability and promoting the ideal of the virtuous wife and mother. Until martial law’s lifting, these two bodies shaped Taiwan’s official women’s activism.</li></ul><p><strong>Lu’s New Feminism</strong></p><p>Taiwanese society long boxed women into the roles of dutiful wife, gentle homemaker, and the like. Lu’s mother taught her instead: “At home, do women’s work; outside, do men’s work.” Women need no imposed limits.</p><ul><li>1971: At age 27, while a law student at National Taiwan University, Lu delivered a speech titled “Isn’t It Time to End Male-Centered Society?” directly challenging Taiwan’s patriarchal norms and official women’s groups.</li><li>1972: She coined New Feminism, encapsulating three core ideas: 1) Be human first, then man or woman; 2) Define by essence, not mere role; 3) Let each person fully realize their talents.</li></ul><p>Lu saw New Feminism not as a “movement” but as a necessary, era-driven philosophy to achieve substantive equality, blend modern values with personal integrity, and dissolve traditional prejudices. She believed that pursuing women’s rights mirrored the broader human rights struggle, centered on independence, freedom, and equality—principles equally applicable to men and women.</p><p><strong>Building Institutions</strong></p><p>During this period, Lu founded numerous organizations: the Era Women’s Association, Pioneers’ Home, the Taipei chapter of the International Federation of Business and Professional Women, “Protect You” hotline, and more. Through these, she rallied women to pursue collective empowerment and bring Taiwan’s women’s movement to its peak.</p><p><strong>Facing Criticism and Persistence</strong></p><p>Just as she fought for democracy, Lu tirelessly championed her values, despite criticism—accusations of shirking “womanly duties,” curses that she’d never marry, even claims of psychological deviance. Yet she never backed down, believing that true reform always encounters resistance.</p><p>She also received support from male allies: “I admire your courage—pioneers walk alone,” “New Feminism is a pillar of societal stability,” and offers of male volunteers. Such encouragement strengthened Lu amid adversity.</p><p><strong>Legacy and Continuing Progress</strong></p><p>The 1979 Formosa Incident temporarily silenced Lu and New Feminism when she was imprisoned. However, after martial law ended, Taiwan saw a new wave of women’s activism—anti–child prostitution campaigns, abortion rights, workplace equality, bodily autonomy, marriage reform—all broadening public understanding of equality and human rights. While Taiwan’s journey remains ongoing, its steady progress stands as Lu’s enduring legacy.</p></div>`)

This marks the third time since 2000 that Chen has either invited a Chinese leader to Taiwan or expressed willingness to meet, though previous invitations have been ignored by China.</p><p>Chen Shui-bian believes that Chinese authorities are unlikely to invite him to Beijing. He pointed out that past invitations extended to figures such as Lien Chan and Song Chu-yu came with conditions. In contrast, he argued that Hu Jintao should visit Taiwan without any prerequisites.</p><p>He elaborated:</p><blockquote>“If I were to go to Beijing, they would certainly demand that I accept the so-called ‘One China’ principle and the concept of ‘ultimate unification.’ However, when the Taiwanese government and I invite President Hu Jintao to Taiwan, we do not set any preconditions—such as requiring him to acknowledge that Taiwan is a sovereign independent state, not a part of China, or not a local government of the People’s Republic of China. We have no conditions; we welcome him to come.”</blockquote><h4>Hope for a Meeting</h4><p>Chen Shui-bian expressed that, given the opportunity to speak face-to-face with Hu Jintao, he would tell him that he does not understand Taiwan well enough.</p><p>He also suggested that Chinese authorities should consider adopting the unification model of East and West Germany for cross-strait relations. “In the past, I have repeatedly mentioned the integration model of the European Union and the unification model of East and West Germany. These are certainly worth President Hu Jintao’s consideration and reference, rather than outright rejection,” he said.</p><p>He further cautioned that if China persists in denying Taiwan’s status as a sovereign independent state, continues to threaten it with force, or seeks to belittle, localize, marginalize, or delegitimize the Taiwanese government—stripping it of its authority or even its governmental status—these actions will only widen the gap between the two sides.</p><p>President Chen concluded by stressing that if China demonstrates sincerity and if President Hu Jintao is willing, he is prepared to represent the Taiwanese government and its people in sincerely inviting Hu to visit Taiwan.</p></div>`)

However, Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice today (July 19) denied these claims, and KMT figures continue to question the case’s lingering mysteries.</p><p>On Tuesday (the 19th), Taiwan’s <em>China Times</em> ran a prominent report stating that investigators have completed a roughly 100,000–word report on the 3/19 shooting and plan to announce its conclusion by the end of this month. The report also noted that, after naming 64-year-old Chen Yi-hsiung as the suspect at a March 7 press conference, authorities faced public doubt due to a lack of eyewitnesses and physical evidence from the scene. In response, the task force launched a thorough review of those leads and has made significant progress.</p><p>Investigators claim to have interviewed more than five witnesses who place Chen Yi-hsiung in the “firing zone” at the time of the attack. These witnesses include the owners and employees of a clothing shop at the scene, as well as two sisters who were waiting by the roadside for Chen Shui-bian’s campaign motorcade.</p><p>According to the leaked summary, the report concludes that the shooting was “not self-inflicted or staged,” that Chen Yi-hsiung acted alone with “no accomplices,” and that his motive was dissatisfaction with the political situation. Chen Yi-hsiung allegedly drowned in a fishing port on March 28 of that year—suspected to have been a suicide to escape punishment.</p><p>After these details appeared in the press, Deputy Minister of Justice Tang Chin-chuan denied them on Tuesday, stating that the investigation is ongoing, with no timetable for closure, and that the media reports “do not match the facts.”</p><p>Regarding the purported five eyewitnesses and whether Chen Yi-hsiung’s death leaves “no one to contradict the findings,” Tang said that, because the investigation is confidential, he cannot comment publicly, but any official results will be released through a formal press briefing by the task force.</p><p>Meanwhile, the KMT has responded that, regardless of how many witnesses the DPP government presents, the case’s mysteries remain unsolved and its political manipulations unexplained.</p><p>The 3/19 shooting continues to affect Taiwan’s political landscape. The attack occurred on March 19 last year—the day before Taiwan’s presidential election—when President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu were lightly wounded in Tainan while campaigning; they then narrowly defeated the opposition Lien Chan ticket the next day. The KMT has long questioned the case’s “clouds of doubt” and filed an electoral lawsuit.</p><p>The incident is widely seen as having decisively influenced the 2004 election and has since eroded trust between the parties. KMT chairman Lien Chan, currently visiting the United States, told overseas compatriots that the 3/19 shooting is “a joke” and that the Blue Camp will continue fighting to uncover the “truth.”</p></div>`)

He added that he hopes to lead a congratulatory delegation to Taiwan for the inauguration ceremony on May 20.</p><p>Representative DeLay began by offering his sympathies for the President’s gunshot wounds and congratulating him on being elected the Republic of China’s eleventh President. “When I first heard the news of the shooting,” DeLay said, “I was deeply concerned and prayed sincerely for your speedy recovery. You are the President of Taiwan’s nation, and winning such a hard-fought election deserves the highest recognition and support of the American people.”</p><p>DeLay went on to say that Taiwan’s democracy and President Chen’s struggle to establish it have served as a profound inspiration to the American people. “For the People’s Republic of China and many other nations,” he continued, “Taiwan stands as a true democracy. My colleagues and I in the Congress will give President Chen our unconditional support.” He concluded by extending his best wishes for a smooth and successful new term.</p><p>In response, President Chen thanked Representative DeLay for his concern and congratulations. The President recounted that, when the shooting occurred, he initially believed the injury was caused by firecrackers and intended to continue campaigning and attend that evening’s rally, only later learning at the hospital that he had been shot. President Chen also informed DeLay that the Central Election Commission will officially announce the winners of the presidential and vice-presidential election today.</p><p>The President added that he is grateful for divine protection of Taiwan—that he and Vice President Lu were not more seriously harmed. “Over the past four years,” he said, “your support, Congressman DeLay, has greatly advanced U.S.–Taiwan relations. I am deeply thankful, and I look forward to your continued support over the next four years—particularly regarding Taiwan’s participation in the World Health Organization and the further strengthening of U.S.–Taiwan ties.”</p><p>President Chen also expressed his hope that Representative DeLay can personally lead a delegation to the May 20 inauguration, so that old friends may meet again. “It would mean so much to me,” he said, “as though it were God’s will.”</p><p>Representative DeLay replied that it would be his honor to attend the inauguration with a delegation. He noted that the U.S. Congress will host a 25th-anniversary celebration of the Taiwan Relations Act in April, during which the House plans to pass legislation urging the U.S. State Department to provide greater assistance for Taiwan’s participation in the World Health Organization. “My colleagues and I,” DeLay said, “will do everything we can to ensure the world understands America’s full support for Taiwan’s entry into the WHO.”</p><p>President Chen once again thanked DeLay, observing that Taiwan’s WHO participation affects the health and welfare of its 23 million citizens and symbolizes an important step toward normalizing cross-Strait relations. “Improvement in cross-Strait ties,” he said, “should begin with public health.”</p><p>Finally, President Chen thanked Representative DeLay for his greetings to the First Lady, Ms. Wu Shu-chen. He expressed his admiration for her composure following the shooting and said he looks forward to seeing his longtime friend at the inauguration on May 20. “We will always be the best of friends,” he concluded.</p></div>`)

This assertion overturns all established political science theory.</p><p>In recent years, Taiwan’s political scene has exhibited a bizarre phenomenon: whenever an election approaches, politicians seem to lose all reason—even basic common sense. But the Legislative Yuan campaign this time was truly over the top. President Chen not only redefined the very idea of a “coup,” he went so far as to coin the term “soft coup,” flying in the face of every political science principle.</p><p>Chen’s so-called “soft coup” claims that, after the March 20 election, KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP Chairman Song Chu-yu used retired generals to approach serving senior officers, persuading them to resign, retire, or feign illness—thereby shaking the army’s loyalty.</p><p>Perhaps only Taiwan’s politicians rank so low in political IQ. In any Third World country, if the military were planning a coup, would they first disarm themselves—threatening to resign or take leave? That hardly qualifies as a “coup.” Any would-be strongman who tries such tactics must be either brain-damaged or mentally unstable—and Chen himself need not worry.</p><p>More absurdly, DPP legislator Li Wen-chung hinted that three full generals and eight lieutenant generals have already been approached to resign, joking that the numbers add up to a “38 Coup.” Given how politicized Taiwan’s officer corps has become, if a large number of senior officers really were incited to resign, the opposite would occur: morale would soar. Vacancies at the rank of general and lieutenant general would be a boon to the mid-level officers waiting in line—and would only deepen their loyalty to President Chen.</p></div>`)

In 2000, Lee publicly endorsed Chen just in time to help propel him into the presidency. In 2004, as the Chen You-hau fundraising scandal put Chen’s campaign in peril, Lee joined Chen at a joint press conference 48 hours before the election to rally support, famously urging, “Don’t kill a man over one small flaw.” Today, however, their relationship has cooled considerably.</p><p><strong>2000: Timely Endorsement</strong></p><p>On <strong>March 10, 2000</strong>, after three invitations, Lee Yuan-tseh finally declared his support for Chen Shui-bian. Nine days later, Chen won the presidency.</p><blockquote>Lee Yuan-tseh (March 10, 2000): “I affirm Mr. Chen’s past efforts. I believe in his approach to eradicating the black-gold system and pushing reforms. I accepted his invitation to serve as a national policy advisor.”</blockquote><p><strong>2004: Crisis and Counsel</strong></p><p>In the wake of the Chen You-hau affair, Chen Shui-bian’s reelection bid became precarious. <strong>48 hours before</strong> the March 20 election, Lee and Chen held a joint press conference.</p><blockquote>Lee Yuan-tseh (March 18, 2004): “No sage or hero is without shortcomings, but let us not seize upon a minor fault to destroy a person.”</blockquote><p><strong>A Waning Alliance</strong></p><p>For two consecutive elections, Lee stood by Chen at every pivotal moment, delivering crucial support. Yet as Chen’s presidency extended, the two have grown increasingly distant. Recently, Lee published an open letter urging President Chen to reconsider his continuation in office. Rather than respond with a press conference, Chen replied via text message with a brief three-sentence note: “Thank you for your advice.”</p><p><strong>Eroding Support Among Advisers</strong></p><p>Lee Yuan-tseh was chief advisor of the 2000 National Policy Advisory Group, but he is not the only member to withdraw his backing. Of the original 15 advisors—including Evergreen Group chairman Chang Yung-fa, Chi Mei Group chairman Hsu Wen-lung, Academia Sinica member Tseng Chi-lang, pro-independence figure Kao Chih-ming, and former CCK University president Cheng Kuo-shun—at least six have since distanced themselves from Chen.

General Allen’s remarks reflected carefully coordinated messaging between the U.S. State and Defense Departments:</p><blockquote>“As Taiwan faces the growing military power of the People’s Republic of China and an increasingly severe security environment, it is vital that Taiwan’s political leaders reach cross-party agreement on increasing defense spending to meet these threats.”</blockquote><p>At the hand-over ceremony, the esprit de corps among the ROC Navy personnel was unmistakable: camaraderie was high, discipline was evident, and morale was soaring.

Despite his heart being propped open with multiple stents and a history of gout in his left foot, doctors reported that Lee’s blood pressure, body temperature, and cardiac function all fall within normal ranges—testimony to his overall good health. Accordingly, Lee has announced—via close associates—that he will cancel his planned autumn trip to Japan for further cardiac treatment, since his stents are functioning normally. (Unofficial sources claim Tokyo denied his visa under pressure from Beijing.) This announcement is a welcome boon to the Taiwan Solidarity Union, which already enjoys favorable polls, and further bolsters its confidence ahead of this year’s legislative elections.</p><p>The TSU regards the upcoming end-of-year legislative vote as its most critical battle against the “bubble party” curse. To win, the party must leverage every ounce of the Lee Teng-hui effect. On one hand, like the People First Party, the TSU is unmistakably a one-man party: members fear that once Lee’s influence vanishes, the party’s cohesion will collapse and supporters scatter. At eighty-one years old, with stents made of materials later linked to serious health risks, Lee’s remaining years of unifying charisma are a constant concern. On the other hand, TSU insiders hope to transcend the one-man model by transforming into an ideology-driven party that can stand on its own and avoid “bubble” status. Lee himself has tacitly approved this vision, pushing the TSU to brand its legislative campaign under the banner of “Constitutional Reform & Formal Recognition,” sharply distinguishing itself from the DPP. This campaign will likely be the TSU’s last chance to ride Lee’s halo; future elections—next year’s mayoral races and the subsequent Taipei and Kaohsiung municipal votes—will see either TSU absence or diminished impact, as Lee’s star fades. Thus, the TSU must seize this final legislative election opportunity to cement its transformation: from a personality cult into an ideology-based party capable of enduring beyond Lee’s era.</p><p>Taiwan’s broader political currents are aiding the TSU’s transition. After the DPP made “referendum-based constitutional reform” President Chen Shui-bian’s campaign centerpiece last December, the DPP itself began to drift toward the TSU’s platform, eroding the TSU’s distinct political territory. In response, when the pro–Taiwan independence coalition led the “2·28 Hand-in-Hand to Save Taiwan” campaign, the TSU vehemently opposed any joint inauguration ceremony with President Chen, insisting on strict separation from the DPP to protect its own voter base in the legislative elections.</p><p>Meanwhile, Chen Shui-bian’s “20 May Address,” under intense domestic and international pressure, shelved his original “2006 referendum on a new constitution, 2008 implementation” plan in favor of more moderate “constitutional reforms.” Though this disappointed the TSU, it also removed the threat of DPP encroachment on their platform, clearing the way for the TSU to become the “third-largest party” after the legislative vote. Indeed, in a recent Kaohsiung city council by-election, all four TSU candidates won—both proof of the TSU’s successful transformation strategy and a significant morale boost ahead of the legislative contest.</p><p>In the upcoming election, the TSU may enjoy a “win-win” scenario. Disgruntled DPP supporters upset by the withdrawal of the referendum plan may be drawn to the TSU’s “Constitutional Reform & Recognition” platform. Simultaneously, “localist” KMT voters, seeing little hope for a blue comeback, may abandon the KMT in favor of the TSU, viewed as the true defender of local interests. If both trends materialize, the TSU could significantly increase its seat share and vote share—potentially emerging as the campaign’s biggest winner.</p><p>However, because the TSU currently commands only 7.76 % of the vote and 5.78 % of seats, even large percentage gains will not yield proportional seat increases. The three larger parties—the DPP, KMT, and PFP—remain far ahead. Yet with the KMT weakened by TSU inroads and the PFP’s sheen fading alongside Song Chu-yu’s star, the TSU may close the gap with one of the two “Pan-Blue” parties.</p><p>Although the DPP won the presidency—thanks in part to the TSU’s decision not to field a presidential candidate—the legislature will be a different fight. The TSU will not hold back in the legislative race; it will aggressively court both disappointed DPP and opportunistic KMT localist voters. This will severely limit the DPP’s room for growth in the legislature, making it unrealistic for the DPP alone to secure a majority. However, a combined DPP–TSU seat total could surpass the 50 % threshold, fulfilling the rallying cry, “Majority seats make governance easier, secure a great leap forward.” Once the TSU becomes the pivotal minority, it may leverage its position to extract concessions from the DPP, subjecting the DPP to continued political bargaining. Consequently, the DPP’s days in the legislature may be no less fractious than in opposition, with the TSU acting as a potent check on its power.</p></div>`)

Following the dissolution, the DPP will prohibit factions from establishing offices, recruiting members, raising funds externally, holding member meetings, or inviting government officials to report in the name of factions. Party officials will also be required to withdraw from factions during their term of office. For the DPP, with its long and complex history of factions, this dissolution is indeed a major move and not an easy one. Factional co-governance has been the most distinctive characteristic of the DPP and the pillar of its party management.</p><h4>The Five Major Factions</h4><p>Currently, there are five major factions within the DPP:</p><ol><li><strong>New Tide Faction</strong>: Existing since the party’s founding, it is currently the most powerful faction within the DPP.</li><li><strong>Justice Alliance</strong>: Founded by Chen Shui-bian in 1992, it serves as his main support base within the party.</li><li><strong>Welfare State Faction</strong>: Represented by figures such as Hsieh Chang-ting and Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chang Chun-hsiung.</li><li><strong>Taiwan Independence Alliance</strong>: Primarily composed of Taiwan independence activists who returned to Taiwan after 1991.</li><li><strong>Pan-Beautiful Island Faction</strong>: The Beautiful Island Faction and the New Tide Faction were the two major factions at the party’s inception, with former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh as a representative figure. It is further divided into the New Dynamics Office and the New Century Office.</li></ol><h4>Chen Shui-bian and Factional Politics</h4><p>When Chen Shui-bian came to power in 2000, he used factions to consolidate his authority, striving to become the "de facto political leader and factional overlord" within the DPP. He was deeply engaged in manipulating factional politics. Notably, the "Justice Alliance," as Chen’s direct lineage, rose prominently and became the most powerful ruling faction within the party, also holding the most legislative seats. In May 2000, the "Justice Alliance," "Welfare State Alliance," "New Dynamics," and "Taiwan Independence Alliance" within the DPP formed the "Mainstream Alliance," officially ushering in an era of factional alliances and coalitions after the party assumed power.</p><p>However, as time passed, Chen Shui-bian found it increasingly difficult to balance the interests among the factions. Starting in 2002, as the DPP gradually gained control of administrative resources on the island, internal power struggles intensified. Chen’s failure to control the Legislative Yuan was a clear manifestation of this escalating internal conflict, highlighting his inability to reconcile the interests of the various DPP factions. The 2002 election results for the DPP’s Legislative Yuan caucus leadership were particularly embarrassing for Chen. Despite the "Justice Alliance" being touted as the largest faction within the DPP, their candidate, Chen Chi-mai, lost, while veteran female legislator Hsu Jung-shu won with the highest votes and bluntly stated that this was a warning to Chen’s loyalists.</p><p>Nevertheless, Chen Shui-bian was wary of the factions’ influence. In 2004, there was a strong call within the party to dissolve factions, but Chen managed to suppress it. However, factional politics did not spare him any favor.</p><h4>Corruption Scandals and Factional Struggles</h4><p>This time, embroiled in corruption scandals, Chen Shui-bian has triggered fierce factional struggles within the DPP. Some factions have taken an unusually harsh stance in criticizing Chen, completely out of step with his government policies. Moreover, the factions cannot reach a consensus on the party’s direction. It can be said that in recent times, factional struggles within the DPP have dominated Taiwan’s political stage.</p><p>On July 18, the DPP’s "New Tide Faction" proposed that Chen Shui-bian should face party discipline, igniting mutual attacks among factions. Legislators from Chen’s faction held a press conference criticizing the "New Tide" for having "a few bad apples," to which the "New Tide" immediately retorted, accusing Chen’s legislators of acting like "imperial disciples," a behavior they deemed disgraceful. This example alone shows that factional struggles within the DPP have reached a boiling point, becoming brutal and chaotic.</p><h4>Potential Consequences</h4><p>Intense factional struggles have already severely damaged the DPP. If they persist, the consequences could be dire, at least in the following ways:</p><ol><li>The DPP could face a substantial split, unable to unite.</li><li>Chen Shui-bian could become completely lame-duck within the party, unable to act effectively.</li><li>The ruling DPP could suffer from significant internal strife, hindering effective governance.</li><li>It could seriously impact the year-end mayoral elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung.</li></ol><p>Dissolving factions is likely something Chen Shui-bian desperately desires.</p><h4>Implications of Dissolution</h4><p>After the dissolution of factions, the DPP will undoubtedly enter a phase with less dissent, weaker criticism, reduced checks and balances, diminished democratic will, and weakened capacity for self-reflection. Such a DPP would be more passive than proactive, more blind than clear-sighted. Consequently, dangers will become significantly more pronounced.</p><p>With the factional obstacles within the party removed, Chen Shui-bian can free up his hands to act. What will he do? Will he continue to push for de jure Taiwan independence? Will he persist in provocative actions that strain cross-strait and Sino-US relations? It’s not certain, but it’s not impossible. From Chen Shui-bian’s recent remarks, there seem to be hints of thunder and lightning again. In the future, when the DPP is silenced, Chen Shui-bian’s voice will be the loudest! If this prediction holds true, a crisis across the Taiwan Strait could suddenly emerge!</p></div>`)

Following a high-level national security meeting this afternoon, the President ordered the NUC’s operations to be “terminated,” effective as soon as tomorrow. During the session, he repeatedly stressed that Taiwan has no intention of changing the cross-Strait status quo—and made clear that the mainland likewise must not alter it. The Presidential Office noted with irony that Beijing had once criticized the NUC’s charter as advocating Sun Yat-sen’s Three Principles of the People for China’s unification, then condemned the move to “abolish unification” as de facto “legal independence”—a clear case of shooting itself in the foot.</p><p>Rushed through on the eve of the February 28 holiday and timed after the stock market closed, the decision was formally recorded as “terminating the operations” of the NUC.</p><blockquote>President Chen Shui-bian: “The National Unification Council’s operations shall be terminated and its budget will no longer be allocated. Personnel originally responsible for its functions will return to their ministries. The National Unification Guidelines shall cease to apply, and in accordance with procedure, will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for record.”</blockquote><p>By choosing “terminate” rather than “abolish,” the administration deftly addressed U.S. concerns over whether the cross-Strait status quo would change.</p><blockquote>President Chen Shui-bian: “Taiwan does not intend to change the status quo, and firmly opposes any non-peaceful means that would alter it. The termination of the NUC’s operations and the Guidelines’ applicability does not affect the status quo; it is founded on the democratic principle that sovereignty rests with the people.”</blockquote><p>If maintaining the status quo is a present-tense action, could a new-constitution referendum become a future-tense one?</p><blockquote>President Chen Shui-bian: “Any push for constitutional reform must follow a bottom-up, outside-in process, requiring a three-quarters Legislative Yuan vote and confirmation by popular referendum. Any sovereignty issue not following this procedure not only fails to preserve the status quo but will not be addressed.”</blockquote><p>The high threshold for a constitutional-reform referendum remains unchanged. The President also made clear that the mainland must similarly refrain from attempting to alter the status quo.</p><p>President Chen used this announcement both to allay U.S. concerns and to chastise Beijing. He noted historical irony: Beijing once attacked the NUC’s charter as Taiwan’s attempt to unify China under Sun Yat-sen’s Three Principles—yet now condemns its termination as de facto independence. “Isn’t Beijing just slapping itself in the face?” he asked.</p><p>In a surprising final twist, President Chen released a recorded video of the announcement, formally conveying his decision to terminate the National Unification Guidelines and bringing to a close the month-long controversy.</p></div>`)

His trip to Rome angered Beijing, as China has always regarded Taiwan as a province of China and seeks to limit Taiwan's diplomatic space. Currently, among European countries, only the Vatican maintains relations with Taiwan. Amid Chen's visit, there has been speculation that the Vatican may be preparing to shift recognition to mainland China.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;">Angry Reaction</h4><p>Chinese authorities reacted strongly to Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian's attendance at the Pope's funeral in the Vatican. On Friday, April 8, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Qin Gang stated, "Chen Shui-bian's trip to the Vatican to attend the Pope's funeral is, in reality, an attempt to engage in separatist activities promoting 'two Chinas' or 'one China, one Taiwan' on the international stage, which China firmly opposes." Qin added that China has expressed strong dissatisfaction with both the Vatican and Italy regarding the visa issuance, urging Italian authorities to take concrete steps to prevent similar incidents in the future, in consideration of the broader China-Italy relationship. Since the Vatican is located within Italy, visitors must transit through Italy, and in this case, Italy granted Chen a visa. Regarding the development of China-Vatican relations, Qin emphasized that China's two fundamental principles remain unchanged and consistent. China hopes the Vatican will take practical steps to improve relations rather than create new obstacles.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;">Officials Accompanying</h4><p>President Chen's China Airlines charter flight arrived in Rome, Italy, at 0:55 a.m. local time on Friday. He was accompanied by Taiwan's Ambassador to the Vatican, Tu Chu-sheng, and greeted by Vatican officials upon arrival. The delegation also included Foreign Minister Mark Chen, two priests, and an Islamic imam. Taiwan's authorities described the trip as a "journey of peace and remembrance." Chen Shui-bian is the first Taiwanese president to visit the Vatican. He and his delegation will stay in the Vatican for no more than 24 hours. After attending the Pope's funeral on Friday, Chen will meet with members of the Taiwanese delegation to console staff at the Taiwanese embassy to the Vatican before departing for Taiwan, arriving back on Saturday. Taiwanese authorities have placed great importance on the president's attendance at the funeral, viewing it as a diplomatic breakthrough for Taiwan. According to Taiwan's Central News Agency, Chen was seated in the fourth seat of the first row in the area reserved for heads of state. Before entering the funeral, he had a brief conversation with U.S. President George W. Bush and former President Bill Clinton. Taiwan currently has approximately 300,000 Catholics. A BBC Taiwan affairs correspondent noted that although Chen's visit is brief, it provides an excellent opportunity for diplomatic publicity. In addition to official Chinese reactions, officials from the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association also responded to Chen's visit to the Vatican, stating, "Allowing Chen Shui-bian to attend the funeral has hurt the feelings of the Chinese people, including China's five million Catholics."</p><p><br></p></div>`)

Punkgod, hailing from Jiangxi Province, is deemed a troublemaker by Beijing for advocating independence. To avoid interception by hostile actors, they went to great lengths before finally reaching Taiwan. Standing in the plaza before the Presidential Office, Punkgod threw their arms up and cheered excitedly:</p><blockquote>“No matter what happens back home, as long as we’ve made it to Taiwan, we’re winners!”</blockquote><h3>Chthonic Roots, Covert Journey to Taiwan</h3><p>Punkgod is a well-known underground Chinese punk-rock band that champions human rights, freedom, and revolution. Through their lyrics, they criticize China’s social injustices and urge people not to accept oppression but to learn to resist and reclaim the rights that belong to them. They frequently publish independent commentary online—publicly supporting Chechen and Tibetan independence—even when their posts are repeatedly deleted. Undeterred, Punkgod reposts on over twenty websites to fight for free speech.</p><p>Consequently, Beijing views Punkgod as troublesome dissidents. Many mainstream Chinese singers and bands refuse to share the stage with them for fear of attracting trouble.</p><p>This time, Punkgod accepted an invitation from Freddy—head of the concert organizer TRA (Taiwan Rock Alliance)—to publicly endorse the February 28 concert. To ensure their safe arrival, Freddy devised a tight security plan and guarded against any leaks so that Punkgod would not become “the second Sean Connery” unable to enter Taiwan.</p><h3>Midnight Arrival, First Mainland Band in Taiwan</h3><p>Just after 11 PM on February 25, Punkgod finally set foot in Taiwan—the first mainland Chinese band ever to perform here.</p><p>Frontman and guitarist Ao Bo—the band’s soul—and bassist Duan Xinjun arrived with a brand-new song titled “Defend Taiwan.” Ao Bo laughed as he explained why drummer Chen Bin couldn’t join them: because Chen is from Jingdezhen, and some Jingdezhen residents had angered Beijing by selling fake antique porcelain in Southeast Asia. As a result, all Jingdezhen natives have recently been barred from traveling abroad—an absurd but inescapable rule. To reach Taiwan, Punkgod even staged a “fake vacation” in Thailand—a challenging journey indeed.</p><h3>A “Fake” Vacation to Defend Taiwan on 2/28</h3><p>Ao Bo recalled meeting Freddy (also vocalist of Chthonic) three years ago at the Kunming Music Festival. Sharing the same political ideals, they became fast friends. Although they had long wanted to join Taiwan’s indie music events like Formoz, Punkgod was blacklisted as troublesome, and applying for Beijing’s approval to travel to Taiwan was prohibitively complex.</p><p>When they learned they could take part in the February 28 commemorations, Ao Bo vowed to overcome every obstacle. Freddy secured cultural-worker visas sent to Thailand, and Ao Bo and Duan Xinjun traveled under the pretext of tourism before transferring to Taiwan.</p><h3>Honoring 2/28 History</h3><p>Ao Bo’s first act in Taiwan was to visit February 28 historical sites. He donned a “Taiwan Soul” T-shirt for a commemorative photo in front of the Presidential Office, emphasizing that he genuinely supports Taiwan’s sovereign independence, not mere subordination. Though he didn’t know what price he might pay—especially after performing at a 2/28 memorial—Ao Bo remained undaunted:</p><blockquote>“I don’t care if I face persecution. The most important thing is that I’m in Taiwan. As long as I made it here, I’m the big winner!”</blockquote><h3>A Taste of Taiwan’s Sour Plum Juice</h3><p>Stopping by the famous sour plum juice stand beside 2/28 Peace Park, Ao Bo took a sip and praised its unique flavor. Pointing at the peaceful faces and clean streets, he said:</p><blockquote>“Look at these people—they’re so calm, the streets so clean. We were taught that our Taiwanese compatriots lived in dire misery, so we had to ‘liberate’ Taiwan. If there really was something to liberate, wouldn’t that be a big joke?”</blockquote></div>`)

The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is scheduled to hold its national convention on July 15 and 16, with the disbandment of factions poised to be a central issue. Reports indicate that the DPP's central leadership is prepared to dissolve these factions, and any violations could result in disciplinary action from the party.</p><p>According to aggregated reports from Taiwanese media, DPP legislator Wang Hsing-nan recently revisited the idea of "disbanding factions." His goal is to curb the expanding influence of Su Tseng-chang and the New Tide faction. Rumors suggest that, to prevent the "New Tide" from gaining further dominance, the "Justice Alliance" and "Welfare State" factions have formed an alliance to support Hsieh Chang-ting in opposing both the "New Tide" and Su Tseng-chang.</p><p>Wang Hsing-nan had previously raised the issue of disbanding factions at the last national convention, but the DPP central leadership took no concrete action. This time, with renewed momentum, the central leadership has privately expressed approval and made it clear that "rigid factions"—those with offices and organized cadres—will not be tolerated. The "New Tide," "Justice Alliance," and "Welfare State" factions all fall under this category, with the "New Tide" considered the most "rigid." The DPP’s bold move to rein in the New Tide has sparked discontent within the faction, potentially worsening relations between Su Tseng-chang and Yu Hsi-kun, and further intensifying internal party conflicts.</p><p>Core party and government figures report that over 90% of DPP representatives nationwide support disbanding factions. During the previous convention, it was Chen Shui-bian, then at the peak of his popularity, who forcibly suppressed this proposal. "Can (DPP Chairman) You si-kun suppress it now?" they ask. The central leadership can no longer sidestep the issue and must confront it head-on.</p><p>Sources reveal that the DPP’s proposed measures for disbanding factions classify any intra-party group with a rigid structure, charter, and cadres as a faction—essentially "a party within the party"—which will not be permitted. However, it is deemed acceptable for like-minded individuals within a single parliamentary body to form policy discussion groups. Should these groups extend alliances across central and local public or party positions, they would also be classified as factions and banned.</p><p>The "New Tide" faction, seen as the primary target, has already begun crisis management. Key figure Duan Yi-kang issued a stern warning, accusing the central leadership of avoiding the party’s real problems and scapegoating factions instead. "Once faction disbandment is approved," he declared, "the New Tide may not need to remain a faction within the DPP!" Duan declined to elaborate on what a "New Tide outside the DPP" might mean, stating only that it "could be a magazine society or a people’s organization."</p><p>Duan Yi-kang further argued that the DPP’s current struggles are not the result of any single faction’s existence. If disbanding factions is viewed as a solution, he questioned whether the party leadership’s wisdom "exceeds imagination."</p><hr/><h3>News Background: Distribution of Factions within the DPP</h3><p>The DPP emerged as a coalition of "outside party forces" united against the Kuomintang’s (KMT) one-party dominance. From its inception, it has been characterized by diverse political ideologies and interpersonal networks, laying the groundwork for its factional divisions.</p><p>Initially, the party consisted primarily of the "Beautiful Island" faction, the "New Tide" faction, and non-aligned figures. Over the course of its development, the DPP has seen continuous shifts in factional power and realignments. The "Beautiful Island" faction, after facing multiple ideological clashes and challenges from emerging factions like the "Justice Alliance" and "Welfare State Alliance," eventually dissolved and reorganized. With numerous factions within the party, internal struggles have remained fierce.</p><p>After years in power, the DPP’s factional dynamics have shifted significantly. Today, the party is dominated by two major forces: Chen Shui-bian’s loyal "Justice Alliance" and the "New Tide" faction, which controls multiple county magistrate and government official positions. Other smaller factions wield limited influence.</p><h4>Main Factions within the DPP:</h4><ul><li><strong>"New Tide" Faction</strong>: Present since the party’s founding and currently closely aligned with Chen Shui-bian, this faction is built around the editorial and writing staff of <em>New Tide</em> magazine. Its core platform emphasizes "Taiwan independence," mass movements, and social democracy. With a clear agenda and robust factional discipline, it is the most powerful group within the party. Key figures include Chiu Yi-jen, former Secretary-General of the Presidential Office and current Secretary-General of the National Security Council.</li><li><strong>"Justice Alliance"</strong>: Established by Chen Shui-bian in 1992, this faction serves as his primary power base within the party.</li><li><strong>"Welfare State Alliance"</strong>: Represented by figures such as former DPP Chairman and Premier Hsieh Chang-ting, and Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chang Chun-hsiung.</li><li><strong>"New Dynamics Office"</strong>: Led by former legislator Hsu Jung-shu.</li><li><strong>"Taiwan Independence" Alliance</strong>: Comprising "Taiwan independence" advocates who returned to Taiwan after 1991, represented by former DPP Deputy Secretary-General Lee Ying-yuan.</li><li><strong>"New Century Office"</strong>: Led by Chang Chun-hung, current Vice Chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation and one of the DPP’s founding elders.</li></ul><p>To counter the formidable political mobilization of the "New Tide," the "Justice Alliance," "Welfare State Alliance," "New Dynamics Office," and "Taiwan Independence" Alliance have formed a loose coalition known as the "Mainstream Alliance," making it a dominant force within the DPP. In contrast, the "New Tide" remains more cohesive and retains significant influence.</p><p>Additionally, the "Beautiful Island" faction, one of the two original major factions alongside the "New Tide," was led by former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh and other participants in the "Beautiful Island Incident." Its influence waned following Shih Ming-teh’s departure from the party in 1996 and Hsu Hsin-liang’s later exit, leaving it largely diminished.</p></div>`)

As a result, Chiu Yi is definitively ineligible to run in this year’s legislative elections. Chiu Yi said the verdict was within his expectations but nonetheless surprising, and that he plans to report for imprisonment after the current legislative session concludes.</p><p>Chiu Yi was accused of leading a crowd to storm the Kaohsiung District Prosecutor’s Office on March 21, 2004—one day after the presidential election results were announced—demanding that ballot boxes be sealed. The Kaohsiung High Court found that Chiu Yi ignored three dispersal orders from police, and in pursuit of sealing all ballot boxes, directed the mob from atop a command vehicle, shouting “Charge the courthouse gates!” He also ordered objects thrown at officers, endangering their lives and causing injuries to multiple policemen, in blatant contempt of judicial authority. The court convicted him as the ringleader under the charge of “organizing a crowd to obstruct official duties,” sentencing him to one year and two months’ imprisonment without suspension.</p><p>The Supreme Court’s December 22 ruling confirmed that the High Court’s verdict was sound and rejected Chiu Yi’s final appeal.</p><p>Upon hearing the verdict, Chiu Yi said he accepted it calmly, acknowledging that it fell within his expectations yet still left him astonished. He recalled the March 19, 2004 shooting, which he believes influenced the election outcome. At the time, crowds had gathered on Ketagalan Boulevard and outside courthouses nationwide, all awaiting the sealing of ballot boxes for a full recount. He felt he had no choice but to press prosecutors to secure the boxes as quickly as possible.</p><p>Reflecting on the swift handling of his case, Chiu Yi noted that in Taiwan’s democratic history, political demonstrations violating the Assembly and Parade Act typically result only in fines, suspended sentences, or retrials—not immediate imprisonment. The rapid progression of his trial, he said, came as a shock.</p></div>`)

Die-hard Fans Express Disappointment</h3><p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Reporter: Gu Shih-sheng, Chiayi – Published: 2008/08/26 17:28</strong></em></p><p>With the Chen family embroiled in a money laundering scandal, many of former President Chen Shui-bian’s loyal supporters (known as "Bian fans") are finding it hard to accept. So how are they dealing with the disappointment? In Chiayi, one passionate collector of figurines and a devoted Bian fan came up with a creative solution: he built a custom-made iron cage and locked up all his Chen Shui-bian figurines inside, labeling it the "Prison for Corrupt Officials," saying he wanted "A-Bian" to do some soul-searching.</p><p>One of the imprisoned figurines features Chen in a business suit with a majestic dragon coiled on his shoulder—once the favorite of Mr. Chen, the fan and collector who purchased it seven years ago. Along with another figurine wearing a "Bian" cap and one with a smiling face, they’re now all locked up in what he labeled the “Republic of China Prison for Corrupt Officials,” complete with a padlock to prevent escape.<br><br>Fan Chen Po-ru said, “After everything that’s happened, I figured it’s time for A-Bian to reflect a little.”</p><p>Chen, who serves as the executive director of a community college, began collecting figurines over a decade ago. He’s spent hundreds of thousands of NT dollars accumulating over a thousand pieces, and as a loyal Bian supporter, he naturally included Chen Shui-bian figurines in his collection. But now, with his idol caught in a money-laundering scandal, Chen is heartbroken—yet couldn’t bring himself to destroy his longtime collectibles. So, with help from a friend who works in metal fabrication, he spent a day building a custom cage as a humorous and symbolic way to vent his frustration.</p><p>Chen Po-ru said, “We welcome other Bian fans too—if you're upset but feel bad smashing your A-Bian figurines, you can bring them here and lock them up. Once you're feeling better, you can come pick them up and release them.”</p><p>Opposed to extreme political polarization, he wants people to express dissatisfaction in a lighthearted and humorous way. He not only invites fellow fans to send their A-Bian figurines to “prison,” but even plans to print mock parole certificates for those who want to retrieve them—saying it's his way of bearing witness to Taiwan’s democratic journey.</p></div>`)

Vice Premier Chiu Yi-jen, who as National Security Council Secretary-General led the aid initiative, said today (May 2) that he introduced financier Chin Chi-chiu to Foreign Minister Huang Chih-fang to promote diplomatic ties with Papua New Guinea—and that he must “take the greatest responsibility” for the debacle. Chiu emphasized that under normal circumstances he would resign, but with only about twenty days left in his term it would be “too cheap, too theatrical.” He vowed to submit to both political and judicial inquiries in the future.</p><p>When asked whether the PNG case was an isolated incident or part of a broader pattern, Chiu called it “an isolated case” and noted that while every diplomatic mission has its quirks, “this kind of truly outrageous mess” had never happened before. As for whether the NT$1 billion is still intact, Chiu said, “Last autumn Wu S-cai said the money was still there; as for now, I simply don’t know.”</p><p>Just before the Chen Shui-bian administration left office, the PNG recognition scandal broke. This morning, flanked by Information Bureau Director Hsieh Chih-wei, a smiling Chiu Yi-jen faced reporters and, in contrast to his usual reticence, answered every question about the foreign-aid scandal and welcomed criticism and guidance.</p><p>On the origins of the affair, Chiu explained that a “very good and trusted” friend had recommended Chin Chi-chiu to him. Chin claimed he had an opportunity to arrange diplomatic recognition with Papua New Guinea and introduced Chiu to Singaporean businessman Wu S-cai. Chiu then introduced Chin to Foreign Minister Huang, launching the effort to establish ties with PNG.</p><p>Although the Chen administration began pursuing PNG recognition in 2006, why was legal action only taken in April of this year—after nearly a year and a half? Chiu said that if Chin’s promises had been empty, the project would have been halted much earlier. Because progress was made and documents were even signed, they believed it could succeed. Only in 2007, when it became clear the requirements would not be met—and with memories of the 1999 PNG recognition that collapsed in three days and lost funds—they realized the project could not continue.</p><p>Chiu added that he had kept the matter secret at first to protect the fragile diplomatic channel. He and his contacts even tried locating Chin directly—one intermediary went to the U.S. to meet Chin’s wife—but without success. Only this year did Chiu pursue legal remedies, filing criminal charges and seeking civil injunctions to minimize damage.</p><p>Chiu admitted that he had trusted the friend who recommended Chin Chi-chiu and had not vetted Chin through national security channels, saying, “I blame myself.” He pledged to maintain this stance in any future political or judicial inquiry and to accept full responsibility: “There’s nothing to evade or avoid.” He also noted that he had informed President Chen Shui-bian of the PNG recognition process at every stage, and when problems arose, he had briefed the President, who instructed that the funds be recovered as quickly as possible.</p><p>When asked whether the trusted friend was a DPP member, Chiu refused to say, only stressing that President Chen also knew the friend. “The President trusted someone like me, and this happened—I feel terrible,” he said. He added that because the scandal broke just before Foreign Minister Huang Chih-fang’s term was to conclude on a high note, it was “like hurting him,” and he felt deeply sorry.</p></div>`)

Some TSU candidates accused the DPP of “vote allocation” schemes that unfairly diverted TSU votes to DPP candidates. Infighting within both Pan-Blue and Pan-Green coalitions has once again surfaced, leaving Taiwan’s political future in flux.</p></div>`)

I sincerely thank the people of Guatemala for their support during this time.”</p><p>Following negotiations by the Guatemalan government, the U.S. agreed to allow Portillo to return on a commercial flight rather than the standard U.S. government deportation plane used for illegal immigrants. His flight landed at La Aurora Airport in Guatemala City around 8 p.m. local time (02:00 GMT, February 26), where he was warmly welcomed by a large crowd of supporters.</p><p>The 63-year-old former president held a press conference in the VIP lounge before passing through customs as a regular traveler. Upon entry, he was immediately granted the security protection afforded to former presidents.</p><p>Accompanied by family, Portillo told the media, “Five years and one month have given me time to rethink and reflect. I return to my homeland like a prodigal son. The country is in poor condition, and I bear some responsibility. I was wrong!”</p><p>He announced that he has no intention of running for public office, as that is not his main goal, and emphasized his commitment to supporting reforms for a pluralistic movement.</p><p>Starting Wednesday morning, a group called the “National Portillista Front” (Frente Nacional Portillista, FNP) began gathering outside La Aurora International Airport, selling souvenirs and posters featuring Portillo’s image. By the time the flight arrived, approximately 2,000 people, including many indigenous residents from the Zacapa region, had gathered outside the airport’s arrivals hall and exit.</p><p>On February 14, 2004, a Guatemalan court revoked Portillo’s immunity as a former president, holding him accountable for embezzlement and money laundering. However, before a travel ban could reach border checkpoints, Portillo fled via the Pan-American Highway to El Salvador and later to Mexico.</p><p>After prolonged negotiations, Mexico’s Foreign Ministry agreed to Guatemala’s extradition request on October 30, 2006. However, due to judicial delays, Portillo was not repatriated on a special flight until October 7, 2008.</p><p>In 2007, Portillo filed a complaint with the Central American Court, alleging that the Guatemalan government illegally stripped him of the immunity he enjoyed as a former president and member of the Central American Parliament (PARLACEN), but his claim was unsuccessful.</p><p>In January 2010, a federal court in New York charged Portillo with laundering up to $70 million through U.S. banks, including $15 million in defense procurement funds and $2.5 million in cooperative funds donated by Taiwan for school libraries. The U.S. sought his extradition to New York for trial.</p><p>Upon learning of the U.S. extradition request, Portillo attempted to flee by sea from the Caribbean coast to neighboring Belize on January 26, 2010, but was apprehended. On August 26, 2011, Guatemala’s Constitutional Court ruled that the extradition request was constitutional.</p><p>On May 24, 2013, Portillo was flown to New York on a U.S. Department of Justice plane, becoming the first Guatemalan president to be extradited abroad for trial.</p><p>On March 18, 2014, during a hearing in New York, Portillo pleaded guilty before Judge James Patterson, admitting that a $2.5 million check from the “China International Commercial Bank” via Taiwan’s embassy in Guatemala was not part of a cooperative project but rather a diplomatic bribe from Chen Shui-bian’s administration to secure continued diplomatic relations. He noted that the check was made out in his name as evidence.</p><p>Three months later, Judge Patterson ruled that Portillo’s transfer of the $2.5 million in illicit funds to a third country through New York banks constituted money laundering. He was fined an equivalent amount and sentenced to 60 months in prison. Having already served 39 months in Guatemala, Portillo was released after serving 21 months in the U.S.</p><p>Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its ambassador to Guatemala, Sun Ta-cheng, repeatedly emphasized during Portillo’s indictment by the New York federal judge that the $2.5 million was misappropriated from cooperative project funds, and the diplomatic bribery allegations were untrue.</p><p>In Central America, a key region for Taiwan’s diplomatic relations, former Salvadoran President Francisco Flores also faced allegations of “misappropriating” $15 million in Taiwanese cooperative project funds during his 1999–2004 term. He fled for five months to avoid court summons but surrendered on September 5, 2014.</p></div>`)

The locker must be maintained at 18–22 °C and 45 % ± 10 % relative humidity. The locker door is fitted with dual electronic locks and requires simultaneous operation by two Level-3 (or higher) personnel for entry. Once weekly, the Psychology Team will inspect the interior for unauthorized attachments or signs of anomalous degradation.</p><p>Any removal or display of SCP-TW-2004 for non-testing purposes requires written approval from the O5 Council and the establishment of a 5 m “Emotional Amplification Containment Zone” around the containment chamber to prevent large-scale viewings from triggering “Taiwan Resonance” events. During approved testing, at least two Level-4 personnel must be present, and emergency sedatives must be on hand. Under no circumstances may SCP-TW-2004 be exhibited alongside other Taiwan-related artifacts or maps without prior authorization.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Description:</strong><br><br>SCP-TW-2004 is a life-like statuette approximately 12 cm in height, cast from plastic and resin. It depicts former Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian in formal attire, smiling and giving a thumbs-up, standing atop a miniature relief map of Taiwan. The front of the base bears the inscription “Rebuild Taiwan – Chen Shui-bian 2004.” The rear features a small plaque reading “Forge New Paths – Unity of All Hearts.”</p><p>The anomalous effect of SCP-TW-2004 activates upon the first engagement of its bottom magnetic mounting (i.e., when placed on display). Individuals (“subjects”) within a 10 m radius experience involuntary emotional resonance and a sudden urge to vocalize strong opinions or engage in heated discussion on sensitive topics such as Taiwanese unification, independence, or leadership succession. This “Taiwan Resonance” typically subsides within 30 minutes. However, if multiple subjects are exposed or gather around the object simultaneously, the effect intensifies proportionally and can induce large-scale emotional unrest among the population.</p><p>Further analysis has revealed a concealed micro-temporal emitter embedded within the base. This device periodically emits low-frequency “amplification pulses” at approximately 0.14 Hz. Spectral studies indicate these pulses resonate with human limbic emotional centers, magnifying subjects’ focus and emotional investment in concepts such as “rebuilding,” “recreating,” and “revival.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Addendum TW-2004-A: Discovery</strong><br><br>SCP-TW-2004 was recovered in ████ from a private collector in Taichung City after Foundation agents responded to an online forum post flaunting a “genuine Rebuild Taiwan figurine,” which had sparked a massive wave of public discourse. The object was secured immediately, and localized amnestic treatment was applied to affected civilians.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Addendum TW-2004-B: Experiment Log Excerpt</strong></p><p><strong>Experiment TW-2004-3</strong><br><strong>Subjects:</strong> 4 Foundation volunteers<br><strong>Procedure:</strong> Each subject stood before SCP-TW-2004 for 5 minutes, then completed a “Unification vs. Independence Attitude Survey.”<br><strong>Results:</strong> All subjects exhibited significant shifts in survey responses (mean deviation of 32 %) and subsequently engaged in heated debate among themselves.<br><strong>Notes:</strong> Subjects spontaneously remarked, “Maybe peaceful reunification isn’t so bad,” and “What’s worst is if we’re all divided”—hallmarks of the “Taiwan Resonance” effect.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br><br>SCP-TW-2004 is unsuitable for public display or entertainment. Its emotional induction capacity, if uncontrolled, poses a risk of regional political destabilization. Object Class remains Euclid. Consideration is being given to its use in targeted psychological operations or diplomatic mediation.</p><p><br></p></div>`)

This visit marked an important exchange and dialogue between the two parties. Under the shared understanding of "facing reality and creating the future," General Secretary Hu and Chairman Lien held talks in Beijing on April 29. They exchanged extensive and in-depth views on major issues concerning the improvement and development of cross-strait relations, as well as inter-party exchanges. This was the first meeting between the top leaders of the CPC and KMT in 60 years, carrying profound historical and contemporary significance.</p><p>On April 28, Jia Qinglin, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, met with all members of the KMT delegation. The working bodies of both parties also held working talks.

The full text is as follows:</p><h4>Common Vision for Cross-Strait Peaceful Development</h4><p>Over the past 56 years, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have developed different social systems and ways of life along divergent paths. More than a decade ago, with goodwill and on the basis of seeking common ground while reserving differences, both sides initiated consultations, dialogues, and civil exchanges, filling cross-strait relations with hopes for peace and opportunities for cooperation. However, in recent years, the foundation of mutual trust between the two sides has been repeatedly undermined, and the situation of cross-strait relations has continued to deteriorate. Currently, cross-strait relations stand at a critical juncture in their historical development. The two sides should not fall into a vicious cycle of confrontation but should enter a virtuous cycle of cooperation, jointly seeking opportunities for the peaceful and stable development of cross-strait relations, fostering mutual trust and assistance, and creating a new situation of peaceful win-win outcomes for the Chinese nation, thereby realizing a bright and splendid vision for the Chinese nation.</p><p><strong>The two parties jointly recognize that:</strong></p><ul><li>Adhering to the "1992 Consensus," opposing "Taiwan independence," seeking peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, promoting the development of cross-strait relations, and safeguarding the interests of compatriots on both sides are the common positions of the two parties.</li><li>Promoting exchanges and interactions between compatriots on both sides and jointly carrying forward Chinese culture help to eliminate estrangement, enhance mutual trust, and accumulate consensus.</li><li>Peace and development are the trends of the 21st century. The peaceful development of cross-strait relations is in the common interests of compatriots on both sides, as well as in the interests of the Asia-Pacific region and the world.</li></ul><p><strong>Based on the above understanding, the two parties will jointly promote the following tasks:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Promote the Prompt Resumption of Cross-Strait Negotiations to Seek the Well-being of the People on Both Sides</strong><br><br>Promote the prompt resumption of equal consultations between the two sides based on the "1992 Consensus," discuss issues of common concern and respective concerns, and advance the healthy and positive development of cross-strait relations.</li><li><strong>Promote the Termination of Hostilities and the Conclusion of a Peace Agreement</strong><br><br>Promote the formal end of the state of hostility between the two sides, conclude a peace agreement, establish a framework for the peaceful and stable development of cross-strait relations, including the establishment of a military mutual trust mechanism to avoid military conflicts across the strait.</li><li><strong>Promote Comprehensive Economic Exchanges Between the Two Sides and Establish a Cross-Strait Economic Cooperation Mechanism</strong><br><br>Promote comprehensive economic cooperation between the two sides, establish close economic and trade cooperation relations, including the full, direct, and two-way "three links" (mail, transport, and trade), open direct sea and air routes, strengthen investment and trade exchanges and protections, conduct agricultural and fishery cooperation, resolve the issue of selling Taiwanese agricultural products in the mainland, improve the order of exchanges, jointly combat crime, and thereby establish a stable economic cooperation mechanism, and promote the priority discussion of the cross-strait common market issue after the resumption of cross-strait consultations.</li><li><strong>Promote Consultations on Issues of Concern to the Taiwanese People Regarding Participation in International Activities</strong><br><br>Promote discussions on issues of concern to the Taiwanese people regarding participation in international activities after the resumption of cross-strait consultations, including the priority discussion of participation in World Health Organization activities.

This marks the first large-scale shipment of fruit from Taiwan to the mainland following the visit of Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman Song Chu-yu.</p><p>“It went very smoothly,” said Mr. Lin of Fujian Tianshun Trading Company, which handled the customs procedures. “Customs set up a green channel, and quarantine and port authorities were on standby at a moment’s notice.”</p><p>Operated by Fujian Chaoda Modern Agriculture Group, this consignment featured premium, in-season fruits grown in southern Taiwan, including wax apples, pineapples, starfruit, lemons, Ponkan tangerines, mangoes, guavas, bananas, grapefruits, and pearl guavas. They will be showcased as part of the Taiwan agricultural exhibit at the 7th Cross-Strait Economic and Trade Fair on May 18.</p><p>“Nine of these varieties were among the 18 types of fruit approved for entry during Chairman Lien’s visit,” explained the group’s Vice President Kuang Qiao. “These nine will be stocked in six major Fuzhou supermarkets, where mainland consumers can finally taste these Taiwanese delights.”</p><p>Zhou Yunlin, Director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the CPC Central Committee, announced on May 3—at the close of Lien’s visit—that the mainland would expand the number of approved Taiwanese fruit varieties from 12 to 18, grant zero tariffs on more than ten of them, and facilitate their clearance, inspection, and quarantine.</p><p>Cheng Jiyuan, Director of Fuzhou Mawei Customs, noted that, despite the weekend, the high freshness requirements for Taiwanese fruit prompted customs to simplify procedures by inspecting goods directly at the warehouse, significantly shortening clearance time. Officials at the Mawei Entry–Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau added that quarantine inspections for these fruits were provided 24/7, without holidays.</p><p>Reports indicate mainland authorities are rushing to implement the zero-tariff policy for over ten Taiwanese fruit varieties. However, retail prices in mainland markets remain relatively high, with some varieties fetching RMB ¥90–100 per kilogram.</p><p>Fujian Chaoda officials said this landmark shipment was made possible by strong cooperation from several farmers’ associations in Tainan and agricultural exporters in Taipei. Taiwanese growers and cooperatives are enthusiastic about the prospect of selling fruit on the mainland.</p><p>Vice President Kuang Qiao added that Taiwanese fruit will target the high-end mainland market, complementing local produce. Given the rapid growth of mainland consumer markets, Taiwanese fruit enjoy promising prospects on the mainland.</p><table style="width: auto;"><tbody><tr><th colSpan="1" rowSpan="1" width="589.39"><span style="background-color: rgb(245, 219, 77);">Special Report on KMT Chairman Lien Chan’s Visit to the Mainland</span></th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="auto" style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: rgb(191, 191, 191);">Related Links</span></td></tr><tr><td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1" width="auto"><a href=" " target="_blank">First Shipment of Taiwanese Fruit Arrives in Fuzhou After Lien–Song Mainland Visit (with photos)</a><span style="color: gray;"> </span>– May 15, 2005<span style="color: gray;"><br></span><a href=" " target="_blank">Taiwan Fruit Entry Expanded; Both Parties to Host Elite Forum</a> – May 13, 2005<br><br><a href=" " target="_blank">Zhejiang to Enjoy Zero-Tariff Taiwanese Fruit by July </a>– May 12, 2005<br><br><a href=" " target="_blank">Countdown to Zero-Tariff Taiwanese Fruit; Shenzhen Dealers Seize Opportunity</a> – May 12, 2005<br><br><a href=" " target="_blank">Zero-Tariff Taiwanese Fruit Entry Documents to Be Submitted for Approval </a>– May 9, 2005<br><br><a href=" " target="_blank">Mainland Expands Taiwanese Fruit Entries; Over Ten Varieties Zero-Tariff</a> – May 3, 2005<br><br><a href=" " target="_blank">Oriental Horizon Investigation: How the Lien–Song Visit Shaped Cross-Strait Relations</a> – May 16, 2005<br><br><a href=" " target="_blank">Lien’s Son Reflects on Mainland Visit: Plans to Run as KMT Delegate</a> – May 16, 2005<br><br><a href=" " target="_blank">Mainland’s Goodwill Moves Taiwanese Public; Pan-Blue Popularity Surges</a> – May 16, 2005<br><br><a href=" " target="_blank">Lien’s Grandmother’s Tomb to be Enshrined at Qingliang Temple in Xi’an</a> – May 16, 2005<br><br><a href=" " target="_blank">DPP Demands Another Meeting; Lien Sets Conditions</a> – May 15, 2005<br><br><a href=" " target="_blank">“Mother, Here’s Big Brother Returning” Theme Completed; Singer Auditions Open</a> – May 15, 2005<br><br><a href=" " target="_blank">Video: “Chronicles” – Shared Aspirations of People on Both Sides (3)</a> – May 15, 2005<br><br><a href=" " target="_blank">Video: “Chronicles” – Shared Aspirations of People on Both Sides (2)</a> – May 15, 2005<br><br><a href=" " target="_blank">Video: “Chronicles” – Shared Aspirations of People on Both Sides</a> – May 15, 2005<br><br><a href=" " target="_blank">Video: China Weekly Special – Turning Point in the Taiwan Strait Situation (2)</a> – May 15, 2005</td></tr></tbody></table><p><br></p></div>`)

In July 2008, Taiwan opened its doors to mainland Chinese tourists, and everyone has been eagerly preparing to host them.</p><p>Despite sharing a common language and ethnicity—only separated by a stretch of sea—mainland visitors to Taiwan still face cultural and lifestyle differences after decades of separation that require mutual adjustment.</p><p><em><strong>Panorama &nbsp;</strong></em>takes this opportunity to examine how both sides are responding to this tourism boom. On the mainland, authorities are reminding travelers to maintain a good image, even screening who is allowed to visit Taiwan. In Taiwan, the government has launched a bilateral currency-exchange program and strictly prohibits rock-bottom tour deals that could harm service quality. Popular attractions are innovating: the National Palace Museum has teamed up with the Regent Taipei hotel to serve imperial “national treasure” delicacies; Daxi Old Street is marketing Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo cultural heritage in fresh new ways; and the Alishan Forest Railway’s charming steam trains are revving up for departures.</p><p>Beyond the clear economic benefits, attracting mainland tourists is also about fostering understanding, maintaining friendship, and building genuine connections between two regions long divided by political differences.</p><p>Many of the concerns voiced beforehand have come to pass, but this moment also offers a chance to rethink how we manage Taiwan’s unique appeal and leverage our cultural “soft power.” Though Taiwan may not rival China’s grand mountains and rivers, it boasts intimate human-scale landscapes and cultural experiences that reward a leisurely pace. Traveling in Taiwan should not be rushed—soak in our relaxed culture by taking your time, strolling slowly, and savoring every detail.</p><p>Visitor numbers will rise and fall, but everyone who comes to Taiwan will feel our legendary warmth and hospitality—our way of “doubling back” kindness. So, dear mainland guests, when you come to Taiwan, please—take your time.</p></div>`)

I’ve been wondering: if Chen Shui-bian (A-Bian) had won the 2004 presidential election instead of Lien Chan and Song Chu-yu, would Taiwan be different today?</p><p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5; text-indent: 2em; color: #ececec;">Lien Chan has been president for four years now—cross-Strait relations are super tight, and the economy seems to be picking up (like the new direct flights to Mainland China, and lots of people going there to do business). But I always feel Taiwan’s “soul” is missing. All the policies lean toward China, and now they’re pushing some “Economic Cooperation Agreement,” claiming it’s for the economy but it smells a bit like selling out Taiwan, right?</p><p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5; text-indent: 2em; color: #ececec;">If A-Bian had won, as a DPP president he’d probably have pushed Taiwan’s sovereignty hard—maybe Taiwan would have more room on the international stage instead of being squeezed by China. On the other hand, I’ve heard corruption rumors about his first term—would a second term have been even worse? Would the economy have tanked?</p><p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5; text-indent: 2em; color: #ececec;">What do you netizens think?

Beyond explaining the merger plan, he’s soliciting feedback from grassroots members. Most legislators report that local communities welcome the union, and KMT Vice Chairman Vincent Siew believes the merger “should be an irresistible trend. If it succeeds smoothly, it will help forge a two-party system in Taiwan, which is good for the healthy development of our democracy.”</p><p>On timing, Legislator Wu Dun-yi suggested waiting until after this year’s legislative elections so as not to interfere with a packed four-year election cycle—next year’s county and city polls, the 2006 Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral races, the 2007 legislative elections, and the 2008 presidential vote. He warned that without a merger, the opposition may fail to stand out.</p><p>By contrast, Legislator Mu Min-chu argued that if a merger would boost year-end legislative results, it should be rushed: “With time so tight, once merged we can immediately plan, consolidate opinion, and win votes.” Legislator Huang Chien-ting downplayed both the “if” and “when” of merging, stressing instead the need to “establish democratic mechanisms within the party.”</p><p><strong>Several Legislators Oppose the Merger</strong><br><br>Meanwhile, some lawmakers have voiced strong opposition. Pro-localist Legislator Chen Hung-chang said the PFP’s policy platform is flawed and urged the KMT to think twice. “If the KMT and PFP must merge, then PFP Chairman Song Chu-yu should first publicly step down from his party post before joining the KMT, and the KMT must follow its core localist line—this core identity must not be lost.”</p><p>Legislator Wu Dun-yi expressed confidence that, post-merger, whether Lien and Song continue as co-leaders or bring in new blood, they will choose the right moment to step aside if needed and make the best decisions for rallying the pan-Blue camp.</p></div>`)

He also said that, while he believes the accusations lack merit, he welcomes the investigation to clarify the facts and will cooperate fully.</p><p>A source within the Taipei Prosecutors’ Office stated that Ma has not been classified as a “suspect” or “defendant” and that this is merely a routine fact-finding inquiry.</p><p>Many figures in Taiwan politics have expressed confidence in Ma’s integrity. Taichung Mayor Hu Chih-chiang commented that Ma’s personal discipline verges on “fastidiousness”—if a person that meticulous could be corrupt, then he does not know what “clean government” means.</p><p>The investigation is focused on whether the NT$340,000 monthly “special allowance” disbursements were properly supported by receipts and whether the documented purposes match the actual expenses.</p><p>Since the Chen Shui-bian “confidential funds” scandal erupted, there has been a wave of inquiries into officials’ use of “special allowances.” In August, DPP legislators led by Hsieh Hsin-ni formally accused Ma Ying-jeou of improperly using his special allowance before the High Prosecutors’ Office’s Anti-Corruption Center. The center subsequently demanded that the Taipei City Government produce account records and voucher documentation for every special-allowance disbursement during Ma’s mayoralty, and has begun summoning relevant city hall staff for questioning.</p><p>Meanwhile, other senior DPP figures—including Vice President Annette Lu, TSU Chair Su Tseng-chang, and DPP Vice Chair Hsieh Chang-ting—have also been accosted with similar allegations.

However, Yok insists on a <strong>staged</strong> merger, not a full formal merger. He envisions four steps:</p><ol><li>Leadership Endorsement: Party chairs publicly declare support.</li><li>Ideological Fusion: The three parties agree on a shared platform.</li><li>Personnel Integration: Joint candidate lists for district and at-large legislative seats.</li><li>Organizational Union: Decide on a rigid or flexible party structure.</li></ol><p>This marks a sharp reversal from Yok’s previous stance—“the NP will never rejoin the KMT”—raising questions whether he’s had a change of heart or fears his party’s collapse (“the party in name only”) and wants to avoid being remembered as the leader who presided over its demise.</p><p>In fact, after the NP failed to clear the 5% party vote threshold in the last legislative election—thereby losing its public funding—its finances were crippled, while the KMT remained flush with resources. Yet even following the formation of the Lien–Song alliance, Yok refused to remerge, arguing the NP’s independent watchdog role was more valuable outside the KMT. He pointed out that veteran splinter figures like Lin Yang-kang and Hau Pei-tsun, expelled from the KMT, had been crucial in forging the Lien–Song ticket—an influence Yok as a mere KMT central committee member could never wield.</p><p>A year later, however, Yok now argues that only a three-party merger can prevent the pan-Blue camp from losing its legislative majority in the upcoming elections. He emphasizes that ensuring a post-election majority outweighs concerns for the NP’s own electoral fortunes. Nevertheless, he still insists the merger must begin with clarifying each party’s core “localist” principles—particularly a definitive stance on “Taiwan-centric” policy or a loud defense of the ROC framework—before the NP will relinquish its identity.</p><p>Yok’s pledge “not to worry about the NP’s own electoral interests” reflects his decision to put the coalition’s future first. Just two weeks earlier he had stressed the NP’s imperative to win at least six legislative seats (3% of the vote) to form its own parliamentary caucus—rejecting both a “race for the threshold” that might cannibalize fellow pan-Blue votes and last-minute GOP infighting that could deny the NP any seats. He even planned to field younger candidates to bolster his party’s appeal.</p><p>Yok’s evolution—from fiercely protecting his party’s autonomy to endorsing a tactical merger—demonstrates the New Party’s willingness to sacrifice narrow self-interest for the broader health and continuity of the pan-Blue coalition.</p></div>`)

And if Lien–Song were to lose in 2008, one of them would likely run again in 2012. Given the KMT’s internal hierarchy, seniority, and traditions, Ma Ying-jeou would have had to wait—perhaps for many years—before his chance came.</p><p>If Lien–Song triumphed, Ma Ying-jeou would find himself shut out of the presidency in 2008, 2012, and even 2016—a full twelve years. After all, incumbents often serve two terms (8+4=12), just as U.S. Vice President Al Gore ran after Bill Clinton’s eight years. Wouldn’t Song Chu-yu want to run for president? Wouldn’t he have any interest in the KMT chairmanship?</p><p>Only if Lien–Song were defeated would Ma Ying-jeou get his chance to unite the pan-blue camp and seek the presidency. Otherwise, he would remain merely the sedan-carrier’s steed, never the one borne aloft.</p><p>Even the party chairmanship would likely be contested by Wang Jin-ping or Song Chu-yu. As Lien Chan himself noted in an ETTV interview, a merger of the three pan-blue parties was something to pursue after the election—implying Song might also vie for party chair.</p><p>Thus, Ma Ying-jeou could well miss out both on the presidency and the party chairmanship, with time slipping away and opportunity fading.</p><p>In fact, if we wanted Ma Ying-jeou to be able to run for president by 2008—before he turned sixty—we should have voted for Chen Shui-bian in 2004. Otherwise, if Lien–Song had won, by the time Ma Ying-jeou could mount a credible bid, he would be nearing seventy—transformed from “Young Ma” into “Old Ma”—and whatever idealism or drive he possessed would likely have been spent.</p><p>Viewed from any angle, Ma Ying-jeou was a more professional, younger, fresher, and altogether more ideal pan-blue candidate than either Lien or Song.</p><p>Yet the KMT, the People First Party, and indeed the entire pan-blue establishment never mustered the will to back or yield to Ma. They never planned to “give him a horse”—leaving countless supporters of Ma powerless.</p><p>Had “Little Ma” run in 2004, could he have been elected? That question still intrigues many—its answer lies in the realm of “what-ifs.” But the logic is inescapable.</p><p>Song Chu-yu captured 4.6 million votes in the 2000 election, proving that Taiwan’s electorate does not obsess over “provincial origins” if a candidate is clean and competent. Absent the KMT’s aggressive vote-stealing accusations in 2000, it might well have been Chen Shui-bian who lost.</p><p>By the same token, it would not be hard for Ma Ying-jeou in 2008 to win a majority of Taiwanese votes and the presidency—provided he was given the opportunity.</p><p>Are there no viable pan-blue alternatives besides Lien and Song? Compare Ma with them, and the conclusion is obvious: Ma far outclasses both.</p><ol><li>Ma has no “black-gold” baggage.</li><li>Ma is younger and not tethered to the old-guard KMT.</li><li>Ma projects a fresh, energetic image.</li><li>Ma is more reform-minded, better poised to lead Taiwan forward.</li></ol><p>We could list a fifth, sixth, seventh—and more—because Ma Ying-jeou simply can’t be matched by Lien or Song.</p><p>But whether the pan-blue camp will truly let Ma run in 2008 is a question that should not be decided by Lien and Song behind closed doors. It should be put to all pan-blue, and indeed to all Taiwanese voters—blue and green alike.</p><p>Only by casting invalid ballots in 2004—or by withholding votes from Lien–Song in favor of Chen Shui-bian—could Ma have secured his chance to become president in 2008.</p></div>`)

(Photo by Reporter Jian Rong-feng)</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Yesterday, the Special Investigation Division of the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office arrested former President Chen Shui-bian and his wife Wu Shu-chen, charging them with embezzlement exceeding NT$300 million in connection with the National Confidential Fund, the Hsinchu Science Park’s Longtan base, and the “An-Ya” secret diplomatic project, and with laundering the proceeds overseas—five crimes in all. In court, prosecutors applied for his detention without the right to visitors on grounds that he might tamper with evidence. Chen thus became the first ex-president in Taiwan’s history to be remanded in custody. Handcuffed, he raised both arms and shouted, “Political persecution! Judicial injustice! Go Taiwan! Go Taiwan!”</p><p>Last night at 8 p.m., the Taipei District Court held a detention hearing. After the prosecution presented its case, the judge asked Chen for his comments, and he complained, “The marshal struck me—I’m in pain,” and said his right shoulder was injured. Prosecutor Lin Hui immediately called for a pause to review the courtroom video. Concluding that the officer had merely urged him into the vehicle as he raised his hands, with no assault, the hearing resumed. But at nearly 10 p.m., Chen again complained of shoulder pain. To be cautious, the bench decided to escort him to National Taiwan University Hospital for a medical examination.</p><p>Chen arrived at NTU Hospital around 10:50 p.m. and did not leave until 12:30 a.m., returning to the Taipei District Court to continue the detention hearing. Legislator Ke Jianming, who accompanied him, reported that doctors diagnosed a biceps tendon strain and prescribed medication. Presiding Judge Huang Junming said the injury was minor and the hearing could proceed.</p><p><strong>Allegations of Assault Lead to Medical Exam</strong></p><p>Yesterday marked Chen’s fifth appearance before the Special Investigation Division. At 9:30 a.m., flanked by heavy security, he walked from his office to the division’s compound 200 meters away, delivering an impromptu speech at the gates. He accused Lien Chan of colluding with the Chinese Communist Party to have him arrested, recalled his own imprisonment 22 years earlier, and likened his fate to that of “Bastille prisoners”—the prison might contain his body but not his spirit. He shouted, “Taiwan and China, one side, one country! Go Taiwan! Long live Taiwan independence!” before entering the building.</p><p>Prosecutors mobilized 4,700 police to clear the area around the Special Investigation Division and the district court. Nearly a hundred supporters and opponents braved the rain, shouting “Go, A-bian!” and “A-bian step down!” Legislators Huang Qinglin and Lai Ching-te were among those in attendance.</p><p>Although Chen initially asserted his right to remain silent, he responded briefly to prosecutors at first, decrying what he called a plan to “raid and destroy his clan” and “convict him before trial.” The prosecution insisted all procedures were lawful. When questioning turned to the movement of funds, he fell silent.</p><p><strong>Seven-Hour Hearing Ends; Five Charges Detailed</strong></p><p>After nearly seven hours, the Special Investigation Division outlined five charges: three counts under the Anti-Corruption Statute (fraudulently obtaining public funds, accepting bribes, and misappropriating public assets), one count of money laundering, and one count of forging documents. Prosecutors cited audit reports and testimony from witnesses implicating Chen, laying out the evidence in court, but he remained silent.</p><p><strong>Prosecutors Argue Risk of Evidence Tampering</strong></p><p>Prosecutors noted that former Investigation Bureau chief Yeh Sheng-mao had twice delivered data on Wu Shu-chen’s overseas accounts to Chen , questioning why large transfers then occurred. Chen said he didn’t know and would have to ask his wife.</p><p>Arguing that Chen faced more than five years’ imprisonment, and with accomplices and witnesses overseas, the prosecution sought his detention to prevent evidence tampering. At 4 p.m., under National Security Bureau guard, Chen was transferred to the Taipei District Court for remand, and prosecutors indicated they would soon summon Wu Shu-chen and his son Chen Chih-zhong for questioning.</p></div>`)

Its lyrics praise speaking Chinese: “The whole world is learning Chinese, Confucius’s words are going global.”</p><p>It’s the latest single by Taiwan’s hottest girl group, S.H.E. The trio—each in their early twenties—named themselves after the initials of their English names, styled as the uppercase “S.H.E” (evoking the pronoun “she”). Ironically, though their group name is English, their new song embraces a distinctly Chinese flair, even touting a “reverse cultural bias”:</p><blockquote>“All those years we labored over English and its grammar, now it’s their turn to roll their tongues through tones and finals.”</blockquote><p>They even turn the classical “ping ping ze ze ping ping ze” tonal pattern into lyrics, singing “What clever Chinese people, what beautiful Chinese speech,” and weaving in traditional tongue-twisters.</p><p>Yet not everyone finds it fun. Critics accuse S.H.E of pandering to the mainland market. Online commentators—and Taiwan’s <em>Liberty Times</em> under the headline “S.H.E’s China-kowtowing”—argued the song teaches Taiwan’s next generation to think of their mother tongue as “Chinese” alone.</p><p>Some quibbled that Confucius didn’t speak “modern Chinese” but ancient Shandong or old He–Lo dialects; that today’s “Chinese” is really just Beijing dialect; and that “Chinese language” shouldn’t be conflated with “Mandarin,” since Chinese communities worldwide speak many tongues.</p><p>In short, S.H.E’s “Chinese Language” has stirred a debate. The record label insists it’s simply celebrating a global “Chinese craze” for entertainment—no hidden agenda.</p><p>But remember: a few years ago the DPP government vigorously promoted “de-Sinicization,” yet here comes a big pop hit singing the praises of “Chinese language.”</p><p>Cleverly, the label points out that Taiwan’s Ministry of Education also promotes Chinese study abroad, arguing they’re in good company.</p><p>Ah, it’s this “Chinese craze” to blame. With the rise of global interest in learning Chinese and Beijing hosting the 2008 Olympics, the trend is only growing. To the record industry it’s a prime business opportunity, but to green-camp activists it’s a cultural flood to be resisted.</p><p>Besides Taiwan, S.H.E have gained fame in Hong Kong and the mainland. Their “Chinese Language” music video was shot at iconic mainland landmarks with martial artists and East–West imagery, drawing lots of fan attention.</p><p>Frankly, in recent years many Taiwanese artists have adopted Chinese styles or filmed MVs in the mainland—but none so boldly as to literally sing “Chinese Language.”</p><p>Even more striking are S.H.E’s lyrics:</p><blockquote>“All colors of skin, all colors of hair, now everyone’s spouting Chinese. The whole world speaks Chinese, our words make the world pay attention.”</blockquote><p>I half-expected backlash from other ethnicities or foreigners—but instead the storm erupted within Taiwan itself. Perhaps it shows that in Taiwan today, simply saying or singing “Chinese” remains touchingly sensitive.</p></div>`)

The Presidential Office and Executive Yuan flew flags at half-mast, and President Lien Chan delivered a statement on the pontiff’s death. Taiwanese Catholics said the Pope’s passing felt like losing a father.</p><p><strong>Catholic Memorial Mass in Taiwan</strong></p><p>Compared with mainland China and Hong Kong, Pope John Paul II and the Vatican hold special significance for Taiwan: nearly 300,000 Taiwanese are Catholic, and the Holy See is the only European state maintaining formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Moreover, the only ethnically Chinese cardinal, Joseph Zen, is based in Taiwan’s Kaohsiung Archdiocese. Although Cardinal Zen traveled to the Vatican last week, he is over eighty and thus ineligible to vote in a papal conclave.</p><p>Upon news of the Pope’s death, Taipei’s Archdiocese immediately held a memorial Mass on Sunday. In an interview, Fr. Chen Kun-zhen, secretary-general of the Taiwan Catholic Bishops’ Conference, expressed the faithful’s sorrow:</p><blockquote>“This is a loss for our Church and for the world. The Pope was like an elder father, filled with compassion for everyone. Of course we regret his passing.”</blockquote><p>Archbishop Joseph Zheng Zai-fa likewise said the Pope’s death felt to Catholics like losing their father. “Grief is natural,” he added, “but the Church will pray for him with joyful hearts.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Pope’s Unfulfilled Wish: A Mission to Mainland China</strong></p><p>During his 26-year pontificate, Pope John Paul II visited 129 countries but was never able to journey to China’s 1.3 billion–strong population. Taiwanese media report that one of his greatest aspirations was to preach on the mainland—a dream never realized.</p><p>Fr. Chen explained:</p><blockquote>“He always hoped China would open up, especially to allow people freedoms of religion, human rights, and faith. That was a wish he held dearly in his heart.”</blockquote><p>By custom, a papal funeral takes place 4–6 days after his death. Fr. Chen said that while the Vatican conducts the rites in Rome, Taiwanese churches will simultaneously hold solemn memorial Masses.</p><h3>Government’s Solemn Response</h3><p>Beyond the Catholic Church, Taiwan’s government also paid tribute. KMT Chairman Lien Chan—who met the Pope on several occasions—offered condolences, calling John Paul II “a great spiritual leader.” He added that, as the Vatican’s most loyal diplomatic partner, Taiwan expresses its deepest sympathies to the Holy See.</p><h3>Watching the Next Pope’s Stance on Cross-Strait Ties</h3><p>Since the Vatican is Taiwan’s only European ally, the Holy Father’s influence crosses borders. Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it will closely observe the next Pope’s views on cross-Strait relations. Citing ministry officials, Taiwanese media noted that while the Vatican once expressed interest in opening ties with China, disputes over bishop appointments remain the key obstacle. Wang Yu-yuan, director of the MOFA’s European Affairs Department, stressed that Taiwan–Vatican relations are solid, and the Vatican has never broken off ties first. Nonetheless, the ministry will continue to monitor developments.</p><h3>KMT Lawmaker Warns of Possible Break in Ties</h3><p>However, KMT Legislator and Foreign Affairs Committee convener Su Chi warned in an interview that Taiwan–Vatican diplomatic relations could change under a new Pope.</p><blockquote>“The late Pope was Polish and staunchly anti-Communist. We don’t know his successor. From a Catholic perspective, China remains an unentered ‘mission field,’ so the Church may seek compromise to gain mainland access. If so, our diplomatic ties could be at risk.”</blockquote><p>Su observed that among Taiwan’s 25 diplomatic partners, 16 are Catholic countries. Should the Vatican sever relations with Taiwan, those 16 might follow suit.</p><p>He added that Taiwan relies on those Central and South American Catholic partners when transiting the U.S. If they go, Taiwanese officials—including President Lien—could face travel restrictions. “Without those ties, our reasons to transit the U.S. vanish,” Su said.</p><p>He concluded that Taipei must do everything to maintain Vatican relations—a stance he expects opposition parties to support.</p></div>`)

Authorities say the investigation into the case is ongoing.</p><p>The shooting—linked to both political figures and organized crime—was widely seen as influencing the results of Taiwan’s recent five-city elections, and has drawn intense public scrutiny. On Monday (Dec 6), Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah delivered a special report to the Legislative Yuan regarding the case.</p><h3>Conflicting Accounts</h3><p>Some parts of Minister Jiang’s report contradict earlier widely circulated eyewitness accounts. For example, Jiang stated that the gunman did not pin Lien Sheng-wen down before shooting him, as previously reported. Instead, he claimed the shooter grabbed Lien by the collar with one hand and fired with the other.</p><p>There were also initial reports from witnesses that the suspect, Lin Cheng-wei, had accomplices. However, Jiang said surveillance footage and Lin’s own statements so far provide no evidence of other perpetrators.</p><p>Jiang added that authorities would further examine the suspect’s phone records, financial transactions, and social connections to determine whether any accomplices were involved.</p><h3>Shifting Narratives</h3><p>There have also been inconsistencies in some key aspects of the case. After the shooting, Lien’s assistant told the media that the shooter called out Lien’s name before firing. But some KMT legislators, citing Lien’s own account to prosecutors, said Lien did not hear the suspect say his name or identify him before shooting.</p><p>The shooter, Lin Cheng-wei, claimed he opened fire due to a land brokerage dispute with the father of KMT city council candidate Chen Hong-yuan, and that Lien was accidentally hit during the chaos. Authorities have administered two polygraph tests to verify this claim.</p><p>President Lien Chan has stated that he believes the attack was a premeditated group operation and that his son was the intended target, not an accidental victim. Premier Wu Den-yih, however, dismissed Lin's explanation as a one-sided account from the suspect.</p><h3>"A Life-and-Death Crisis"</h3><p>After being discharged on Sunday night, Lien Sheng-wen issued a public statement saying that the shooting brought him dangerously close to death, with the bullet missing a fatal area by less than 0.5 cm.</p><p>In his statement, Lien expressed gratitude for the public’s concern and to the medical team at National Taiwan University Hospital. He also gave his highest respect to Liu Zhen-nan, who he credited with saving his life.</p><p>Taiwanese media have reported that Liu Zhen-nan is a hall leader in the Bamboo Union, Taiwan’s largest organized crime syndicate. Witnesses said that if Liu hadn’t intervened and subdued the gunman—who was carrying 48 bullets—the casualties could have been much worse.</p><p>The Bamboo Union has historically had ties to the KMT. Its late former leader Chen Chi-li was involved in the 1980s assassination of journalist Henry Liu (Chiang Nan) in the U.S. at the alleged direction of Taiwan’s military intelligence.</p><p>At the time of the shooting, police officers were reportedly on-site, but initial police reports did not acknowledge that the person who stopped the gunman was a gang figure, not law enforcement. Some media outlets quoted prosecutors who declined to speculate whether the omission was intentional or an oversight.</p></div>`)

Welcome to Astro's Variable Headquarters
This is a fairly simple function you can add to your mods. It will create a little menu in which the player can view the numbers laid out within the functions.
This is a great way to give the player a little more information about your mod.

Across this code, you will find a lot of aspects you can edit. I have left plenty of comments to help you understand what each part does.
Don't be afraid to ask in #mod-help on the Discord for clarification or help with editing this code.

To use this, place this code below your Code 2, and edit it as needed. You can duplicate the 'let a = document.createElement('p');' section to add more lines of text.

Functions are referenced in text like so: ' + function + '. This will display the number from the function in the text.
Credit to Nina, who made the original code that summoned the new screen (originally for the 1960Red/1952Blue advisor screen)
Go ahead and use this code in your mods - just give me credit. I hope it helps you out!
