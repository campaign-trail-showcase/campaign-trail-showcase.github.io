Proceed however you will, Michael. Perhaps you can stick around and be a leadership figure for the party, lord knows they’ll have a new candidate in 2028. Maybe you could try to run for some local position as a Prohibition candidate, or maybe your political career was over before it really began.

It seems your years in business taught you about resource management. Like a true businessman, you were able to produce more with less. Despite beginning your campaign with balloting in only one state and a very minimal budget, you’ve outperformed your 2020 counterpart and given your party some decent footing for its next election.

It seems you’ve got a couple options, Mike. You’ve done not just your party, but your country right too. America’s worst enemy is the drug epidemic, and while the nation may not be able to see it quite yet, you’ve gotten an enlightened few to open their eyes. It’s anyone’s guess as to their loyalty to your party, but something you said must’ve really stuck with them.
Perhaps use this momentum to get elected to office somewhere local?
<p>
You could also just be content with your achievement. This is a pretty major win for your party, who’ll no doubt nominate someone in 2028, with your input of course. 
<p>
And yet, even with this campaign, which the rest of your party considers an undeniable success, you ask yourself questions. The same ones, over and over, the ones that don’t stop nagging you..
<p>
Are you destined to be a historical footnote of your party? Will your party ever come close to making it? 
<p>
Maybe, just maybe, could the campaign have done any better? 
<p>
You put it out of mind.

But maybe..
<p>
Maybe lost isn’t the right term.
<p>
Nobody really expected you to “win” the election. But gaining a plurality of electoral votes shouldn’t be how people gauge your campaign’s success. Because you, Michael Wood, have done something extraordinary. This was extraordinary. 
<p>
What makes it so? Was it showing your party its best performance in over 50 years? Was it the fact that your single-issue drug campaign garnered more votes than anyone who voted for you would’ve predicted? Was it the vote total despite the poor budget from your party? Perhaps it was all of these things.
<p>
There is no telling what your future holds. And you couldn’t be happier.
<p>
Why?
<p>
Because you, Michael Wood, spoke to Americans about their biggest concern. One they didn’t even know about.
<p>
And they listened.
<p>
They listened to you, Mike.

<p>
There was tension in the air within the White House. The walls themselves seemed to buckle, as if they were bracing for the fallout of a decision long in the making. Mr. Woodrow Wilson, the 28th President of the United States, sat in his study, a dimly lit room cluttered with papers and half-finished thoughts. They were all that kept him company. Outside, the howling wind sang a mournful tune, a seeming prelude to the chaos Wilson was sure would unfold in the country he had fought so hard to lead. He rubbed his temple.
<p>
It was ratification day. The passage of this new amendment loomed over him, a harbinger of a future that he wanted no part of. How he wished he could have done something, anything, to quell the fervor with which the temperance movement had swept the nation. A roaring tide that had swept away the concerns of reason, moderation, and privacy, drowning them in a sea of moral righteousness. He recalled the hours pouring over the implications of that wretched Volstead Act, which sought to enforce what those.. Teetotalers had been whining about for years. He had no regrets in his veto. Of course he’d veto it, his conscience screamed at him against what he knew was a dangerous overreach of governmental power.
<p>
Wilson rose from his chair, the weight of his haunting guilt propelling him to the window. He gazed out at the horizon, a darkening sky mirroring his turmoil. The streets were alive with celebration, the clanging of pots and pans, the shouting of triumph echoing through the evening. Yet, to him, it resounded a lament–an elegy for the freedom that was being sacrificed at the altar of misguided virtue.
<p>
In that moment, Wilson felt the distance between himself and the country he loved widen, a chasm filled with uncertainty and darkness. He knew that history would not remember today as a victory for the spirit of America. No, this was a turning point. A moment when the nation chose to bind itself in chains of its own design. As the cheers rose higher, drowning out the whispers of his conscience, he turned away from the window, sorrow tightening its grip on his heart. The fight for the soul of America was far from over, but on this day, Woodrow Wilson felt as if he lost a battle that would echo through the annals of time.
