We have endured much. We have lost much. And yet, here we stand.</p><p>In the stillness of this hour, let us pause to remember the cost. Across this land, from the icy shores of Maine to the fertile valleys of California, fields lie fallow where crops once grew, factories sit silent where engines once roared, and countless homes echo only with the absence of voices we shall never hear again. The burden of our grief is vast, but we must carry it together.</p><p>Let us not dwell, however, on sorrow alone. Out of the ashes of division, we now face the daunting but noble task of building a new America—an America born not of fear but of hope, not of division but of unity.</p><p>We are no longer bound by the chains of the past. For too long, we allowed ourselves to be fractured by prejudice, by greed, by the false promises of those who sought to turn neighbor against neighbor for their own gain. That time is over. From this day forward, we are one people—not because we were forced to be, but because we have chosen to be.</p><p>The road ahead is steep. The wounds of this conflict will not heal overnight, nor should we expect them to. Justice demands that we address the pain inflicted, the wrongs committed, the truths obscured. But justice also demands mercy. Let us not be a nation that repays violence with vengeance or hatred with spite. Let us instead be a nation that rebuilds not only its cities and fields but its very spirit.</p><p>There will be those who say it cannot be done—that the divisions are too deep, that the dreams we share are too lofty. To them, I say this: we have already achieved the impossible. We have survived. Now, together, we must thrive.</p><p>Tonight, as you sit in your homes, with your families, with your memories of those we have lost, I ask you to believe—not in me, not in the government, but in each other. Believe in the neighbor who opens their door to lend a hand. Believe in the teacher who shapes the future with quiet patience. Believe in the worker who builds the foundation upon which we all stand. Believe, most of all, that the light we have rediscovered in our darkest hour will guide us forward.</p><p>And so, as the embers of this long struggle fade, let us vow never to let their memory be extinguished. From them, we draw warmth, courage, and resolve. From them, we ignite a new dawn.</p><p>Thank you, my friends, my fellow Americans. Let us begin again, together.</p><p><b>- President Daniel Hoan, 1943.</b></p>`)

During his power struggles in the early 1940s, Long has you arrested for ‘’conspiring with business to destroy this great nation’’. You unfortunately die in prison in 1955, not living to see the end of the Long regime.</p>`)

Welcome to Astro's Variable Headquarters
This is a fairly simple function you can add to your mods. It will create a little menu in which the player can view the numbers laid out within the functions.
This is a great way to give the player a little more information about your mod.

Across this code, you will find a lot of aspects you can edit. I have left plenty of comments to help you understand what each part does.
Don't be afraid to ask in #mod-help on the Discord for clarification or help with editing this code.

To use this, place this code below your Code 2, and edit it as needed. You can duplicate the 'let a = document.createElement('p');' section to add more lines of text.

Functions are referenced in text like so: ' + function + '. This will display the number from the function in the text.
Credit to Nina, who made the original code that summoned the new screen (originally for the 1960Red/1952Blue advisor screen)
Go ahead and use this code in your mods - just give me credit. I hope it helps you out!
