I am a one-person team and while I try to play through every scenario to make sure everything works OK, I can't catch everything. I also haven't read the books this period of Star Wars history is based on for nearly a decade, so let me know if there are any contradictions or anything else which should be changed. If you notice anything odd, either as a bug, a balance issue, or a point where the narrative doesn't seem to make sense, please contact me on Reddit by commenting on my post!<br><br>Currently known bugs: sometimes the 'other' Senate vote will be negative. I suspect this has something to do with the way the proportional vote is calculated but I can't figure out how to get rid of it. Also, sometimes the 'results by state' and 'overall results details' won't open in the case of certain landslides. If someone knows why these things happen, please let me know!<p><p>For more information, please see:<p><p><a href='https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_Black_Fleet_Crisis'>The Black Fleet Crisis</a> by Michael P.

She was only sixteen when she started running missions for the Alliance and only nineteen when she saw her planet destroyed by the Empire. Taking her adoptive father's seat on the Alliance Council after his death, she made herself indispensible to Chairwoman (and later New Republic Chancellor) Mothma. After Mothma's resignation in 11ABY, Organa - then serving as Minister of State - won an overwhelming vote to succeed her as Chancellor.<br><br>The first few years of her term have not gone as planned. Constant crisis and war with the Imperial Remnants have made it near-impossible for her to advance any sort of domestic agenda. Now, though, as the conflict dies down, perhaps she will have a chance to <i>govern</i>, and not just lead.</p>",
