However, with the changing tides of history, that once-laughed-at kid grew up to become the highest leader of the country. Coming from a poor family in rural Tainan, he gradually rose to become a legislator and mayor of Taipei, and ultimately was elected President of Taiwan in 2000. <p>However, Chen Shui-bian’s first term was nothing short of a political circus. He initially claimed to bring “reform,” but under the banner of the Democratic Progressive Party, he ended up creating a chaotic political and economic mess. In 2001, Taiwan’s GDP recorded negative growth for the first time since 1947, and unemployment hit a historic high. His vague “Four Noes and One Without”  policy neither calmed Beijing nor gained widespread support domestically. The factional infighting within the Democratic Progressive Party intensified, and the economic issues remained unresolved. In the Chiayi flood, the government watched as four victims were swept away, and only a few bodies were found.The position of this son of Taiwan seemed increasingly precarious.</p><p>things continued this way, by 2004, the KMT-PFP could easily kick him out of a position that never truly belonged to him. As a caretaker government, Chen Shui-bian has already become a has-been. By March 20, the Kuomintang will make a comeback, and the Democratic Progressive Party's one-term presidency will become a joke for a long time to come.</p> <h1 style='color: #1b9431;'>Unless the people vote to support him.</h1></div>",

Lien Chan, a Taiwanese born on the mainland, came from a distinguished family. His father, Lien Zhendong, had served as the Minister of the Interior, while his grandfather, Lien Heng, was the renowned author of <b>The General History of Taiwan</b>. Raised in a wealthy and scholarly family, Lien Chan was naturally set on a path of public service.Though the Kuomintang, which was mainly led by mainlanders, saw him as a native Taiwanese, to the farmers, laborers, and rural citizens of Taiwan, he was seen as a 'half mountain'- a term used to describe Taiwanese who went to the mainland during the Japanese rule and became closely tied to the Kuomintang.</p><p>To this day, as one of the longest-serving members of the Kuomintang, Lien Chan has held various important positions, including Minister of Transportation, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chairman of Taiwan Province, Premier, and, in 1996, was chosen by Lee Teng-hui to become Vice President. Yet, none of these roles were as enticing as the one known as POTROC, where the real power lay, offering the chance to leave a significant mark on Chinese history.</p><p>Perhaps it was the overwhelming popularity of Song Chu-yu, who refused to be your vice-presidential candidate, leading to that failure. Or maybe it was Lee Teng-hui, whom some would call an old madman, secretly advancing the agenda to 'abandon Lien to save Chen Shui-bian,' causing you to lose the presidency.hear that people said about you?
