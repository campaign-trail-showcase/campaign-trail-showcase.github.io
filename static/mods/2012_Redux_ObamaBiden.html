His master plan of tricking the US public into thinking he was an earnest man, that hoped everyone would succeed. He'd played them like fiddles. With his new House and Senate supermajorities, he could instate his master plan. First, he would pass a bill that knocks down every Christian church in America and use the rubble to build monuments to Allah. Next, he was going to raise taxes to 101% percent on billionaires, and use the money to buy every school and start teaching communist history. Finally, he would amend the constitution, and remove every odd-numbered amendment, making the American population bend to his every whim (probably, he hadn't thought that far yet).

It doesn’t make any sense. Look at that ugly fuck Mitt Romney, smirking on stage like he’s hot shit. Nixon didn’t sweep the country. Reagan didn’t capture every electoral vote. But this motherfucker. He leads a red tsunami that turns both chambers of Congress into Republican supermajorities. He’s not all that, OK? He’s a corporate buffoon with more gaffes than Joe Biden. 47 percent? Binders full of women? The 10 thousand dollar bet? Doesn’t mean shit. Nothing means anything. And now we’ve got to deal with this dog torturer and Big Bird killer for 4 years. Or probably 8 because the Democratic Party is so fucking stupid they’ll nominate Hillary in 2016. Great. Just fucking great. Go fuck yourself America.</p>`;
