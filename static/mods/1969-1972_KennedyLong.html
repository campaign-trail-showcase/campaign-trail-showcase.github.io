You asked your crowds what should be done about the growing disparities, unsure yourself. All you knew was that you could not look at any more images of starving, rat-bitten children. Today, your Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Daniel P. Moynihan has an answer. Instead of relying on Lyndon's dozens of welfare programs, America can reach its poor with a simple negative income tax that helps working families and tax increases that punish able-bodied lazy persons. Moynihan claims that this reduces bureaucratic waste and reward those who work. It also is likely to have broad support on the Hill.",

Republicans wanted an outsider during the primary and, after days of inconclusive balloting in Las Vegas, have settled on a man so outside the Establishment he's actually refused to attend the Republican National Convention—business magnate Howard Hughes. Represented instead by his so-called publicist, Clifford Irving, Hughes has been nominated in absentia alongside Bob Dole. The day has included speeches targeting your celebrity, your personality, and the \"cultural rot\" you represent. You struggle to keep a straight face when told about that. The idea of a ghost beating you on matters of \"personality\" or spirituality is laughable. This election season will be a cakewalk.",

Head in your hands, you think about the billions wasted and the hundreds of thousands of lives lost. Then you think of the election, your legacy, and what a damning indictment this represents of your political program. You were elected in 1968 to get America out of the war, to preserve some semblance of American honor.

                It was unbearable. The phone calls. The press reports. The unwarranted adulation. For weeks, Bobby had tried to block it all out. He had burrowed himself deep within his office, to focus on the issues and policies instead of the assassination attempt and the hollow victory that assassination attempt had brought him. He had tried to make monotony reassert itself, to make life move forward, but the world around him seemed trapped by it, transfixed. <br><br>Videos of his near-death played over and over on the nightly news. People dissected the image, analyzing each frame. It was all as he had imagined it—except he was still here.<br><br>Why was he still here? If he died, there at least would be something to commemorate. He would have sacrificed something. His presidency would have meant something. What had he done to deserve any of this?<br><br>He sat at the Resolute Desk with his head in his hands. He listened as the telephone rang once, twice, three times. There was a soft click and then his answering machine began playing.<br><br>“Mr. President, this is Gerald Ford. I was just checking in to see how you’re doing,” said the voice. “All of us here on the Hill are shaken, but we hope you are doing right by yourself. Take care and, uh, happy birthday.”<br><br>There was a click of the receiver. Then, again the ringing. Another voice.<br><br>“Mr. President, it’s Hale Boggs. Country’s gone to hell in a handbasket, hasn’t it? But at least you got a solid victory out of it. Something for people to remember for your birthday.” A pause. “Anyways, let me know if your people want me to help out at all next term. I think there’s a real appetite for bipartisanship.”<br><br>The phone clanged a third time. The president rose to his feet and stared at the machine.<br><br>“Mr. President, this is Earl Warren. Your brother’s death was an event that touched the heart of our nation. I, uh, hope that this event can be the vehicle to—.”<br><br>He did not hear the rest of the message. The president had grabbed the answering machine in both hands. He raised it above his head, tearing chords and snapping wires, and threw it hard across the room. There was an unpleasant noise as it embedded itself into the wall near Jack’s portrait and then hit the floor. A spiderweb of cracks remained where it had impacted.<br><br>It was pointless. It was all so pointless. All these fights. All this misery. He had wasted two years in this office twiddling his thumbs and now, suddenly, they wanted to hold hands and sing songs. His popularity has skyrocketed, not because of anything he had done, no. He hadn’t saved anyone. His support had skyrocketed because of what had happened to him, what he represented.<br><br>What was it all for? He stared up at the enormous portrait of his brother, silently pleading for some answer. What was he supposed to do?<br><br>There was no answer. He turned away. He folded his arms over his head and crumpled. Was this how Lyndon felt? Had he been consumed by the same knowledge that none of his victories would ever be his own, that he would always exist in the shadow of what had happened?<br><br>He could still remember getting the call from his brother Ted, two days after his birthday. He had been staring at the mass of cheery birthday cards in his garbage bin as his brother wept through the phone, “I’m so sorry. Robert, I’m so sorry. In Dallas. They say in Dallas he was—. Oh Robert. Bobby. Oh, Bobby. I’m sorry he’s—.”<br><br>“Surprise!” <br><br>He was aware of a change in the barometric pressure, but he did not move. His office was no longer his office. He was no longer alone. Eyes were on him. His movements were being studied. He was aware of all of this.<br><br>He unfolded himself and stared at his surroundings. A plywood desk in place of the Resolute Desk. A worn roller chair where his high-backed seat should be. A papery American flag and a printed portrait of his brother, eyes cast downward. It was cheap. Tacky. <br><br>Assembled before these set pieces were a handful of figures. Ethel. Moynihan. Unruh. Shriver. Byrd. Connally. Long. McNamara. His wife held a cake while the others stood unnaturally before him. They looked like ghosts.<br><br>“Well, Mr. President, let it never be said that you don’t know how to give a country a lot of bang for their buck,” said Byrd. “The way I see it, that image is gonna motivate all kinds of bills. I’ll work with Republicans to get legislation on things you aren’t even prepared for.”<br><br>“Right now, I’m at the Naval Observatory,” said Long quietly. “I’m watching it again and again. I’ll talk to people about it my whole life, how I coulda been president. It’s a great story.”<br><br>“I can see it too!” said Shriver. “And it’s exactly the kind of thing the family needs to keep its image alive! Documentary specials. Late-night interviews. Commemorative stamps...”<br><br>“I see it as an excuse for what we do and do not do in Vietnam,” said McNamara.<br><br>“I see it as a way to make sure the wrong kinds of criminals don’t get a piece of the pie,” said Moynihan.<br><br>“What I see is a great way to squeeze money out of our donors. Right now, I’m at a fundraiser, getting people to open their wallets by sobbing about what happened in Dallas. God bless America,” said Connally. <br><br>The president stood up shakily. “And what about them?” He said, pointing a finger past them, toward the teeming figures watching them out there in the dark. “What do they see?”<br><br>“A symbol. An icon. A brand. A representation of something that never was,” said Moynihan. “An empty vessel, endlessly repurposed.”<br><br>The president said nothing. He stared at the crowd, at the audience that stretched endlessly outward. It no longer mattered what he said. None of it would be remembered or respected. He was a puppet, a play-thing for children. His body would be used by forces larger than himself for things he neither cared about or understood. He had finally become exactly what his brother was. A story.<br><br>“Bobby,” his wife cleared his throat. She lifted the cake in a playful gesture, though her expression was one of defeat.  “It’s time to blow out your candles.”<br><br>“Try not to blow it this time,” said Long.<br><br>“Close your eyes.”<br><br>“Hope for something better.”<br><br>“Try to make it a good one.”<br><br>There was wetness on his cheeks. He wiped it away and then, seeing no other option, he blew.</p></div>`)

                Robert Kennedy’s world had burst open like a blister. Inside was nothing but blood, pus, and exposed gore. It oozed from every television station—fixated on footage of his near-death—and from the newspapers—which talked salaciously about the unprecedented sham that had been the Howard Hughes campaign. It was all a joke to them. A silly, stupid joke. His suffering, his pain, it had all meant nothing. Everything he worked for—all for nothing.  <br><br>This was not a nation that cared about Vietnam or the economy or even the state of its cities. This was a nation of children, hopped-up on cheap, dollar-store messiahs and stories of a past that never existed. They huffed hagiography from paper bags and let themselves imagine dark visions of violence, of death, of martyrdom, of Christians burned alive within golden bulls. All they cared about were leaders who looked good and delivered quips and got laid and were doomed by fate.<br><br>Which is of course why they had elected him. A failure. A man who had never delivered anything, who spent four years doing nothing but pose Christ-like beneath pictures of Jesus, who couldn’t even beat a real Republican candidate. <br><br>All he could see in his mind was Dallas. The man with the gun, approaching him in the crowd.<br><br>All he could see was Jack’s motorcade floating down Dealey Plaza.<br><br>The gun. The gun. The gun. He could see the gun. He could see the gun pointed at him and Jack and they were all the same. They were nothing. They were nothing except the Assassination. They would never be anything except the violence that stalked them. Their only legacy was the ruin and death they left in their wake. That is the only thing people saw in them. That was their only appeal.<br><br>He couldn’t bear it anymore. He couldn’t bear their poisonous, honeyed words. Not now. Not on his birthday.<br><br>His answering machine lay broken on the floor of the Oval Office. Long reams of tape bunched over the presidential seal. Chips and fragments of gears lay around it, alongside toppled pieces of furniture and shredded birthday cards. The fragments of happy, dull-eyed faces stared up at him as he poured himself a drink with a shaking hand. He brought the dark beverage to his lips, half-spilling it over his stained shirt. He had never been a drinker, but now… <br><br>He didn’t know what he was. All he knew was that he couldn’t escape. He would never escape. The glass dropped from his hands. He went to his knees to find it and, when he looked up, he was face to face with his brother’s portrait. Arms crossed. Eyes cast downward.<br><br>“Jack…” He whispered. “Please…”<br><br>The portrait said nothing. He shuffled forward, ignoring the pain as shattered glass and ruined equipment jabbed themselves into his knees.<br><br>“What was it all for?” He felt stupid. Childish. Great tears welled in his eyes. “Please tell me. Tell me what it was—.”<br><br>A spotlight turned on overhead.<br><br>“Oh, Bobby,” came a long, dark voice from somewhere behind him. Byrd’s voice.<br><br>He did not turn. He did not dare. He was aware that the carpet of his office had vanished and he was now kneeling on the hard, wood floor of a stage. The toppled pieces of furniture had become abstractions of themselves, shadows of the real objects. Props. Ghosts leered at him from across some great void.<br><br>He felt afraid.<br><br>“That’s no way to treat yourself. You’re an icon. A symbol,” a second voice had appeared from the void. It sounded like Connally, but it was not. It creeped toward him. “No one wants to worship a symbol that weeps girlishly on the floor. They want something more masculine. Reserved.”<br><br>“Think of Jack. Think of all the wonderful buildings named after him. That’s a legacy, isn’t it?” Another imposter cooed. It sounded like Moynihan but wrong. “You’ll be used forever.”<br><br>“An empire of images in your honor. Movies. Documentaries. Stage shows. Morbid obsessions. Dramatic recreations. Not every patriotic American boy gets to say the same. All they get is an flag and some shiny medals that get buried with them.” McNamara. Hot breath on his ear. Bobby shuddered. He closed his eyes and felt tears. “We know that better than most, don’t we?”<br><br>Something new shuffled across the stage. Its breathing was ragged. Joints cracked and popped. It spoke in a wispy voice that Bobby had only ever heard over the phone.<br><br>“I am watching a story. It is a story that will never leave us. Its power emerges from how simple it is. How it leaves out all the commitments and complications.”<br><br>The husk had reached him. Hands traced along his back, upward toward his neck.<br><br>“It is a story of a man who left no policies and created no institutions. It is a story of a man whose sole legacy is his image. It is an image that will allow his successors to limit civil liberties. It is an image that will be manipulated to deprive children of vaccines and send the poor to the gutter. It is an image that will be used to motivate men to kill and die for a country that cannot even be bothered to remember the names of the people they are at war with. It is an image that will be used repeatedly in all types of ways.”<br><br>Something slid across the floor. He opened his eyes to see, with horror, a cake lit with candles. Heat radiated from it, burning him. This would be his life forever.<br><br>“Happy birthday, Bobby.”<br><br>Bobby Kennedy opened his mouth. Then he began to scream.</p></div>`)

                Robert F. Kennedy was past feeling. Calls came and went to his office. He stumbled through the post-election ceremonies. He was aware of the cameras trained closely on his face and the people shouting his name. Mostly, though, he felt numb. After all his time in Office, after all his waiting and yearning, he had not expected this as an outcome. Not seriously, at least. And yet…<br><br>Briefings piled on his desk about Vietnam, about the economy, about the unrest in cities. Weeks passed. None of his aides said anything, but it was clear he had yet to touch any of them. Nothing felt real. Nothing made sense. Even as he rolled into November 20th—his birthday—it all seemed impossible.<br><br>He stood at the window, a glass of bourbon in his hand. On his desk sat his answering machine. After a swell of well-wishers, a message played that he had not expected. A message from his predecessor, Lyndon Johnson.<br><br>“Bobby…” The old man’s voice was hoarse and ragged. In his mind’s eye, Bobby could see the old man in the living room of his ranch—his hair grown long, his shirt untucked, fat. “I wanted to call you. I should have called sooner, but…” There was a series of phlegm-filled coughs. “Oh goddamnit, I’ve never been good at these fucking things. It just seemed like now would be a good time, what with the Election.”<br><br>Bobby continued to stare at the window. His expression was unreadable.<br><br>“I’m not sure why things ended up with us like they did. Maybe it was McCarthy.” Kennedy imagined his fallen, one-time hero—Joseph McCarthy. “Maybe it was the hunting trip.” He saw himself sprawled flat on his back from the recoil of a gun as Lyndon laughed above him. “I don’t know. I wish I knew why you hated me. Hell, I wish I knew why I hated you. Seems like a damn silly thing now.”<br><br>In the reflection of the window, he could make out the faint shape of his brother’s portrait. Suddenly, the sight of it was unbearable. He stared down into the dark brown liquid of his drink.<br><br>“I want you to know that I don’t blame you for what happened. Lord knows I tried to do my best but—.” More coughing, this time even more ragged. “There’s no reason we gotta be at each other’s throats. Not anymore, at least.”<br><br>Bobby swished the liquid in his glass, feeling something hard form in his throat.<br><br>“I’d like to hear from you sometime. No press. No recorders. No fucking cameras. I’d just like to…” A sigh. “Move on. Have us talk like men.”<br><br>There was an achingly long pause.<br><br>“I’ll understand if you don’t respond, but your people know where to reach me.” <br><br>There was the sound of movement. Bobby imagined Johnson leaning back into his easy chair, staring out a window at the same sky from miles away. <br><br>“So long, Bobby. Happy birthday. Send Ethel my love.”<br><br>There was a clang of a phone being set on its receiver, followed by a whirring. When the device reached the end of the tape, there was a click followed by silence. He closed his eyes.<br><br>“You mean all this time we coulda been friends,” said a loud voice in a high-pitched, mocking whine. “What a joke.”<br><br>The noise shocked him into action. Robert swung around, nearly spilling his drink, and gasped. His office was no longer his office. It looked like a cheap imitation of it. A chipped, wooden desk in place of his own. A paper American flag that hung loosely on a pole. A printed picture of his brother. Then, in place of the back wall of the Oval Office, a yawning void. Across the gap, he could see a thousand dark figures, watching him closely. <br><br>“You’d think a man like Lyndon would know better. I mean, really… It’s sad.”<br><br>Bobby turned his gaze away from the spectral figures in the darkness to the far side of the stage. Entering from the left was the squat figure of Robert Byrd. He looked strange, surreal. Stage make-up was plastered over his face and, in his right hand, he balanced a single cake. The words, “Happy Birthday, Bobby!” were written in frosting across it. <br><br>Bobby opened and shut his mouth uselessly. It seemed like an eternity before his voice returned to him.<br><br>“I don’t think it’s pathetic at all…”<br><br>Byrd clicked his tongue. He sauntered across the stage and set the cake on his desk. Its candles blazed. “Don’t be stupid, Bobby. It’s too late for any of that.”<br><br>“But it’s not. He just said—.”<br><br>“The two of you are moving in two completely different directions. He’s Joan Crawford, dying on the beach and you… you…” He threw his hands up. A smile spread across his face. “Oh, Bobby. Oh my dear Bobby. They’re never gonna forget you now. Not ever. You belong to the ages.” <br><br>Bobby balled his fists and walked around the desk to face the intruder. He had a half an inch on Byrd and he tried to make that difference notable. “The hell do you mean? I didn’t do any of this to be some… some… marionette. A play-thing for you or the historians or anyone—.” <br><br>“You really believe that?” Byrd shouted. He pressed a fat finger into Robert’s chest. “You coulda passed bills. You coulda fought for your people. You coulda tried to do everything you promised in ‘68. You <i>chose</i> not to. You <i>chose</i> to create this impossible, absurd outcome. The only way you coulda done it is if you aimed for it.”<br><br>Bobby said nothing. He jutted out his jaw. A sly grin returned to Byrd’s face.<br><br>“You gave up the impossible dream cause you wanted to be remembered,” Byrd said. “Just like your brother.”<br><br>Bobby stared at him. The two of them locked eyes. Bobby tightened his fists. Then, when the pressure had become unbearable, he looked away. Byrd clapped with delight and rounded behind the president. Bobby felt a strong hand on his back.<br><br>“Now don’t be too sour, my dear Bobby. It’s not all bad. They’ll use you forever. Your face. Your name. It will be inescapable. The first and last word in politics. It’ll be Bobby Kennedy. Bobby Kennedy forever.”<br><br>Byrd led him toward his desk where the cake still sat. The candles had burned halfway down their wax. They were mesmerizing in the darkness.<br><br>“I should know. I’m gonna be an institution myself. Hell, I already am in West Virginia. They use my name for all kinds of shit.” The two were stationed in front of the cake now. A hard hand pushed him downward. “The two of us are the only people alive who understand the need for a show. And people are gonna love it.”<br><br>Bobby stared at the flames and the wax as it dripped downward.<br><br>“So go on, make a wish, Bobby. This is what you wanted, so make a wish that it all works out in the end, that they’ll use you for something good.”<br><br>Bobby breathed in.<br><br>“And, good God, try not to blow it.”<br><br>He blew out the candles. The stage lights went dark. They returned to the abyss.</p></div>`)

                Consummation</h3><p><span style=\"color:#d6ced6;\">
                The White House was strangely quiet in the days after Bobby Kennedy’s victory over “Howard Hughes”. There were the usual statements to the press. Congratulatory letters arrived from abroad. His allies toasted to his success with speeches prepared weeks prior, speeches that made no acknowledgment of the calamitous end to the Election. Bobby Kennedy sat through all of these. He forced himself not to squirm. He tried to accept these kind words at face value. He spent long nights listening to the messages left on his Office phone. <br><br>It’s where he found himself weeks after the catastrophe, on November 20th, his birthday.<br><br>“Hello, Mr. President. Gerald Ford. I wanted to call on the occasion of your birthday to wish my best to you and your wife. I understand that it’s been some time since our last conversation, back when I was still in the House, but with the state my party is in—.””<br><br>He thumbed the skip button on his recorder before agitation could overwhelm him. Tape whirred in the machine.<br><br>“Mr. President. It’s Bob Dole. I was wondering if you had received my letter about pardons for uh… this Irving business. It’s clear that all of us got put in a bad spot, but it’s Irving and Morton’s fault as opposed to the whole lot. It would be magnanimous if—.”<br><br>He president let out an involuntary snarl. He jammed the machine harder. The tape rattled in the machine. There was the squeaking of gears before the next message played.<br><br>“Robert, this is, uh, Dick Nixon. Listen, this whole Hughes business is a terrible thing. For everyone. I am sure I’m the last person you want to hear from, but I wanted to talk to you about ways we could all come together. As a country.” There was a long pause on the machine. “Oh and, uh, Pat says happy birth—.”<br><br>He hit the machine so hard that something snapped within the machine. Gears grinded against one another. Black ribbon poured outward and an acrid smell filled his office. Robert walked around his desk and with a yank pulled the cord free from the wall. The grinding ceased and the room lapsed into silence. <br><br>He stood there, head down, chord in his hand. He felt on the verge of frenzy.<br><br>For two years, he had tried to prove himself. He had done everything right after the calamity of the midterms, had tried his hardest to salvage the Democratic Party from disrepute. Instead of an opponent, the Republican Party had sent him a scammer wearing the mask of a dying man. They had sent him Clifford Irving, who had offered no full-throated defense of conservatism but a collection of cheap tricks and gimmicks. Celebrity. Tabloid gossip. <br><br>This was supposed to be an Election to prove himself and show he could save the nation’s soul. Instead, he had gotten lucky opposing a huckster. He had become the victor of the lowest turnout election in American history. <br><br>He felt scammed as everyone else.<br><br>He dropped the cord and walked across the room to the painting of his brother Jack. Head down, arms crossed. For much of his presidency, he had looked at this portrait as a source of solace. Now, all he could focus on were the individual brush strokes. It too was not the real thing. Only an imitation. It had nothing of his brother’s real dimension. It knew nothing of his tragedies, of how he had spent the last few hours of his life.<br><br>He could still remember getting the call from his brother Ted, almost nine years ago. He had been staring at the mass of cheery birthday cards in his garbage bin as his brother wept through the phone, “I’m so sorry. Robert, I’m so sorry. In Dallas. They say in Dallas he was—. Oh Robert. Bobby. Oh, Bobby. I’m sorry he’s—.”<br><br>He was not alone in his Office.<br><br>Though he had not moved from his spot before the painting, he was aware of something shifting behind him. A figure sitting in the chair behind his desk. There was a groan of movement.<br><br>“I was a man once too, you know,” said the creature in a low, rattling voice. “I had a name. Then they took it away from me.”<br><br>Bobby said nothing. He kept his eyes fixed firmly on the painting. It felt as though someone had turned a bright spotlight over him. Sweat poured down his back.<br><br>“They did the same to your brother. They didn’t even wait until his body was cold. They use his image in ways he couldn’t even imagine.”<br><br>He remained frozen, even as his eyes searched around frantically for help. Instead he was greeted by more strangeness. His office no longer looked real. It looked cheap. Tacky. He could see the blurry outline of a paper American flag. Instead of his wall’s back office there was a yawning blackness from which a thousand watching people could be seen.<br><br>“They’ll do the same to you too.” <br><br>He could hear the figure rising. Its bones cracked and shifted. He wondered if he should run or scream but his voice had left him. He could only do one thing. The fake American flag fluttered at the edge of his sight.<br><br>“It’ll be sooner than you think. They’ll use you up until there’s nothing left. Then you’ll be another image on a wall, just like—.”<br><br>He grabbed the pole holding the flag and turned, yelling. He was aware of the crowd beyond his reach leaning forward. He raised the flag over his head, ready to strike and—.<br><br>There was no one there. A single small cake sat on his desk. Candles blazed. Forty-seven candles for forty-seven years. Written in icing on the top was a single phrase, “Happy birthday, Bobby.”<br><br>He took a nervous step toward his desk. The stage on which he was standing seemed deathly quiet. He set the flag pole down against the edge of the prop desk.<br><br><i>Make a wish</i>, said a voice in his head, make it a good one.<br><br><i>Try not to blow it</i>, said another.<br><br>His head swam. He leaned forward. He looked strange and sickly illuminated beneath the candle light.<br><br><i>Hope for something better.</i><br><br>Bobby stared into the candles. Then, before he could stop himself, he blew.</p></div>`)

                Accomplishment</h3><p><span style=\"color:#d6ced6;\">
                Election Day came and went. It was followed by the usual pomp—celebratory newspaper headlines, congratulatory letters, phone calls from well-wishers. He did not, as he was so prone to do, retreat into himself. Instead, he tried to force himself to be courteous and engaged, to understand his supporters’ concerns, to treat them with real gratitude.  <br><br>After all, his election had been far from assured. Over the last two years, he had bucked convention. He had taken the hard road. He had focused on delivering change—real change—at a time when it would have been easy to keep his head down and avoid hard, alienating decisions. Instead of abandoning his supporters for greater appeal, he had remained firmly committed to realizing the vision he promised in 1968. <br><br>Nothing was definitively solved—-briefings to continue to pour in about Vietnam, the sluggish economy, and unrest—-but he felt like he had a direction now. He was moving the country forward, and there was nothing his enemies could do but call to complain. <br><br>“Robert,” came a Southern growl through the answering machine on his desk. <br><br>It was November 20th, several weeks after the Election. He found himself seated in the Oval Office, trying to finish some paperwork before a birthday party in his honor, one that his wife had practically forced on him. He stopped thumbing through his inbox to listen.<br><br>“This is Robert Byrd. I don’t know what your people are telling you right now. I’m sure they’re spinning you some fanciful yarn about what to expect in the next four years, but if you think you can ignore the interests of your party and the South—.”<br><br>He pressed the button on his machine to skip the message. On his desk beside his inbox was a party hat, a gift left behind from one of his children.<br><br>“Mr. President,” the voice this time was thin, with a slight German accent. “It’s Henry Kissinger. I know you are used to getting your way, but I want to warn you to tread lightly. Vietnam is one thing, but this country will not tolerate the same unrestrained deference toward China and the Soviet Union. It is irresponsible statecraft to—.”<br><br>He pressed the skip button again. The machine whirred. He picked up the hat and played with it in his fingers.<br><br>“Bobby. It’s Moynihan. I want to be a team player, but I simply can’t stay silent any longer. What you’ve done with the Family Assistance Plan, it’s unconscionable. This thing cannot endure long-term as it stands. It’s rewarding laziness. You’ve completely corrupted—.”<br><br>He pressed STOP on the machine. The room lapsed back into silence. He stared at the small paper hat in his hands. He twisted it between his fingers, marveling at the striped pattern that snaked around it. What a strange thing, he thought. How strange to imagine that he was here, at the age of 47. <br><br>For so long, he had imagined himself being struck down before reaching this summit. He had darkly imagined his demise by a hail of bullets, by an ungrateful nation, by his own bigotries or cowardice. It would have been the perfect ending to his life, a dramatic final flourish, something to give meaning to all the pain and suffering he’d endured. And yet…<br><br>He set the hat down and stood up, turning to stare at the portrait of his brother on the wall. Its arms crossed, head cast downward in an expression of eternal sorrow. He had stared at this portrait so many times throughout his presidency. He had wondered if Jack would be proud of what he’d done and if he’d appreciate the sacrifices he had made in his name. <br><br>Now, however, he realized those were the wrong questions. <br><br>His vision began to shimmer. He wiped tears from his eyes and as he did, he realized that the portrait before him was no longer how he remembered it. Instead of oils, it had transformed into something printed. His desk had transformed into something of cardboard. His phone had become useless plastic. Less objects than a recreation of them. A memory. A haunting.<br><br>“Don’t stop now, Bobby,” came a voice from behind.<br><br>He turned. Situated before him was a small crowd of people. Ethel. Unruh. Shriver. Long. Loved ones. Friends and family. He stared at them, at the birthday cake in his wife’s outstretched hands, and then at what lay beyond them, stirring in the darkness.<br><br>“I loved him so much,” Robert said. <br><br>Shriver cast his eyes downward. “We know.”<br><br>“He was the world.”<br><br>“He was the world to all of us,” said Unruh, his eyes hidden behind his glasses.<br><br>“But he’s gone now and he’s never coming back,” his vision blurred again. “None of us ever get to come back again. Not as we were.”<br><br>“We become symbols. Abstractions,” said Long. “Our memory get abused by people who don’t understand who we were or what we stood for. Our flailings get reinvented as moments of great moral weight.”<br><br>“It was never about legacy,” the president muttered. “It was about living for the people who are alive now.”<br><br>“It’s about letting them in,” said Long.<br><br>“Opening the door,” said Shriver. <br><br>“Moving forward,” said Unruh.<br><br>“It’s about growing up,” said the president. He wiped his eyes against the back of shirt and gave a soft chuckle. “Damn, all of this, just to learn a lesson straight out of a fairy tale.”<br><br>He looked upward, aware of the crowd in the darkness but no longer caring. They could watch all they wanted, but what they saw wasn’t half as important as what he did. They had no claim over his soul.<br><br>“Alright,” he said at long last. “Should we get this party over with?”<br><br>His wife took a step toward him. She smiled and raised the cake upward. “Come on, Bobby. Blow out the candles and make a wish.”<br><br>“Don’t blow it obsessing on things that never were,” said Shriver.<br><br>“Hope that people use this to build something better,” said Unruh.<br><br>“Try to make this life a good one,” said Long.<br><br>The president stared into the candles. He thought of Jack one last time. Then he took a deep breath in, held it, and blew. And with that, at last, the stage lights dimmed and the curtain closed.</p></div>`)

                After the celebrations, after the speeches, after the parades and congratulatory letters and buzzy press reports commemorating his decisive victory, Bobby found himself alone again. It had happened sooner than he’d imagined. The relief he’d felt on Election Day vanished beneath waves of briefings about the situation in Vietnam, about the struggling economy, about the unrest in cities. His victory had resolved nothing. There was no great swelling of music, no rolling of the credits. Instead, he found himself faced with another four years of intractable problems and unpleasant compromises.<br><br>He pushed his way down halls of the West Wing, grunting in response to the congratulations of well-wishers. He turned sharply at the door of the Oval Office and, before anyone else could interrupt his ruminations, he sealed himself inside. The room was dark. Quiet. On his desk blinked the single red light of his answering machine. <br><br>He stared at it, hairs creeping up along the back of his neck. Then, before he could stop himself, he jammed the button with his finger. There was the whirring of tape and, then, the sudden intrusion of voices.<br><br>“Mr. President, Senator Eastland calling,” came the grovelling voice from the machine. “My, uh, staff thought it useful to call you and, uh, send you congratulations on your victory and your birthday.” A long pause. “After seeing what you’ve done with Byrd, I feel I may have misjudged you. Have your people call my office and we can try to set something up.”<br><br>The president pursed his lips. He stiffly retrieved a bottle of whisky from a compartment behind his desk.<br><br>“Bobby, how the hellare you, you goddamn bastard,” slurred a voice through the machine. The light clinking of glass could be heard in the background. “It’s Herman Talmadge. Senator from… oh you know. Listen, I’m sure you’re out with your boys tonight, but I wanna make amends for the rough business we gave you in the Senate. You really turned things around. Showed the… crooks the business. You’re one of the good ones, Bob, don’t forget that.”<br><br>The bottle hit the desk, harder than the president intended. He gripped it tightly in his hand, unable to will himself to pour a glass. <br><br>“Robert. Robby. Bobby. Byrd told me he saw something in you but I didn’t believe it,” came the voice of Dolph Briscoe. “Maybe you Yankee boys know how to play ball after all. Listen, I got some meetings coming up with some of my buddies in Texas. I thought you and Byrd might—.”<br><br>Bobby tried to slam the messages off but his hand was still gripping the bottle. The glass collided with the machine, like a captain christening a ship. There was a crack. Then, it shattered. Liquid spread across his desk and papers, tricking down the sides of the desk. None of this stopped the voices, which continued to pour through the receiver into the room. One thousand Good Old Boys all wanting a piece of his time! One thousand Southerners all congratulating him for seeing their point of view! He was drowning in it. <br><br>He threw the leaking bottle into a garbage can then slammed the answering machine with his fist. The voices ruptured into silence. <br><br>Why was he so miserable? He stared intently at the dark pool on his desk. Why couldn’t he be happy at having won? At having won decisively. Historically. He’d worked hard, hadn’t he? He’d proven he wasn’t just a fluke, a punk kid with a shiny name. <br><br>Had Jack felt this way when he won all those years ago? Had he taken this office with all its power and prestige and realized just how little there was to it? Did he feel the same emptiness inside him? Or had his death been a relief? Had it saved him from the dirty business of having to contend with all these Southern interests and compromising on his principles? Had death saved him from the loss of his immortal soul at the hands of these horned devils?<br><br>He could still remember getting the call from his brother Ted, two days after his birthday. He had been staring at the mass of cheery birthday cards in his garbage bin as his brother wept through the phone, “I’m so sorry. Robert, I’m so sorry. In Dallas. They say in Dallas he was—. Oh Robert. Bobby. Oh, Bobby. I’m sorry he’s—.”<br><br>“Surprise!” <br><br>Lights blared to life overhead. The president felt himself involuntarily gasp. He could suddenly see through the artifice, through the cheapness of the scenery. A paper American flag. A chipped desk. A plastic red telephone. Jack’s portrait. Less objects than a recreation of them. A memory. A haunting.<br><br>And then, situated across from him, a mass of bodies. Ethel. Moynihan. Unruh. Shriver. Byrd. Connally. Long. McNamara. He stared uncomprehendingly at their smiling faces, at the cake in his wife’s outstretched arms, and then at what lay beyond them, stirring in the darkness beyond him.<br><br>“What—?”<br><br>“Oh happy birthday, Bobby!” said the crowd as one. <br><br>Bobby remained frozen beneath the spotlight. Gears moved in his head. “You’re not real, are you?”<br><br>There was a pause, like a gear sliding out of place, before the scene reasserted itself.<br><br>“Well, hell, what kind of question is that,” said Byrd. The chairman gave a fiendish chuckle. “Me? You? We’re as real as people decide we are.”<br><br>Long gave a sad, defeated smile. “ And I don’t think anyone’s gonna forget anytime soon what you and Byrd accomplished together. All those votes, you must be happy.”<br><br>“A landslide victory,” said Unruh. The words fell out of his mouth like lead. “All you had to do was empower the very people you once stood again.”<br><br>“But still you have your victory, your place in history. Not even Jack could pull that one off,” said Shriver in a dull voice.<br><br>“Well, Jack could of. He coulda had a real nice victory before the civil rights business and that damn stupid thing with King. Talk about a crisis of conscience,” said Connally. He gave Byrd a leering smile. “But you know better, don’t you, Bobby?”<br><br>“There are always sacrifices that have to be made, people to be cast aside,” said McNamara, red tie like a gash across his neck. <br><br>“For the greater good,” said Long. “Isn’t that what you always say?”<br><br>Bobby backed away from the assembled group and the teeming shapes in the darkness. “No. That’s not what happened. I… I… made compromises, but I won this to prove… I won this for…”<br><br>“Oh, yes, for the party. For the family. For Jack. We know. We understand,” said Connally with exaggerated deference. “What a wonderful little story to tell. It’s just the kind of thing people will remember. We are nothing without our stories, aren’t we?”<br><br>“God, imagine the stories they’ll tell about me?” Said Byrd, half to Bobby and half to the crowd. “I imagine I’ll be able to sit nice and pretty with that one for a good long while. Just gotta wait for that egg to hatch.”<br><br>There was a cackle somewhere  in the dark beyond the scene. Bobby’s head turned toward the noise, toward the rows of bodies beyond his reach, rows that seemed to stretch infinitely outward.<br><br>“No. I didn’t do this just to be remembered as a personality,” he wasn’t sure who he was pleading to anymore. “It was never about that. It was never about becoming president for the sake of being president. It was about opening up possibilities. It was about helping people expand their possibilities, to think about…”<br><br>“Things that never were.” It was Ethel’s voice this time. He stared at her, his wife, still holding a cake whose candles were half-melted. She had a strange, sad expression.<br><br>“Surely, people remember the policies we put in place,” Bobby whispered.<br><br>“Robert,” his wife said. She took a step closer.<br><br>“They remember the institutions we built.”<br><br>“Robby,” she said, closer now. Her voice was barely more than a whisper.<br><br>“The people we helped.”<br><br>“Bobby.” <br><br>She was right on top of him now. Her face looked eerie beneath the lit candles.<br><br>“What was it all for? Was all this pain just to be… preserved as just another face on a wall? To be made like…?” He gestured uselessly to the false portrait of Jack.<br><br>“Come on, Bobby. Blow out the candles and make a wish,” said his wife.<br><br>“Try not to blow it this time,” said Long.<br><br>“Close your eyes.”<br><br>“Hope for something better.”<br><br>“Try to make it a good one.”<br><br>There was nowhere else to go. Nothing else to do. He gave one last look across the stage and then to the crowd judging him from beyond. Then, he shut his eyes, took a deep breath, and blew.</p></div>`)

Let us know if you ever want to come on the show. We’d all be very interested in hearing what you’re up to.”<br><br>The president’s face remained stony. He stiffly retrieved a bottle of whisky from a compartment behind his desk.<br><br>“Robbo, it’s Armand Hammer! Occidental Petroleum! I called your secretary to see if you had any plans for your birthday tonight, but she says you’re busy. Well, I guess I’ll have to find some other time to suck up to the Commander-in-Chief.” He let off a fake laugh. “Just a joke. Let me know when I can take you out. We can really help each other out, you and I.”<br><br>The bottle hit the desk with a clunk. He gripped it tightly in his hand, unable to will himself to pour a glass. <br><br>“Robert, it’s Jackie. Oh...I’m so very sorry that I won’t be able to make it, but I'm calling from Skorpios, and Aristotle and I wanted to wish—.”<br><br>Bobby tried to slam the messages off but his hand was still gripping the bottle.

That none of those compromises would even matter because in less than four years, he’d be dead?<br><br>He could still remember getting the call from his brother Ted, two days after his birthday. He had been staring at the mass of cheery birthday cards in his garbage bin as his brother wept through the phone, “I’m so sorry. Robert, I’m so sorry. In Dallas. They say in Dallas he was—. Oh Robert. Bobby. Oh, Bobby. I’m sorry he’s—.”<br><br>“Surprise!” <br><br>Lights blared to life overhead. The president felt himself involuntarily gasp. He could suddenly see through the artifice, through the cheapness of the scenery. A paper American flag. A chipped desk. A plastic red telephone. Jack’s portrait. Less objects than a recreation of them. A memory. A haunting.<br><br>And then, situated across from him, a mass of bodies. Ethel. Moynihan. Unruh. Shriver. Byrd. Connally. Long. McNamara. He stared uncomprehendingly at their smiling faces, at the cake in his wife’s outstretched arms, and then at what lay beyond them, stirring in the darkness beyond him.<br><br>“What—?”<br><br>“Oh happy birthday, Bobby!” said the crowd as one. <br><br>Bobby remained frozen beneath the spotlight. Gears moved in his head. “You’re not real, are you?”<br><br>There was a pause, like a gear sliding out of place, before the scene reasserted itself.<br><br>“What is?” said Unruh, straightening his thin black tie. “Me? You? We’re as real as people decide we are.”<br><br>“And the people have decided that you are as real as they get, Bobby dearest. A landslide victory—oh my goodness,” intoned Byrd. “It don’t get any more real than that.”<br><br>“Not even Jack could pull that one off,” said Shriver, cheerily.<br><br>“Well, he could of, before the civil rights business and did that damn stupid thing with King. Talk about a crisis of conscience,” said Connally. He gave a leering smile. “But you know better, don’t you, Bobby?”<br><br>“There are always sacrifices that have to be made, people to be cast aside,” said McNamara, red tie like a gash across his neck. <br><br>“For the greater good,” said Long. <br><br>Bobby backed away from the assembled group and the teeming shapes in the darkness. “No. That’s not what happened. I… I… made compromises, but I won this to prove… I won this for…”<br><br>“Oh, yes, for the party. For the family. For <i>Jack</i>. We know. We understand,” said Connally with exaggerated deference. “What a wonderful little story to tell. It’s just the kind of thing people will remember. We are nothing without our stories, aren’t we?”<br><br>There was a cackle somewhere  in the dark beyond the scene. Bobby’s head turned toward the noise, toward the rows of bodies beyond his reach, rows that seemed to stretch infinitely outward.<br><br>“No. I didn’t do this just to be remembered as a personality,” he wasn’t sure who he was pleading to anymore. “It was never about that. It was never about becoming president for the sake of being president. It was about opening up possibilities. It was about helping people expand their possibilities, to think about…”<br><br>“Things that never were.” It was Ethel’s voice this time. He stared at her, his wife, still holding a cake whose candles were half-melted. She had a strange, sad expression.<br><br>“Surely, people remember the policies we put in place,” Bobby whispered.<br><br>“Robert,” his wife said. She took a step closer.<br><br>“They remember the institutions we built.”<br><br>“Robby,” she said, closer now. Her voice was barely more than a whisper.<br><br>“The people we helped.”<br><br>“Bobby.” <br><br>She was right on top of him now. Her face looked eerie beneath the lit candles.<br><br>“What was it all for? Was all this pain just to be… preserved as just another face on a wall? To be made like…?” He gestured uselessly to the false portrait of Jack.<br><br>“Come on, Bobby. Blow out the candles and make a wish,” said his wife.<br><br>“Try not to blow it this time,” said Long.<br><br>“Close your eyes.”<br><br>“Hope for something better.”<br><br>“Try to make it a good one.”<br><br>There was nowhere else to go. Nothing else to do. He gave one last look across the stage and then to the crowd judging him from beyond. Then, he shut his eyes, took a deep breath, and blew.</p></div>`)

                Accomplishment</h3><p><span style=\"color:#d6ced6;\">
                Election Day came and went. It was followed by the usual pomp—celebratory newspaper headlines, congratulatory letters, phone calls from well-wishers. He did not, as he was so prone to do, retreat into himself. Instead, he tried to force himself to be courteous and engaged, to understand his supporters’ concerns, to treat them with real gratitude.  <br><br>After all, his election had been far from assured. Over the last two years, he had bucked convention. He had taken the hard road. He had focused on delivering change—real change—at a time when it would have been easy to keep his head down and avoid hard, alienating decisions. Instead of abandoning his supporters for greater appeal, he had remained firmly committed to realizing the vision he promised in 1968. <br><br>Nothing was definitively solved—-briefings to continue to pour in about Vietnam, the sluggish economy, and unrest—-but he felt like he had a direction now. He was moving the country forward, and there was nothing his enemies could do but call to complain. <br><br>“Robert,” came a Southern growl through the answering machine on his desk. <br><br>It was November 20th, several weeks after the Election. He found himself seated in the Oval Office, trying to finish some paperwork before a birthday party in his honor, one that his wife had practically forced on him. He stopped thumbing through his inbox to listen.<br><br>“This is Robert Byrd. I don’t know what your people are telling you right now. I’m sure they’re spinning you some fanciful yarn about what to expect in the next four years, but if you think you can ignore the interests of your party and the South—.”<br><br>He pressed the button on his machine to skip the message. On his desk beside his inbox was a party hat, a gift left behind from one of his children.<br><br>“Mr. President,” the voice this time was thin, with a slight German accent. “It’s Henry Kissinger. I know you are used to getting your way, but I want to warn you to tread lightly. Vietnam is one thing, but this country will not tolerate the same unrestrained deference toward China and the Soviet Union. It is irresponsible statecraft to—.”<br><br>He pressed the skip button again. The machine whirred. He picked up the hat and played with it in his fingers.<br><br>“Bobby. It’s Moynihan. I want to be a team player, but I simply can’t stay silent any longer. What you’ve done with the Family Assistance Plan, it’s unconscionable. This thing cannot endure long-term as it stands. It’s rewarding laziness. You’ve completely corrupted—.”<br><br>He pressed STOP on the machine. The room lapsed back into silence. He stared at the small paper hat in his hands. He twisted it between his fingers, marveling at the striped pattern that snaked around it. What a strange thing, he thought. How strange to imagine that he was here, at the age of 47. <br><br>For so long, he had imagined himself being struck down before reaching this summit. He had darkly imagined his demise by a hail of bullets, by an ungrateful nation, by his own bigotries or cowardice. It would have been the perfect ending to his life, a dramatic final flourish, something to give meaning to all the pain and suffering he’d endured. And yet…<br><br>He set the hat down and stood up, turning to stare at the portrait of his brother on the wall. Its arms crossed, head cast downward in an expression of eternal sorrow. He had stared at this portrait so many times throughout his presidency. He had wondered if Jack would be proud of what he’d done and if he’d appreciate the sacrifices he had made in his name. <br><br>Now, however, he realized those were the wrong questions. <br><br>His vision began to shimmer. He wiped tears from his eyes and as he did, he realized that the portrait before him was no longer how he remembered it. Instead of oils, it had transformed into something printed. His desk had transformed into something of cardboard. His phone had become useless plastic. Less objects than a recreation of them. A memory. A haunting.<br><br>“Don’t stop now, Bobby,” came a voice from behind.<br><br>He turned. Situated before him was a small crowd of people. Ethel. Unruh. Shriver. Long. Loved ones. Friends and family. He stared at them, at the birthday cake in his wife’s outstretched hands, and then at what lay beyond them, stirring in the darkness.<br><br>“I loved him so much,” Robert said. <br><br>Shriver cast his eyes downward. “We know.”<br><br>“He was the world.”<br><br>“He was the world to all of us,” said Unruh, his eyes hidden behind his glasses.<br><br>“But he’s gone now and he’s never coming back,” his vision blurred again. “None of us ever get to come back again. Not as we were.”<br><br>“We become symbols. Abstractions,” said Long. “Our memory get abused by people who don’t understand who we were or what we stood for. Our flailings get reinvented as moments of great moral weight.”<br><br>“It was never about legacy,” the president muttered. “It was about living for the people who are alive now.”<br><br>“It’s about letting them in,” said Long.<br><br>“Opening the door,” said Shriver. <br><br>“Moving forward,” said Unruh.<br><br>“It’s about growing up,” said the president. He wiped his eyes against the back of shirt and gave a soft chuckle. “Damn, all of this, just to learn a lesson straight out of a fairy tale.”<br><br>He looked upward, aware of the crowd in the darkness but no longer caring. They could watch all they wanted, but what they saw wasn’t half as important as what he did. They had no claim over his soul.<br><br>“Alright,” he said at long last. “Should we get this party over with?”<br><br>His wife took a step toward him. She smiled and raised the cake upward. “Come on, Bobby. Blow out the candles and make a wish.”<br><br>“Don’t blow it obsessing on things that never were,” said Shriver.<br><br>“Hope that people use this to build something better,” said Unruh.<br><br>“Try to make this life a good one,” said Long.<br><br>The president stared into the candles. He thought of Jack one last time. Then he took a deep breath in, held it, and blew. And with that, at last, the stage lights dimmed and the curtain closed.</p></div>`)

                After the days of waiting, the exhausting recounts, the final declarations and rosy press reports spinning his narrow victory, Bobby found himself alone again. He found himself picking confetti out of his suit and returning to his quiet office. He found days melt into weeks and a monotony reassert itself over the White House. Briefings came—about the situation in Vietnam, about the struggling economy, about unrest in the cities. The jubilation of Election Night vanished into memory and here, still, he remained. Older but not wiser. <br><br>With a brush of his hand, the president clicked the answering machine on his desk. He stood in the dark and waited. There was the whirring of tape and, then, the sudden intrusion of voices.<br><br>“Heya, Bobby! This is your sister Eunice! I’m afraid I’m out of the country so I’ll miss your birthday celebrations, but I wanted to give you my best anyways. Forty-seven! It’s hard to believe!  Try to take care of yourself, would you?”<br><br>Bobby shook his head and retrieved a bottle of whisky from a compartment behind his desk. <br><br>“Hi Robert, it’s Nick. Nick Arundel. I, uh, figured that your victory party two weeks ago was better than any present I could give, but I uhh… wanted to let you know I was still thinking of you. Looked touch-and-go for a bit, but we limped across the line. Hope to see you for lunch later this week to strategize on the Inauguration. Let’s try to do better than Robert Frost.”<br><br>Bobby tried not to look at the portrait of his brother on the wall. He took a sip from his glass and let its contents burn the inside of his mouth.<br><br>“Robert, it’s Jackie. Oh, I’m so sorry that I won’t be able to see you today, but I’m calling from Skorpios. Aristotle and I wanted to wish—.”<br><br>Bobby emptied his glass and hit the stop button on the answering machine with a hard swat. The voices vanished. He was alone again. He was alone again in the same room where Jack had spent the final hours of his life. All his friends. All these trappings of power. And what had it all been for? What was it that people even remembered? What was worth preserving?<br><br>He could still remember getting the call from his brother Ted, two days after his birthday. He had been staring at the mass of cheery birthday cards in his garbage bin as his brother wept through the phone, “I’m so sorry. Robert, I’m so sorry. In Dallas. They say in Dallas he was—. Oh Robert. Bobby. Oh, Bobby. I’m sorry he’s—.”<br><br>“Surprise!” <br><br>Lights blazed to life overhead. Robert dropped his glass as time came out of joint. He could suddenly see through the artifice, through the cheapness of the scenery. A paper American flag. A chipped desk. A plastic red telephone. Jack’s portrait. Less objects than a recreation of them. A memory. A haunting. <br><br>And then, situated across from him, a mass of faces. Ethel. Moynihan. Unruh. Shriver. Long. Connally. Byrd. McNamara. He stared uncomprehendingly at their smiling faces, at the cake in his wife’s outstretched arms, and then at what lay beyond them, stirring in the darkness beyond him.<br><br>“What—?”<br><br>“Oh happy birthday, Bobby!” said the crowd as one. <br><br>Bobby remained frozen beneath the spotlight. Wheels churned in his head. “You all—.”<br><br>“It was my idea, as usual,” said Moynihan, detaching himself from the mass. He adjusted his glasses and gave a bashful grin. “I know you don’t like to make a fuss about these things, but you’ve been running yourself ragged since the Election and we wanted to show you—.”<br><br>“That people still remember you, you old bat,” said Unruh in his deep baritone. “After all, how many times does a man turn 47? Christ, you’re finally old enough to fit in here.”<br><br>“Old as the Hill,” clucked Byrd.<br><br>“Older than Jack ever got to be,” muttered McNamara.<br><br>“And with more victories than he ever got,” said Connally in a wry voice. “Two.”<br><br>There was a snicker from somewhere in the dark beyond the scene. Bobby’s head turned toward the noise, toward the rows of bodies beyond his reach, rows that seemed to stretch infinitely outward.<br><br>“Is that all people remember? Is that what…” He took a shaky step toward the threshold.<br><br>“Well, <i>of course</i>,” said his brother-in-law Shriver. “Four more years in control of Washington isn’t nothing. You’ll always have been president. Just like Johnson. Like your brother.”<br><br>“What the hell did that bastard do again?” Joked Connally.<br><br>“Same as we did, I suppose,” muttered Long.<br><br>McNamara stared at his feet. “No great commitments. No great institutions. A yearning for…”<br><br>“Things that never were,” Bobby whispered. He felt himself looking out on the edge of some great threshold. If only he could see the faces of the people out there. If only he could touch them, make them understand, take control of the narrative. All those compromises… Lost futures… <br><br>He reached out a hand. <br><br>“Oh dear, our great communicator’s been rendered speechless,” said Shriver.<br><br>“I think he’s just calculating what to say,” said Long with forced cheer. <br><br>“Always the politician,” said Connally. “Even on his birthday, always the—.”<br><br>Robert felt someone approach from behind and his attention pull itself back toward the stage. He turned. There, standing next to him, was his wife Ethel. She looked at him and gave a sad smile, birthday cake in hand. The candles shimmered.<br><br>“Come on, Bobby. Blow out the candles and make a wish.”<br><br>“Try not to blow it this time,” said Byrd.<br><br>“Close your eyes.”<br><br>“Hope for something better.”<br><br>“Try to make it a good one.”<br><br>There was nowhere else to go. Nothing else to do. He gave one last look across the stage and then to the crowd judging him from beyond. Then, he shut his eyes, took a deep breath, and blew.</p></div>`)

Tell Byrd I said hello and no hard feelings about Long, would ya?” <br><br>Bobby shook his head and retrieved a bottle of whisky from a compartment behind his desk. <br><br>“Hi Robert, it’s Terry Sanford. I’m glad we got the chance to talk during your victory party a few nights back, but I thought you’d appreciate some birthday wishes too. A lot of fellas down here think you’re doing a great job. Don’t let the critics get you down, all right? Your family should be proud of what you’ve done.”<br><br>Bobby tried not to look at the portrait of his brother on the wall. He took a sip from his glass and let its contents burn the inside of his mouth.<br><br>“Robert, it’s Lem. Lem Billings. I uh… know we’ve had our differences, but I wanted to call and see how you’re doing on your birth—.”<br><br>Bobby emptied his glass and hit the stop button on the answering machine with a hard swat. The voices vanished. He was alone again. He was alone again in the same room where Jack had spent the final hours of his life. All his friends. All these trappings of power. And what had it all been for? What was it that people even remembered? What was worth preserving?<br><br>He could still remember getting the call from his brother Ted, two days after his birthday. He had been staring at the mass of cheery birthday cards in his garbage bin as his brother wept through the phone, “I’m so sorry. Robert, I’m so sorry. In Dallas. They say in Dallas he was—. Oh Robert. Bobby. Oh, Bobby. I’m sorry he’s—.”<br><br>“Surprise!” <br><br>Lights blazed to life overhead. Robert dropped his glass as time came out of joint. He could suddenly see through the artifice, through the cheapness of the scenery. A paper American flag. A chipped desk. A plastic red telephone. Jack’s portrait. Less objects than a recreation of them. A memory. A haunting. <br><br>And then, situated across from him, a mass of bodies. Ethel. Moynihan. Unruh. Shriver. Byrd. Connally. Long. McNamara. He stared uncomprehendingly at their smiling faces, at the cake in his wife’s outstretched arms, and then at what lay beyond them, stirring in the darkness beyond him.<br><br>“What—?”<br><br>“Oh happy birthday, Bobby!” said the crowd as one. <br><br>Bobby remained frozen beneath the spotlight. Wheels churned in his head. “You all—.”<br><br>“It was my idea, as usual,” said Moynihan, detaching himself from the mass. He adjusted his glasses and gave a bashful grin. “I know you don’t like to make a fuss about these things, but you’ve been running yourself ragged since the Election and we wanted to show you—.”<br><br>“That people still remember you, you old bat,” said Unruh in his deep baritone. “After all, how many times does a man turn 47? Christ, you’re finally old enough to fit in here.”<br><br>“Old enough to finally know who here butters your bread,” clucked Byrd with a look of pride.<br><br>“Older than Jack ever got to be,” muttered McNamara.<br><br>“And with more victories than he ever got,” said Connally in a wry voice. “Two.”<br><br>There was a snicker from somewhere in the dark beyond the scene. Bobby’s head turned toward the noise, toward the rows of bodies beyond his reach, rows that seemed to stretch infinitely outward.<br><br>“Is that all people remember? Is that what…” He took a shaky step toward the threshold.<br><br>“Well, <i>of course</i>,” said his brother-in-law Shriver. “Four more years in control of Washington isn’t nothing. You’ll always have been president. Just like Johnson. Like your brother.”<br><br>“And all it took was knowing who was disposable. All those people cast aside,” muttered Long. “But I suppose that’s the Kennedy way. And for what?”<br><br>“For power, what else is there?” said Byrd sharply. <br><br>McNamara stared at his feet. “Power for its own sake. Leaving behind no great institutions. No great commitments. All yearning for…”<br><br>“Things that never were,” Bobby whispered. He felt himself looking out on the edge of some great threshold. If only he could see the faces of the people out there. If only he could touch them, make them understand, take control of the narrative. All those compromises… Lost futures… <br><br>He reached out a hand. <br><br>“Oh dear, our great communicator’s been rendered speechless,” said Shriver.<br><br>“No, don’t belittle him. Our good ol’ boy is just calculating what to say,” said Byrd with forced cheer. <br><br>“Always the politician,” said Connally. “Even on his birthday, always the—.”<br><br>Robert felt someone approach from behind and his attention pull itself back toward the stage. He turned. There, standing next to him, was his wife Ethel. She looked at him and gave a sad smile, still balancing a birthday cake. The candles shimmered.<br><br>“Come on, Bobby. Blow out the candles and make a wish.”<br><br>“Try not to blow it this time,” said Long.<br><br>“Close your eyes.”<br><br>“Hope for something better.”<br><br>“Try to make it a good one.”<br><br>There was nowhere else to go. Nothing else to do. He gave one last look across the stage and then to the crowd judging him from beyond. Then, he shut his eyes, took a deep breath, and blew.</p></div>`)

                Robert F. Kennedy’s world had shrunk to a remarkable degree in the days since the Election. It wasn’t just the agonizing counts, the recounts, the lawsuits and countersuits. It wasn’t the inconclusive nature of the Election, the fact that he had been deprived of both a final, crushing defeat or liberating victory. It was the isolation. <br><br>With his allies scattered across the country, meeting with governors and congressmen in the desperate hopes that he could keep his job, and his aides telling him to remain in Washington to “appear in control” and “presidential”, Bobby had little to do but walk the halls. He felt like a ghost most nights, gliding through silent corridors, ruminating on the situation in Vietnam, the struggling economy, the unrest in cities. The few press events he allowed—how he hated the press and their goddamn nattering—left him feeling colder and more alone than anything else. He had no one who understood him. He had nothing to do. He’d be angry if he weren’t so depressed.<br><br>Without thinking, the president pushed his way into the unlit Oval Office. He approached the Resolute Desk. He did not dare to look at the stack of newspapers and briefings on the Election but instead focused on the blinking light of his answering machine. Before he could stop himself, he clicked the device and listened as a profusion of voices filled the room.<br><br>“Bobby, it’s Kenneth O'Donnell. The plan to swing the Electors was a bust. I’m on my way to talk to the governor but it really looks like we might be staring down the barrel here with the House.” A pause. “I’m sure this isn’t the birthday present you wanted, but I’ll keep you updated if things change.”<br><br>At the mention of his birthday, the president felt himself recoil. Such a silly, pointless thing to mention at a time like this. A light flickered somewhere in the room.<br><br>“Bob, it’s Larry O’Brien. I guess I should start by saying, happy birthday… Not every day a man turns forty-seven…” The president reflexively balled his fists. Why were people bothering him with this shit? “...but I’ll be meeting with Democratic leaders in New York tomorrow to discuss strategies on the contingent. I’ll let you know if there’s anything productive coming out of that.”<br><br>More flickering lights. A surprising heat despite the icy November weather outside. The president cast off his jacket without looking.<br><br>“Robert, darling, it’s Jackie. I hope you’re holding up well. I’m following the news about the Election in Greece and it’s just awful. On your birthday too. It’s just—.”<br><br>He slammed a finger against the STOP button and collapsed into his chair. Was his birthday the only fucking thing people remembered? The only real achievement he could claim? Was his only fucking merit in life persisting, going around the sun 47 times, being older than Jack ever was when he—.<br><br>Bobby gulped. He loosened his tie. It was so fucking hot. <br><br>He sat there in silence, hands over his eyes, sweat pouring out of him. It was a moment before he noticed the large stage lights overhead and the assemblage of pieces that his office had been transformed into. A plywood desk in place of the Resolute Desk. A worn roller chair where his high-backed seat should be. A papery American flag and a printed portrait of his brother, eyes cast downward. It was cheap. Tacky. <br><br>Across from him stood an array of figures—Ethel, Moynihan, Unruh, Shriver, Byrd, Connally, Long, and McNamara. Performers. Actors. Caricatures with wide smiles and exaggerated make-up. The kind of colorful characters, distorted and boiled down to their most essential characteristics, that might entertain.<br><br>Now, they stood as one. In Ethel’s hands was a large cake with lit candles.<br><br>“Is this what it was all for?” Bobby growled. “Is this what people get out of me?”<br><br>The group said nothing. Candles flickered beneath the intense stage lights. Shapes teemed in the darkness beyond them.<br><br>“When you take all of the pretensions away, is this all people commemorate? A birthday party. A young face with a complicated personality. Another fucking morality play to gawk at?”<br><br>More silence. Long gave him a pitying look. McNamara stared bleakly at the false portrait of Jack. <br><br>“Is that what you’re here for?” Bobby turned his attention past these shadows and toward the things out in the darkness beyond his reach. Row after row, they stretched before him. “A cherubic face and raging turmoil. A dark prince.” He spat the words. “Not anything I actually did or any movement I tried to lead. Not any of the work or… or…” <br><br>The mass said nothing. It did nothing. It merely stared at him from beyond the threshold. <br><br>““Could you name a single thing I did? A bill I passed? All this for what? To imagine things that never were?”<br><br>The silence was yawning. He felt like he could cry but he would not let them see his tears. He would not give them that satisfaction. <br><br>“Fuck off.” He turned his back to the audience. He stormed his way through the throng of actors, past a Connally who was more indignant that he had ever been, past a Byrd who seemed almost cartoonish in his bigotries, past a Long who was almost supernaturally weak. He ignored the silent Ethel and the cake in her outstretched hands.<br><br>“I’m not done yet. Okay? I still have work to do! I’m going to win this contingent election. I’m going to secure my legacy, Jack’s legacy. I’m going to pass bills and programs and be more than just a fucking name and a face on a wall. I’m not your paper doll. Do you understand? Do you—.”<br><br>He turned around but instead of the stage, he found himself back once more in his office. The room was empty. Papers lay scattered across the floor. His heart thumped furiously in his chest.<br><br>“I’ll show you,” he muttered. “I’m not done.”<br><br>His eyes flitted across the dark room. His eyes rested on the extinguished light of the answering machine.<br><br>“<i>I’m</i> in control. <i>I’m</i> the president. I get to say what gets remembered.”<br><br>Without another word, the president turned. As he exited the room, the scene once again plunged into darkness.<div id="coalitionList"></div></p></div>`)

                    After the days of waiting, the exhaustive recounts, the final result of the election was no longer avoidable. He had lost. Bobby had put on a brave face afterward, had conceded to his opponent who graciously accepted. Then he did what he always did when faced with unpleasant news—he buried himself in his work. Briefings came about the situation in Vietnam, about the struggling economy, about unrest in cities. He continued to issue orders as if they meant anything, as if his actions would not be immediately reversed by his successor. He felt like a child playing dress-up. He wasn’t growing up. He was growing down.<br><br>He shut the door to his Office, quiet but firm. He looked around the room, already in the process of being deconstructed for his successor, already with fewer papers sitting in his inbox. The only sight of life was the small red dot blinking on his answering machine. He pressed the “PLAY” button and pretended to work as the tape whirred to life.<br><br>“Hi Daddy, it’s Kathleen. I’m sorry I won’t be able to make it down to Washington for your birthday, but I’m just swamped with classes right now. Hope you’re carrying on okay given…” there was a long crackle of static through the machine. “Anyways, just wanted to let you know I was thinking about you. Call back when you have a moment.”<br><br>The paper on the top of his pile said something about agricultural insurance programs. Bobby tried to focus on the words.<br><br>“Hey, Robert. It’s Teddy. First, uh, happy birthday. I know you don’t like to celebrate it, but I didn’t think I could let the opportunity past by without… I mean 47’s a big one… you know…” More silence. Bobby thought he could detect a slight slurring in his brother’s words, a liquid sloshing around in glass. “You got a lot ahead of you is what I mean. We’ll figure out a way forward. Talk soon.”<br><br>There were many graphs in the packet, each illustrating the different outcomes of a possible change in federal regulation. <br><br>“Robert, it’s your mother. I know you think you can fool everyone else with the stip upper lip, but I know better. If you thought for a second that I’d let you become an ingrate, your father—.”<br><br>The president clicked the answering machine off and allowed the room to lapse into silence. He was alone again in the same room where Jack had spent the final hours of his life. Except unlike Jack, he hadn’t sacrificed anything. He hadn’t done anything that could not be immediately reversed. He’d had all these friends, all these trappings of power and, in the end, what would he be remembered for? A sad, one-term president? A gimmick? What had it all been for? What was worth preserving?<br><br>He could still remember getting the call from his brother Ted, two days after his birthday. He had been staring at the mass of cheery birthday cards in his garbage bin as his brother wept through the phone, “I’m so sorry. Robert, I’m so sorry. In Dallas. They say in Dallas he was—. Oh Robert. Bobby. Oh, Bobby. I’m sorry he’s—.”<br><br>“Surprise!” <br><br>Lights blared to life overhead. He dropped the paper he’d been holding and only now saw it for what it was, a cheap stage prop. He looked around his office to see it too transformed. He could see through the artifice, through the cheapness of the scenery. A paper American flag. A chipped desk. A plastic red telephone. Jack’s portrait. Less objects than a recreation of them. A memory. A haunting.<br><br>Then, situated across from him, a mass of bodies. Ethel. Moynihan. Unruh. Shriver. Byrd. Connally. Long. McNamara. He stared uncomprehendingly at their smiling faces, at the cake in his wife’s outstretched arms, and then at what lay beyond them, stirring in the darkness beyond him.<br><br>“Oh happy birthday, Bobby!” said the crowd as one. <br><br>Bobby remained frozen beneath the spotlight. Wheels churned in his head. “What is—?”<br><br>“A birthday party, you old bat,” said Moynihan, detaching himself from the mass. He adjusted his glasses. “I know you’ve been beating yourself up over the Election, but that’s no excuse to ignore a birthday party. I mean, you’re only 47!”<br><br>The president circled around his desk. He stared at the congregation and then tried to focus on the things beyond his reach. It was so hard with the blazing stage lights.<br><br>“But… I haven’t done anything worth commemorating,” he said in a whiny, child-like voice.<br><br>“Who has?” said Connally with a false levity. “Look, you’ll never have Jack’s good looks or his death, but think of how much time you’ll have.”<br><br>“So many parties left to go. You could live to be 80! 100!” said Unruh, nodding at the cake.<br><br>“Or 120,” said Byrd with a sly grin. “A regular Methuselah.” <br><br>“Always lingering,” said Long, his eyes cast downward.<br><br>“Time enough for people to forget the bad parts,” said McNamara.<br><br>“And only remember the good,” finished Shriver. “All those heady principles. Those speeches.”<br><br>“Much easier to celebrate without the actual difficult work of being president,” said Connally. “Maybe you could build some houses.”<br><br>The president stared. “That’s what I want. I never wanted to… to just be another face on the wall, to attend dinners and ceremonies for the rest of my life. I wanted to be a vehicle of change. I wanted to show people that greater things were possible. I wanted to show…”<br><br>“Things that never were.”<br><br>It was his wife’s voice that broke the silence this time. He turned to look at her. She had a strange, sad expression. The cake’s flickering candles made her look ghostly.<br><br>“Come on, Bobby, you had your chance,” she said quietly. “All that’s left now is to pick up the pieces and hope. It’s time to blow out your candles.”<br><br>“Try not to blow it this time,” said Long.<br><br>“Close your eyes.”<br><br>“Hope for something better.”<br><br>“Try to make it a good one.”<br><br>There was nowhere else to go. Nothing else to do. He gave one last look across the stage and then to the crowd judging him from beyond. Then, he shut his eyes, took a deep breath, and blew.</p></div>`)

                Something was wrong in Washington. Something had broken. All through the White House was a nervous energy, almost manic. His calls to Howard Hughes to concede in the days after the Election had gone unanswered. His Republican rivals had spent the past few days avoiding him and the press. The only voice at all in the election’s aftermath had been Robert Dole, his would-be opponent’s running mate, who emerged from his New York hotel sweaty and pale-faced. He had muttered a few things about a “historic outcome” and “the need to address challenges ahead” before vanishing himself into the Headquarters of the Republican National Convention.<br><br>Whatever self-pity he had had for himself had long since been buried by his growing sense of alarm. <i>Where was Howard Hughes?</i> He asked himself as days marched on, as the public became more frantically obsessed with their new would-be messiah, the man who had promised them that he would only appear to them when they had shown themselves worthy. <i>What the hell is going on?</i><br><br>Weeks passed. On November 20th, his birthday, he still found himself trying to grapple with the crisis. Briefings on Vietnam, the economy, the rising unrest in cities sat untouched on his desk in the Oval Office. His attention was focused solely on his answering machine.<br><br>“Mr. President,” came the voice of Ted Sorenson. “I’m in Summerlin, Nevada. I’ve been trying to get in contact with Mr. Hughes’s representatives at Summa Corp all day, but I haven’t been able to get through. I’m going to try to force myself into one of their offices around noon today to see if I can’t get their attention that way. I’ll send you an update when I have one.”<br><br>The answering machine clicked. A second message played.<br><br>“Robert, it’s Ted again. I… I went over to the Summa Corp. Headquarters and forced myself into a meeting. Said I was here from the President and wouldn’t leave, but the meeting isn’t what’s important. It’s—. They’re shredding papers, Robert. I’ve never seen anything like it. The whole building is shredding everything. They’re scared and skipping town. I’ll call you back as soon as I have something.”<br><br>Another click. Another message.<br><br>“Bobby. My God. They haven’t seen Hughes in years. Not just us. No one. I don’t think he’s in the country. I’m not even sure he’s alive. I know it sounds crazy, but we have a serious crisis on our hands. We might be—.”<br><br>The message was suddenly replaced by a terrible grinding noise. Bobby looked down to see his black ribbons of tape emerging from his answering machine, spilling out over the edge of his desk onto the floor. There was the smell of something burning. Acrid. He rushed toward the plug and pulled it from the wall. The grinding ceased and was replaced by the sound of his own heart thudding in his ears.<br><br><i>What have we done?</i> He wondered. <i>What on earth have we stumbled into?</i><br><br>He walked across the room, unnerved by the quiet. The Oval Office felt wrong. There was something wrong with the barometric pressure, like a light breeze just before the storm. Bobby gripped his arms tightly and held himself. He stared up at the enormous portrait of his brother on the wall. Was there something Jack would do now? Was there some wisdom he could leave behind? He racked his brain for some kernel of wisdom, some forgotten truth. Nothing answered him.<br><br>Instead, he felt a slight chill. He felt as he did on the last day before his brother had left for Dallas. He had tried to warn Jack. The trip felt wrong. It felt like something terrible was about to happen, like they were both going to stumble into it. There was something violent in the air. But all Jack had done was laugh and insist he was worrying too much. There was nothing to be afraid of. Everything was going to be—.<br><br>“Celebrity is a mask that eats into the face,” came a low, guttural voice from behind him. Bobby felt his blood freeze in his body. He did not turn. <br><br>Something shifted in the room behind him. It slouched, stumbled, near the space where his desk was. <br><br>“But it devours more than the wearer. It eats into the culture as well.”<br><br>He did not dare move his head, but he felt as if an enormous spotlight had been turned on both of them. In his mind’s eye, he could imagine it posing as Jack had once posed, arms stretched against the flat surface. A mockery of civic sainthood.<br><br>“It devours the past and puts something else in its place,” the voice was so soft he could barely hear it above the thundering of his heart. “It forces us to reinvent expedient gestures as moments of great moral weight.”<br><br>There was a long hacking set of coughs. Bobby’s eyes flitted around the place where he stood, but his office suddenly looked strange, unreal. The portrait of his brother was no longer a piece of art but a cheap, printed thing. The majestic flag at the corner of his vision had been reduced to cheap paper. His carpeting had become replaced with nondescript black wood and, beyond that, was an enormous void. One thousand seats stretched out before him, but he could not see who was seated in them.<br><br>“Nothing is ever how it was. They took my name and made it into something else.”<br><br>The unseen creature, the living corpse, was moving toward him now. He could hear its feet drag themselves across the stage. He stared intently at the flag near the edge of his vision. He stared at the pole. <br><br>“They’ll do the same to you.”<br><br>The thing was behind him. His hand fidgeted. The impossible audience leaned forward.</p></div>`)

                Bobby never had any false illusions about what the result of this election would be. Still, he tried to maintain his dignity. He had conceded early on Election Night, his surrender graciously accepted by his opponent. He had returned to a White House already beginning to thin as staff looked for other jobs and opportunities. He had pushed forward by doing what he had always done—burying himself in his work. He accepted briefings on the situation in Vietnam, on the struggling economy, on the unrest in cities. <br><br>He gave speeches and issued orders, trying his hardest to ignore the obvious absurdity of it all. Anything he did now would likely be reversed by his successor. He wasn’t president at all. He was a child playing dress up. He wasn’t growing up. He was growing down. As he looked at the newspapers bemoaning every aspect of his Administration, it felt like the entire nation was doing the same.<br><br>Still, he pressed onward. He pressed himself through empty White House hallways, past Secret Service agents who looked at him with a mix of curiosity and sadness. He sealed himself inside his Office, once again ignoring pleas from his wife and his children to enjoy what time he had remaining. He had no intention of doing that. <br><br>There was work to be done. Phone calls to be answered. The answering machine on his desk blinked. Without hesitation, he clicked the button labeled “PLAY”. As the tape whirred, he pretended to organize his paperwork.<br><br>“Bob, it’s Larry O’Brien. I was surprised to receive your call the other day, but I wanted to return it and, uh, wish you a happy birthday.” There was a pause. Something going unsaid. “I’d be happy to help with whatever project you got cooked up after January, but, uh, let’s table that, alright? It’s only been a few weeks.”<br><br>The president scowled. He moved several useless papers from his inbox to his outbox.<br><br>“Bobby, this is Jeff Greenfield. First off, congrats on turning 47. Second, I, uh, got your message about wanting to do a Farewell Address. I’m not sure if you’ve seen the polling numbers recently, but we should maybe discuss options before we go that direction. I’ll send you a memo.”<br><br>Bobby gathered up a collection of documents and slammed them into his garbage bin. He did nothing when the bin tipped sideways.<br><br>“Mr. President, this is Earl Graves. I appreciate you reaching out on your birthday and all, but I don’t think, this close after the election, is the right time to reach out to black—.”<br><br>The president jerked the answering machine toward him and hit the “STOP” button with his thumb. The room lapsed itself into silence. He was alone again. He was alone again in the same room where Jack had spent the last few hours of his life. Unlike Jack, there was no possibility of making his presidency mean anything, of the fight for civil rights or economic justice continue. Instead of being martyred for something greater than himself, his defeat had made his ideas smaller and more marginal. <br><br>Had Jack feared this? As his car glided down those Dallas streets, had he worried that his vitality would be sapped from him? That he might disappoint the country in ‘64 and everything he fought for and believed in would be forgotten?<br><br>He could still remember getting the call from his brother Ted, two days after his birthday. He had been staring at the mass of cheery birthday cards in his garbage bin as his brother wept through the phone, “I’m so sorry. Robert, I’m so sorry. In Dallas. They say in Dallas he was—. Oh Robert. Bobby. Oh, Bobby. I’m sorry he’s—.”<br><br>“Surprise!” <br><br>Lights blared to life overhead. He dropped the papers he’d been holding and only now saw it for what they were—a cheap stage prop. He looked around his office to see it too transformed. He could see through the artifice, through the cheapness of the scenery. A paper American flag. A chipped desk. A plastic red telephone. Jack’s portrait. Less objects than a recreation of them. A memory. A haunting.<br><br>Then, situated across from him, a mass of bodies. Ethel. Moynihan. Unruh. Shriver. Byrd. Connally. Long. McNamara. He stared uncomprehendingly at their smiling faces, at the cake in his wife’s outstretched arms, and then at what lay beyond them, stirring in the darkness beyond him.<br><br>“Oh happy birthday, Bobby!” said the crowd as one. <br><br>Bobby remained frozen beneath the spotlight. His mouth opened and shut as his brain processed what was happening. “N-No… No, this isn’t…”<br><br>“Isn’t what, Bobby-buddy?” said Connally with an exaggerated wink. “Forty-seven is nothing to scoff at. Hell, that’s more birthdays than Jack got.”<br><br>“No. No, I mean, this isn’t what I came here to do. I have work. I have so much work to—.” He was rambling, he knew. His mouth felt dry. <br><br>“Christ, kiddo, leave the work for someone more capable,” said Byrd, detaching himself from the crowd to pick up the papers strewn across the stage. “Haven’t you made enough of a mess already? I mean, God, the stories people will tell about this…”<br><br>“Bobby the fumbler. Bobby the dunce,” said Long, observing Byrd. He frowned. “It doesn’t really have the same ring to it.”<br><br>Shriver cut in, “But I’m sure you’ll be around for a long enough time to make it mean something. You could live another 60, 70 years if you’re lucky. By that time, all these fights about Vietnam, the economy… they’ll seem like nothing.”<br><br>“Will be nothing,” Byrd corrected, now back on his feet.<br><br>“You’ll have your library, your parties to focus on the good stuff like your speeches. All your petty little family dramas. Oh, boy, they’ll get a kick out of the Jack thing. Very cinematic, very <i>theatrical</i>,”  said Connally. “They’ll find meaning in that, long after they’ve forgotten everything you stood for.”<br><br>There was a guffaw of laughter from somewhere out in the darkness. Bobby spun to face it. If he focused hard, he could just make out the masses beyond those stage lights. Countless generations, all watching him. If he could just reach them, hold their hands…<br><br>“No, it was never about any of that,” muttered Kennedy, still staring into the dark. “I never wanted to be just another face on the wall. We were supposed to finish the work. We were supposed to do something, to embody change…”<br><br>“Strange way of embodying it,” said Long. “All those compromises.”<br><br>“All those dead,” said McNamara in a dark and sullen voice.<br><br>There was a long sigh as Moynihan adjusted his spectacles. “Oh, not to worry, Bobby. This country’s yet to find a president it couldn’t add to the pantheon. You’ll maybe not be as bright a star, but you’ll be fine. You lot always are.”<br><br>The president took a step away from the stage’s edge. “This can’t be how it ends. It just can’t,” he muttered. “What about all those possibilities we used to dream of? What about those…”<br><br>“Things that never were?”<br><br>It was his wife’s voice that broke the silence this time. He turned to look at her. She had a strange, sad expression. The cake’s flickering candles made her look ghostly.<br><br>“Come on, Bobby, you had your chance,” she said quietly. “All that’s left now is to pick up the pieces and get off the stage. It’s time to blow out your candles.”<br><br>“Try not to blow it this time,” said Long.<br><br>“Close your eyes.”<br><br>“Hope for something better.”<br><br>“Try to make it a good one.”<br><br>There was nowhere else to go. Nothing else to do. He gave one last look across the stage and then to the crowd judging him from beyond. Then, he shut his eyes, took a deep breath, and blew.</p></div>`)

                Something was wrong in Washington. Something had broken. All through the White House was a nervous energy, almost manic. His calls to Howard Hughes to concede in the days after the Election had gone unanswered. His Republican rivals had spent the past few days avoiding him and the press. The only voice at all in the election’s aftermath had been Robert Dole, his would-be opponent’s running mate, who emerged from his New York hotel sweaty and pale-faced. He had muttered a few things about a “historic outcome” and “the need to address challenges ahead” before vanishing himself into the Headquarters of the Republican National Convention.<br><br>Whatever self-pity he had had for himself had long since been buried by his growing sense of alarm. <i>Where was Howard Hughes?</i> He asked himself as days marched on, as the public became more frantically obsessed with their new would-be messiah, the man who had promised them that he would only appear to them when they had shown themselves worthy. <i>What the hell is going on?</i><br><br>Weeks passed. On November 20th, his birthday, he still found himself trying to grapple with the crisis. Briefings on Vietnam, the economy, the rising unrest in cities sat untouched on his desk in the Oval Office. His attention was focused solely on his answering machine.<br><br>“Mr. President,” came the voice of Ted Sorenson. “I’m in Summerlin, Nevada. I’ve been trying to get in contact with Mr. Hughes’s representatives at Summa Corp all day, but I haven’t been able to get through. I’m going to try to force myself into one of their offices around noon today to see if I can’t get their attention that way. I’ll send you an update when I have one.”<br><br>The answering machine clicked. A second message played.<br><br>“Robert, it’s Ted again. I… I went over to the Summa Corp. Headquarters and forced myself into a meeting. Said I was here from the President and wouldn’t leave, but the meeting isn’t what’s important. It’s—. They’re shredding papers, Robert. I’ve never seen anything like it. The whole building is shredding everything. They’re scared and skipping town. I’ll call you back as soon as I have something.”<br><br>Another click. Another message.<br><br>“Bobby. My God. They haven’t seen Hughes in years. Not just us. No one. I don’t think he’s in the country. I’m not even sure he’s alive. I know it sounds crazy, but we have a serious crisis on our hands. We might be—.”<br><br>The message was suddenly replaced by a terrible grinding noise. Bobby looked down to see his black ribbons of tape emerging from his answering machine, spilling out over the edge of his desk onto the floor. There was the smell of something burning. Acrid. He rushed toward the plug and pulled it from the wall. The grinding ceased and was replaced by the sound of his own heart thudding in his ears.<br><br><i>What have we done?</i> He wondered. <i>What on earth have we stumbled into?</i><br><br>He walked across the room, unnerved by the quiet. The Oval Office felt wrong. There was something wrong with the barometric pressure, like a light breeze just before the storm. Bobby gripped his arms tightly and held himself. He stared up at the enormous portrait of his brother on the wall. Was there something Jack would do now? Was there some wisdom he could leave behind? He racked his brain for some kernel of wisdom, some forgotten truth. Nothing answered him.<br><br>Instead, he felt a slight chill. He felt as he did on the last day before his brother had left for Dallas. He had tried to warn Jack. The trip felt wrong. It felt like something terrible was about to happen, like they were both going to stumble into it. There was something violent in the air. But all Jack had done was laugh and insist he was worrying too much. There was nothing to be afraid of. Everything was going to be—.<br><br>“Celebrity is a mask that eats into the face,” came a low, guttural voice from behind him. Bobby felt his blood freeze in his body. He did not turn. <br><br>Something shifted in the room behind him. It slouched, stumbled, near the space where his desk was. <br><br>“But it devours more than the wearer. It eats into the culture as well.”<br><br>He did not dare move his head, but he felt as if an enormous spotlight had been turned on both of them. In his mind’s eye, he could imagine it posing as Jack had once posed, arms stretched against the flat surface. A mockery of civic sainthood.<br><br>“It devours the past and puts something else in its place,” the voice was so soft he could barely hear it above the thundering of his heart. “It forces us to reinvent expedient gestures as moments of great moral weight.”<br><br>There was a long hacking set of coughs. Bobby’s eyes flitted around the place where he stood, but his office suddenly looked strange, unreal. The portrait of his brother was no longer a piece of art but a cheap, printed thing. The majestic flag at the corner of his vision had been reduced to cheap paper. His carpeting had become replaced with nondescript black wood and, beyond that, was an enormous void. One thousand seats stretched out before him, but he could not see who was seated in them.<br><br>“Nothing is ever how it was. They took my name and made it into something else.”<br><br>The unseen creature, the living corpse, was moving toward him now. He could hear its feet drag themselves across the stage. He stared intently at the flag near the edge of his vision. He stared at the pole. <br><br>“They’ll do the same to you.”<br><br>The thing was behind him. His hand fidgeted. The impossible audience leaned forward.</p></div>`)

            Robert F. Kennedy’s world had shrunk to a remarkable degree in the days since the Election. It wasn’t just the agonizing counts, the recounts, the lawsuits and countersuits. It wasn’t the inconclusive nature of the Election, the fact that he had been deprived of both a final, crushing defeat or liberating victory. It was the isolation. <br><br>With his allies scattered across the country, meeting with governors and congressmen in the desperate hopes that he could keep his job, and his aides telling him to remain in Washington to “appear in control” and “presidential”, Bobby had little to do but walk the halls. He felt like a ghost most nights, gliding through silent corridors, ruminating on the situation in Vietnam, the struggling economy, the unrest in cities. The few press events he allowed—how he hated the press and their goddamn nattering—left him feeling colder and more alone than anything else. He had no one who understood him. He had nothing to do. He’d be angry if he weren’t so depressed.<br><br>Without thinking, the president pushed his way into the unlit Oval Office. He approached the Resolute Desk. He did not dare to look at the stack of newspapers and briefings on the Election but instead focused on the blinking light of his answering machine. Before he could stop himself, he clicked the device and listened as a profusion of voices filled the room.<br><br>“Bobby, it’s Kenneth O'Donnell. The plan to swing the Electors was a bust. I’m on my way to talk to the governor but it really looks like we might be staring down the barrel here with the House.” A pause. “I’m sure this isn’t the birthday present you wanted, but I’ll keep you updated if things change.”<br><br>At the mention of his birthday, the president felt himself recoil. Such a silly, pointless thing to mention at a time like this. A light flickered somewhere in the room.<br><br>“Bob, it’s Larry O’Brien. I guess I should start by saying, happy birthday… Not every day a man turns forty-seven…” The president reflexively balled his fists. Why were people bothering him with this shit? “...but I’ll be meeting with Democratic leaders in New York tomorrow to discuss strategies on the contingent. I’ll let you know if there’s anything productive coming out of that.”<br><br>More flickering lights. A surprising heat despite the icy November weather outside. The president cast off his jacket without looking.<br><br>“Robert, darling, it’s Jackie. I hope you’re holding up well. I’m following the news about the Election in Greece and it’s just awful. On your birthday too. It’s just—.”<br><br>He slammed a finger against the STOP button and collapsed into his chair. Was his birthday the only fucking thing people remembered? The only real achievement he could claim? Was his only fucking merit in life persisting, going around the sun 47 times, being older than Jack ever was when he—.<br><br>Bobby gulped. He loosened his tie. It was so fucking hot. <br><br>He sat there in silence, hands over his eyes, sweat pouring out of him. It was a moment before he noticed the large stage lights overhead and the assemblage of pieces that his office had been transformed into. A plywood desk in place of the Resolute Desk. A worn roller chair where his high-backed seat should be. A papery American flag and a printed portrait of his brother, eyes cast downward. It was cheap. Tacky. <br><br>Across from him stood an array of figures—Ethel, Moynihan, Unruh, Shriver, Byrd, Connally, Long, and McNamara. Performers. Actors. Caricatures with wide smiles and exaggerated make-up. The kind of colorful characters, distorted and boiled down to their most essential characteristics, that might entertain.<br><br>Now, they stood as one. In Ethel’s hands was a large cake with lit candles.<br><br>“Is this what it was all for?” Bobby growled. “Is this what people get out of me?”<br><br>The group said nothing. Candles flickered beneath the intense stage lights. Shapes teemed in the darkness beyond them.<br><br>“When you take all of the pretensions away, is this all people commemorate? A birthday party. A young face with a complicated personality. Another fucking morality play to gawk at?”<br><br>More silence. Long gave him a pitying look. McNamara stared bleakly at the false portrait of Jack. <br><br>“Is that what you’re here for?” Bobby turned his attention past these shadows and toward the things out in the darkness beyond his reach. Row after row, they stretched before him. “A cherubic face and raging turmoil. A dark prince.” He spat the words. “Not anything I actually did or any movement I tried to lead. Not any of the work or… or…” <br><br>The mass said nothing. It did nothing. It merely stared at him from beyond the threshold. <br><br>““Could you name a single thing I did? A bill I passed? All this for what? To imagine things that never were?”<br><br>The silence was yawning. He felt like he could cry but he would not let them see his tears. He would not give them that satisfaction. <br><br>“Fuck off.” He turned his back to the audience. He stormed his way through the throng of actors, past a Connally who was more indignant that he had ever been, past a Byrd who seemed almost cartoonish in his bigotries, past a Long who was almost supernaturally weak. He ignored the silent Ethel and the cake in her outstretched hands.<br><br>“I’m not done yet. Okay? I still have work to do! I’m going to win this contingent election. I’m going to secure my legacy, Jack’s legacy. I’m going to pass bills and programs and be more than just a fucking name and a face on a wall. I’m not your paper doll. Do you understand? Do you—.”<br><br>He turned around but instead of the stage, he found himself back once more in his office. The room was empty. Papers lay scattered across the floor. His heart thumped furiously in his chest.<br><br>“I’ll show you,” he muttered. “I’m not done.”<br><br>His eyes flitted across the dark room. His eyes rested on the extinguished light of the answering machine.<br><br>“<i>I’m</i> in control. <i>I’m</i> the president. I get to say what gets remembered.”<br><br>Without another word, the president turned. As he exited the room, the scene once again plunged into darkness.</p></div>`)

Kennedy, Sr. (probably)<br><br><small>by <b><u>Benny Johnson</u></b><br>BuzzFeed Staff</small><br><br><span style=\"background-color:#5246F5; color:#FFFFFF; border-radius:5px;\">💬 View All 181 Comments</span><br><br><strong>We can all agree that politics nowadays can be pretty disheartening.<br><br><img style="max-width:300px; height:auto;" src="https://i.imgur.com/pvHlWx6.png"><br><br>Fortunately for us, there’s still a few things that can still bring people together and remind us what being an American is all about.<br><br><img style="max-width:300px; width:auto;" src="https://i.imgur.com/BiR6lIi.jpeg"><br><br>For those of you living under a rock, <i>Things That Never Were</i> is (finally!) returning to the Broadway stage. After a brief interregnum due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the much-loved sensation about our 37th President is set to return to the Gershwin Theatre—where we hope it will remain forever.<br><br>There’s just one question on everyone’s mind. Who will show up for the star-studded, red carpet premiere? While many celebrities (from Mel Gibson to Meryl Streep) have already <span style="color:#0F65EF">confirmed</span> they’ll be present for this exclusive event, America’s own political royalty have stayed mum on their plans. <br><br>Here’s a list of the top five Kennedys we’re hoping will make an appearance.<br><br><b>5. Joseph P. Kennedy III</b><br><br><img style="max-width:300px; width:auto;" src="https://i.imgur.com/dU8AZVl.jpeg"><br><br>Starting us off on the list is POTUS himself, Joseph P. Kennedy III! While some people think that the president should be dealing with “official business” (like the fighting in the West Bank and his stalled <span style="color:#0F65EF">infrastructure package</span>), JPK III has always known how to put on a show for the public. <br><br>His decision to recreate his grand-uncle JFK’s “We choose to go to the Moon” speech during his last term sent our hearts soaring. His promise to work with <span style="color:#0F65EF">Jeff Bezos</span> to get a man on Mars by 2029 gives us all something to look forward to amid looming government dysfunction.<br><br>Let’s just hope he visits the red carpet before the red planet! <br><br><b>4. Maria Shriver</b><br><br><img style="max-width:300px; width:auto;" src="https://i.imgur.com/CowY9ZC.jpeg"><br><br>America’s princess is all grown up! While some people don’t think of the Shrivers as “real Kennedys”, Sargent Shriver more than proved his Kennedy bona fides during his two terms by using his charisma (and a heavy dollop of old-fashioned American firepower) to resolve the energy crisis of the late 1970s. We thank him for keeping oil prices low and the economy moving.<br><br>But more than that, we thank him for giving us his daughter, Maria, who stole our hearts with displays of genuine compassion. After the Cleveland Riots, Maria was one of the first on the scene to express her “<span style="color:#0F65EF">sympathy</span>” for those whose bodies were impacted by policing-related bullets. Her dances with King Charles, King Talal of Saudi Arabia, and President Pinochet of Chile showed that America is just as good with soft power as it is hard. <br><br>Her status as First Daughter made her revered around the globe. Her marriage to Austrian model <span style="color:#0F65EF">Arnold Schwarzenagger</span> set television records. An appearance at the <i>Things That Never Were</i> premiere could do the same.<br><br><b>3. John F. Kennedy, Jr.</b><br><br><img style="max-width:300px; width:auto;" src="https://i.imgur.com/sIcrNjy.jpeg"><br><br>The “black sheep” of the Kennedy family, former president John F. Kennedy, Jr., has been sparse with his appearances since his devastating loss in 2004 to Ross Perot. Aside from his <span style="color:#0F65EF">lifestyle podcast</span>, his <span style="color:#0F65EF">brand deals</span>, and <span style="color:#0F65EF">Instagram posts</span>, the one-time, one-term president has been almost absent from American public life.<br><br>But there’s been recent rumblings of a Jr. renaissance in Washington. Though his escapades in the Middle East (and in <span style="color:#0F65EF">the bedroom!</span>) were once considered to be a black mark on the family legacy, foreign policy experts are starting to re-evaluate the Princeling President’s decision-making. His air strikes against Iraq, Syria, and Libya are now considered foundational to the JPK III “Maximalist Monroe” doctrine. Even America’s right wing (still divided between half-a-dozen small parties built around one or two celebs) consider his military action in Latin America to be “undoing the mistakes his father made in the Bay of Pigs”.<br><br>Wow! Let’s hope the Jr. Train keeps chugging into the <i>TTNW</i> station this Friday.<br><br><b>2. Harper, Owen, Nora, and Neil Kennedy</b><br><br><img style="max-width:300px; width:auto;" src="https://i.imgur.com/UuwRYEB.jpeg"><br><br>We couldn’t let this list end without acknowledging the cutest members of the Kennedy Clan—Treasury Secretary Patrick J. Kennedy’s heirs, Harper, Owen, and Neil.<br><br>During the pandemic, pictures of these kiddos are what kept us going. When lockdown first started, video of Nora bursting into her father’s office made us laugh. When Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. said that the total number of deaths had “exceeded projections”, America was soothed by Nora singing the title song of “Things That Never Were”. When President Romney announced an end to pandemic relief and the stock market tanked, the family released a video from their Cape Cod estate saying they were there for us.<br><br>Some think Patrick J. Kennedy should stay away from the spotlight after his alleged run-in with the cops even though he was <span style="color:#0F65EF">pardoned</span> and received an <span style="color:#0F65EF">apology</span> from the arresting officer. Even if that’s true, we don’t think a single beer should ruin anyone’s life. After all, we’re a country that believes in second chances.<br><br><b>1. The Man of the Hour Himself, Robert F. Kennedy</b><br><br><img style="max-width:300px; width:auto;" src="https://i.imgur.com/cx94PHm.png"><br><br>Finally, we have the man we <i>all</i> want to appear—Robert F. Kennedy himself!<br><br>It’s been hard to pin the celebrity president down since leaving Office. After his shocking, near-assassination (beautifully dramatized by Aaron Sorkin in his film <span style="color:#0F65EF"><i>Dallas</i></span>), the Dark Prince of the Clan tried to make himself invisible. He barely did public signings of any bills and even declined to appear for State of the Union Addresses, preferring instead to send <span style="color:#0F65EF">a letter</span> (which is technically legal! Every president up until <span style="color:#0F65EF">Woodrow Wilson</span> did it!). It was as if the government was running on auto-pilot.<br><br>Then, <i>Things That Never Were</i> hit Broadway in 1975. Its meteoric success (despite <span style="color:#0F65EF">negative reviews from a few snobby critics</span>) reminded everyone why they loved Bobby in the first place! Inspiring <span style="color:#0F65EF">songs</span>, <span style="color:#0F65EF">documentaries</span>, and <span style="color:#0F65EF">books</span>, the showstopper made sure he could no longer hide. America was never going to move past this 70s icon! <br><br>The family makes many statements on his behalf (for example, using him to <span style="color:#0F65EF">win support for John Jr’s Invasion of Venezuela</span> and for <span style="color:#0F65EF">JPK III’s infrastructure bill</span>). His last major appearance, however, was in 2009 when he made an unexpected appearance at the Robert–Ethel Kennedy Foundation for an event commemorating the 40th anniversary of his inauguration. The icon tried to downplay his celebrity, focusing on boring issues like welfare policy and Vietnam (honk shoo). It wasn’t until a <i>Things That Never Were</i> truefan started asking him about the musical and how it felt to be “an icon” that he became the Brooding Bobby that we all know and love. <br><br>“What was it all for?” he cried, inspiring applause from the audience (<span style="color:#0F65EF">video here</span>). <br><br>That’s an easy question to answer, Bobby. It was all for you!</strong></span></p></div>`)

                <i>Mr. Could-a, Would-a, Should-a</i></h3><p><span style=\"color:#d6ced6;\"><b>By Alan Smith</b><i>, a theater director and critic at n+1</i><br><br>
                In the mid-1980s, Italian writer and academic Umberto Eco began screening the film <i>Casablanca</i> to a group of American students. While never a fan of the movie itself, Eco found himself riveted at how the students would “greet each scene  and canonical line of dialogue (“Round up the usual suspects,” “Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?”–or even every time that Bogey says “kid”) with ovations usually reserved for football games. He wondered why it was that audiences responded with such enthusiasm, why it inspired such fascination despite it being, in his words, “a very mediocre film.” <br><br>“It is a comic strip, a hotch-potch,” he wrote, “low on psychological credibility, and with little continuity in its dramatic effects.” Yet, the film was an amazing success, one whose cliches elevated the production instead of diminishing it. The secret, Eco thought, was that the film was made up as it was shot. No one, not even the director, knew what the characters would say or do or which lover Ilse would eventually leave with. <br><br>Forced to improvise, the director, cast, and crew “mixed in a little of everything… When the choice of the tried and true is limited, the result is a trite or mass-produced film, or simply kitsch. But when the tried and true repertoire is used wholesale, the result is architecture like Gaudi’s Sagrada Familia in Barcelona. There is a sense of dizziness, a stroke of brilliance.” <i>Casablanca</i> is not just one film, it is many films. <br><br>“When all the archetypes burst in shamelessly, we reach Homeric depths. Two cliches make us laugh. A hundred cliches move us,” Eco wrote.<br><br>The same could be said of <i>Things That Never Were</i>, the 1977 musical drama whose revival is currently being staged at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre. Written amid the final days of the Robert F. Kennedy Administration, the still-anonymous (and <span style="color:#2745B6;"><u>much debated</u></span>) librettist and lyricist in a little of everything. He threw in the bubbly comedy of <i>How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying</i>. He applied the vignettes and framing device of <i>Company</i>. There’s even a little bit of <i>Cabaret</i> with its tumultuous second act, a sense that the party is over and the world that birthed Bobby Kennedy is coming apart at its seams.<br><br>In truth, there is little originality in <i>Things That Never Were</i>, at least nothing that wasn’t done first and better in other stage shows. Yet, much like <i>Casablanca</i>, audiences cannot seem to get enough of it. The current Broadway production is in the middle of a <span style="color:#2745B6;"><u>sold-out run</u></span>, despite <span style="color:#2745B6;"><u>mixed reviews</u></span>. It has inspired no less than five film adaptations and been cited as a favorite by <span style="color:#2745B6;"><u>three presidents</u></span>. It has become so indelibly associated with the American presidency that U.S. Marine Band played an orchestral version of the opening number— “A Fair World”—at <span style="color:#2745B6;"><u>Kaine’s inauguration</u></span> this January, the implications apparently lost on the participants.<br><br>Only one recent production of has seemed to understand its subject matter and it was, perhaps pointedly, not done by an American at all. In 2014, Soviet director Kirill Serebrennikov staged an unauthorized production to protest intensifying US sanctions on Cuba and Vietnam and President Harold Ford’s propagation of the POW-MIA myth. In that rendition, audience members, silent and dressed in masks, were invited to clog the stage as the actors performed. Instead of the president’s near-assassination (the most iconic moment of the fictional and real Kennedy’s life), he is instead swallowed by the crowd and vanishes. The play then abruptly ended, without resolution.<br><br>What Serebrennikov understood is that Things That Never Were, more than a cavalcade of cliches, is a ghost story. It is a musical that allows America to reflexively, obsessively revisit the traumas of the late 1960s and early 1970s. When Americans see the tortured Bobby, they do not just see the real Kennedy that <span style="color:#2745B6;"><u>vanished</span></u> shortly after his assassination attempt, governing in near silence and solitude. They see sad reflections of his successors—Percy, Hooker, Quayle, Hart, Gingrich, Wilson. They see an endless array of presidents without significant accomplishments, unable to commit decisively to any path. They see a set of fabulous failures whose charisma and glamour disguise a country that is stagnating and out of ideas. <br><br>The last major attempt to reimagine welfare took place under Lyndon Johnson. US officials continue to fret about “Vietnam Syndrome” even as they trap themselves in near-identical entanglements across the Sahel. Reboots and reimaginings of decades-old properties dot the popular culture landscape. Turnout at the last election fell to almost <span style="color:#2745B6;"><u>40%</u></span> as candidates from both parties tried to claim the mantle of the silent, 99-year-old Kennedy scion. <br><br>Perhaps the reason why so many find themselves transfixed by this fictional Bobby Kennedy is a hope that he might escape the well of cliches that we too have found ourselves trapped in. We watch him like one watches Orpheus leading Eurydice out of hell, praying that this time the story might be different, that he won’t look back.<br><br>We live on the hope of a better ending. We pray for things that never were.</span></p></div>`)

It took determination, grit, and working across the aisle to even get him back into the oval office for term two; that was a lesson Kennedy would take to heart. His once flaming heart liberal core would fade away, replaced by a hardened spirit. One which would see America embark on more and greater crises, and would see Kennedy revive his reputation.<br><br>Perhaps the first and most immediate reaction to the contested election would be Kennedy’s major initiative, the Scott-Sparkman tax cuts. The beginnings of his bipartisan legislation overhauled the tax code, cutting taxes for the top and middle bracket to encourage greater innovation across America. It also offered greater tax credits and breaks to small business owners, encouraging younger citizens to start businesses.<br><br>The second, and perhaps more important of Kennedy’s second term overhauls, brought crime to a screeching halt across America, by enforcing the laws on the books more strictly via the Kennedy Crime Bill. No more would criminals picked up for drug usage be back out on the street just moments later; no, instead, they’d be hauled off to jails, properly preventing the degradation of our streets in urban areas. Packaged along with this came a sharp increase in federal grants for urban police departments such as the NYPD or LAPD, to prioritize their ability to enforce the laws in urban ghettos which had long been ignored.<br><br>Nevertheless, the speed bumps presented by the oil crisis slowed down the administration massively. RFK bravely deployed troops to several areas in an attempt to protect American supply lines, but ultimately, he faltered, and gas prices increased further against Kennedy’s wishes.<br><br>What came next was a wipeout in 1974. But despite the hostile congress, Kennedy still worked to pass common sense environmental policy, such as the establishment of the Environmental Defense Agency. Ultimately, it’s important to reflect on the lessons learned from RFK term two, and its follow up, the Rhodes Presidency, that centrist governance works; and that even in the worst of situations, one may always come out with a clean few victories by working across the aisle. You cannot understand the Kennedy legacy without understanding the values of good governance.</span></p></div>`)

Beyond the game, last night left us with many questions about both teams' directions. After leading his team to a devastating loss, Head Coach Scott Frost's career may be on the clock. Even despite their win, the Washington Kennedys have problems of their own. With MVP RG3 suffering a potentially debilitating injury, they may be on the lookout for a new star player.<br><br>Yet when the confetti rained down, the fans roared, and RG3 lifted that trophy overhead from the stretcher, all those questions felt meaningless. The Washington Kennedys have finally done it; after two prior attempts, they secured a historic threepeat in a shutout against the New England Patriots. So, let's focus on the moments that made that night meaningful.<br><br><h4>Griffin and Bush's Bromance</h4>Tragically, in the first quarter, the Kennedy's Quarterback, Robert Griffin III, suffered an injury, leaving him with a torn ACL, forcing his removal from the game. In a remarkable show of sportsmanship, a so-called Patriots fan, President Bush, visited Griffin down at the bench shortly after halftime.<br><br>Griffin said this when asked about the exchange during a post-game interview: "It was humbling for sure." Speaking on the historic first of a President's visit to a bowl game. "Truthfully, I think it's what we needed now. You know- he didn't show up for himself. [...] Sports shouldn't be about politics, and I'm glad he didn't let any views separate us."<br>Griffin added, "He asked if I had a cast he could sign. He said he'd brought a sharpie down and everything," inspiring sparse laughter in the room. After a pause, Griffin inserted, "I think he was joking."<br><br>The President and MVP continued their pleasantries through the night, with the President retweeting Griffin's celebratory tweet on the @POTUS Twitter handle.<br><br><div class="tweet-container">    <div class="profile">        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/j11kdcZ.jpeg" alt="Profile Picture">        <div>            <div class="username" style="color:#F7F9F9">Robert Griffin III <span class="handle">@RGIII</span></div>            <div class="timestamp">1d</div>        </div>    </div>    <div class="tweet-content">        <p style="color:#F7F9F9">Humbled. GOD WINS.</p>    </div>    <div class="tweet-actions">        <span>💬 1.2k</span>        <span>🔁 8.1k</span>        <span>❤️ 101k</span>    </div></div><br><br>Griffin's kind post-game words must not have reached these fans, however, who burnt an effigy of the President in the streets of Richmond later that night.<br><br><h4>Broadway Invades Boston</h4>Though no one hopes for an artist to bomb in front of the largest audience in the country, critics' expectations for Jake Novak were set at historic lows. However, when he opened with the title track from <i>Things That Never Were</i>, all gripes of anybody watching were laid to bed instantaneously.<br><br>Novak proved that Broadway has just as much right to headline the halftime show as even the hottest stars, like Rush and Mumford and Sons. Novak brought a range of emotions with his setlist, from the cheerful <i>Las Vegas</i>, to the dreary <i>End This War</i>. Perhaps Novak's most memorable performance was reaching out his hand toward President Bush's seat in the audience, sinking hearts across the country.<br>Through his performance, Novak used the field as a stage, bringing Bobby Kennedy to our TVs at home. Shoving his ensemble out of the way as they ran aimlessly through the field during <i>The Phone Is Ringing</i>, Novak showed the terror of the Hughes Affair through his expression that we just don't get during biannual election season broadcasts of the show.<br><br><h4>The Unforgettable Ads</h4>It's become a ritual for some Americans to try and spot each Kennedy family cameo during advertisements. Some advertising firms now go as far as to include the information of the family's agents with a purchase of 30 seconds of ad time in a package deal.<br><br>Last night, astute Kennedy watchers could have achieved a new high score, with different family members appearing in a whopping 16 ads (not including Ford's new Kennedy F250).<br><br>The funniest, which immediately dominated the conversation on Twitter, the everything app, was the sibling banter between Matthew and Joe III in their Sonic ad.<br><br>The most shocking reveal, however, was saved for last. In the final ad break, John Kennedy Jr. made his first public appearance since 1995. After facing trial for dropping out of the 1992 presidential election after a bet with his brother, the President and Democratic nominee, John retreated from public life to protect his sister's career, the then newly appointed Secretary of State Caroline Kennedy (who still holds this position today!)<br><br>While the politically astute debated the ethics of his appearance, the rest of the country was reminded of the first time they were ever charmed by the ever-boyish looks of "John" from State Farm.<br><br>With John emerging from his private life, the lid on the Kennedys' Pandora's Box has opened wide! Many Kennedywatchers are placing bets online on who could appear next, with some eager fans using AI to imagine what ads RFK would be in if he were alive today!</body></span></p></div>`)

It is not even a “good” musical. Still, there is no doubting its power. Even if you haven’t seen it, you probably do recognize the songs “Las Vegas” and “Elusive”. A few years ago, JPMorgan Bank tried selling credit cards with a cover of “Give ‘Em A Show”—a song that’s <i>extremely</i> sarcastic in context. <br><br>The world just can’t get enough of this show and it’s hard to blame them. Aside from its compelling source material—based on the <u style=\"color:#00A3D9\">epic debacle that was the 1972 presidential election</u>—-the show tries to deal with some heady topics related to politics, greed, and our desire to see the best in people who don’t deserve it.<br><br>Or, at least some versions do. Over the years, there’s been no fewer than <u style=\"color:#00A3D9\">12 major staged productions</u> with wildly different interpretations. There’s the original Broadway stage version portraying 1972 as an epic struggle between fantasy and reality. Then there’s the British stage version that tries to turn 1972 into a kind of “epic tragedy”, a moment when “America reverted to its youth” after the traumas of Vietnam and the Kennedy Assassination. Then there’s the American version that treats the material entirely as a personal struggle between two Great Men, where the nation is merely a canvas for them to color. And there’s the Soviet staging that—.<br><br>Aaagh!<br><br>People like the grand ideas. They like the larger-than-life characters, but 50 years after its original premiere, it’s clear that <i>something</i> is missing from this show to help it hold together. Not to sound too much like a LaRouche girl, but it feels like we still don’t know the whole story. Maybe someone should ring up 93-year-old Bobby Kennedy and see what he knows.<br><br>I don’t know. The point of this blog is not to relitigate things (I got flamed enough for <u style=\"color:#00A3D9\">my take</u> on the 2000 election and how the FBI was totally involved in stealing it from poor Jack Jr.). It’s to offer a way forward for the TTNWerewolves to brainstorm a way to fix this musical. <br><br>Below, I’ve created a cute little table compiling all publicly available info on the major productions of TTNW, organized by differences in plot, song changes, and other miscellaneous stuff. I’m thinking if we look at the differences between these different shows, we can figure out what works and what doesn’t. Maybe we could even write our own script given that they’re talking about <u style=\"color:#00A3D9\">reviving it again at the Kennedy Center this year</u>.<br> <br>What do you think?

                <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><h3 style="color:white; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">🔖 Examining the Kennedy Legacy</h3><br>We’re coming up on the 56 year anniversary of the first ascension of Robert F. Kennedy to the oval office. Since then, it’s been almost 14 elections of pure, unfiltered popularism and rejuvenation of the American spirit. It’s important to evaluate the background of Kennedy and how he came to be the true champion of America.<br><br><h3 style="color:white; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Beginnings</h3><br>The start of Kennedy’s career has been poured over more times than I can count. In that, I will give a brief summary; Kennedy worked with McCarthy, repented, and then worked under his brother, became Attorney General, and then became a senator. Blah, blah. This is basic curriculum; you and I have both seen this in school constantly. We move into 1968, then, where Kennedy eked one of his only real close victories in his career against Richard Nixon. After what seemed like a tough first term, however, his major victories began in 1972, with a clean sweep of 538 votes. From there, America seemed to fall in love with the renegade Kennedy. To move onto more interesting times…<br><br><h3 style="color:white; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">The Changing Decades</h3><br>Throughout the 70s and 80s, America went into a state of flux. While he kept a consistent VP through his second term, things became rougher as he appealed for a third. Nevertheless, the states let him. The 538 electoral vote landslide in 1972 sent shockwaves through America, and it had come with clean sweeps of every chamber of congress. Now it came that every politician tried to chain themselves to him, seeking greater rewards. In that, America saw greater unification than ever, even through the tumultuous crises that rocked the country. The 22nd amendment was appealed, and after a third term rocked by stagflation and the oil crises, the Vice President of the past made way for a new name; Robert Redford.<br><br>Redford was different from the political creatures that dominated his term 1 and 2, and 3. An actor, primarily, and a bleeding heart liberal (to a degree). Initially primed as Kennedy’s successor after his fourth term, the prospect faded as Kennedy claimed that ‘his work was not done’, particularly in the time of the booming eighties. <br><br>America returned Kennedy to office in 1980 against a weaker Republican Party, leading into his next term of domestic success and further prosperity after the struggles of the 70s. But Redford retired after one term, citing a want to return to acting and, now, producing. In came Ralph Nader with Kennedy instead; it signalled Kennedy’s want to continue forward with his progressive direction. At least, that was the plan until Nader quickly resigned.<br><br>It’s still unclear what happened in that timespan. But later that year in 1985, Gary Hart was nominated to replace him, now guiding American forward under his newer vision. More than ever, America would be focused on the development of technology, particularly under his more innovative, “Atari” branding from the flaming, cultural liberalism of the Redford years. <br><br>That lasted about three years, until Hart also resigned. The culture was confused, even with Kennedy’s steady hand to guide them along in his now fifth term. <br><br><h3 style="color:white; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">The Sorenson Years</h3><br>In came the longest lasting man yet; Ted Sorenson, to replace Hart after the 1988 election. Under Sorenson and Kennedy, the land boomed for a long, consistent 21 years. Gay marriage was legalized in 2008, despite Kennedy’s gaffes on the congress floor in support (which I cannot repeat here). Sorenson was clearly set up to be Kennedy’s next up, with many expecting Kennedy to either resign or pass away in the 1989-2010 timespan Sorenson served.<br><br>But he just… didn’t. And for the better, too. Kennedy’s strong will, even in his elder years, kept America powering through into the age of Kennedy prosperity. Kennedy, on his part, seemed well enough to continue, talking up that, despite his many years, he still had things to do. There was an America to continue to oversee. And for his part, he continued to be rewarded with more terms. By this point, much of the opposition to his own presidency had faded; the political fight was spent on congress, rather than over him. He was a goliath.<br><br>On Sorenson’s part, he shepherded another twenty years of successful legislation through, seemingly accurately having his ear on public opinion. But it was quiet. So is there much to talk about? No, not really. But that’s fine, in the end. Because it was successful.<br><br>But, eventually, Sorenson died in 2010, having his lords calling earlier than Kennedy did. The office sat vacant for three years, with Kennedy seemingly trying to adjust to the giant gap that Sorenson left in the Vice President’s office.<br><br><h3 style="color:white; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">The New Era</h3><br>But his departure pulled America out of the static place it had been in for so long. It was, then, no shock in 2012 when Kennedy said he was running again. The Vice President was most shocking; this time, it was Melinda Gates, who would now become the first female to ascend to the office. In this, she embraced the culture surrounding abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.<br><br>Things moved as normal for a few years. All was quiet, until Melinda stepped down in 2016. A rumor popped up in the corn field of Kennedy allegedly being “sick and tired” of her ardent liberalism. I find the rumors rather doubtful, after his many, many years of activism. <br><br>But nevertheless, in came another tech executive; Mark Zuckerberg, the head of Linked. Zuckerberg brought things back down to a quiet simmer, rather than the loud activism of VP Gates. It was all business until 2020, when Zuckerberg left to return to the private sector. Again, he was dogged again by a rumor now alleging that Zuckerburg was too much of a “bore” for the elder Kennedy, on top of allegations of improper usage of office. Perhaps Kennedy had his heartbeat on public approval, as he tended to. That left Kamala Harris, the first senator since Gary Hart, to inherit the office.<br><br>Kennedy is now near 100. It is unclear if he intends to stop anytime soon. He has been seen less and less in public since Sorenson’s death. And when he does appear, he does make gaffes; some evidence of this is evident in his DNC appearance in 2020, in which he accidentally called Kamala Harris a word I also can’t repeat, and then seemed visibly confused when he was told that it was not okay for her to be referred to that way anymore.<br><br>But that doesn’t particularly matter, nor has it ever around Kennedy and his often occurring gaffes since 2000. Kennedy is the giant the office always needed; the monolith, the rock of stability even in the roughest times. We don’t need a dictatorship for such things. But it’s become clear that America much prefers his brand of stability for as long as he’ll survive. I can say that, as a collective, the country only wants him to live longer. He will be the model for generations to come; greater than FDR, greater than Teddy, and greater than George. He is the star of the show. And nothing will ever come close to him again.</span>

                <center style="font-size:16px;">New York Times</center><br><h3>Mr. Kennedy Goes to Broadway</h3><br><small>Nov. 10, 2005</small><br><br>Nobody was surprised when it was announced Things That Never Were, one of the most successful Broadway musicals in history, was making a big comeback for its 30th anniversary. A cultural touchstone, the great political thriller and tragedy show was sure to attract a star-studded audience of attendees at its premiere on November 4th. Great actors like Tom Cruise, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Jodie Foster. Power players like Mayor Sharpton and the nominees for Mayor from both parties; Congressman Anthony Weiner and former <i>Frasier</i> star Kelsey Grammer. One man few, if anyone, expected to be there was former President Robert Kennedy.<br><br>Something of a recluse since becoming the first President in American history to lose every state in a campaign (only saved from total oblivion), Kennedy didn’t attend the opening show in 1975, despite multiple invites and attempts to contact him by producers. He has few remarks even acknowledging the show’s existence, having claimed in 1975, before <i><b>Things That Were Never</i></b> became one of the most profitable productions in Broadway history, that it would “likely be a failure” since “nobody wants to watch a political sob story that ends in tragedy.” Kennedy was proven wrong quicker than he could have ever realized. <br><br>In hindsight, it isn’t difficult to see why, after a Greek tragedy and aura of mystery permeated around Kennedy after his historic loss, Things That Never Were became as popular as it was. During its inaugural show in November 1975, hundreds came from all across the nation to watch the sad story of Robert F. Kennedy. His idealism, which critics have called “corrupted” in the show, the rise, presidency, and ultimate fall of a man once considered the most beloved person in the world. Although many said that it told a “fake history” of the events that transpired only a mere month after writing began, for the idea that would become Things That Never Were. <br><br>In his only other public comments on the product, Kennedy claimed in 1995 that he agreed with the criticisms, and others close to the former President say he nearly sued them in 1974, potentially stopping Things That Never Were before it ever took flight. Many have expressed confusion at Kennedy’s distaste for the songs chronicling his life, as most historians agree that it is, overall, biased towards Kennedy and the many stories his aides produced in the immediate years after 1972, but many historians, such as popular conservative columnist Patrick Buchanan say that it distorts his ideology.<br><br>“Bobby Kennedy wasn’t some kind of anti-Cold War hero who supported the gays and wanted to establish some kind of socialist utopia.” Buchanan said in a recent article, “I was around back then. Kennedy, both Jack and Bobby, they were real warriors. Really tough people. You’d never see someone like [President] Bill Bradley going against the radicals in his party.” Buchanan, like others, view Things That Never Were as nothing more than “left wing propaganda” written by “drugged up communists” during the mid 70s. These sentiments, although not the same charged up partisan statements that men like Mr. Buchanan make, are reportedly shared by Kennedy, who was described in ‘<i>Exiled King: The Fall of Bobby Kennedy and the End of Camelot</i>’, as a bitter, bigoted man in his years since leaving the White House. <br><br>All of this is to say that Robert Kennedy’s appearance at a showing of Things That Never Were elicited gasps from those eagle-eyed viewers watching stars enter Broadway for the 30th anniversary show.<br><br>Few people could see the man of the hour in the theater, in a dark corner above the audience, locked away from society. Nobody could speak to him. Those who caught a glimpse of him during the show described his expression as “bored”, “disgusted”, and “miserable”. <br><br>Towards the end of the show, right before the climax with “<i>All Good Things Must Come To An End</i>”, Kennedy and his entourage stormed out of the theater. At first, members of the cast, and those in the audience who saw him leave, were worried he left out of hatred for the show. However, according to a source close to the President, he had a panic attack and could barely stand on his way out of the building.<br><br>“He’s getting up there in age, and he just can’t handle these things the same way, reliving that kind of failure.

                Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen | July 27 2011 transcript</h3><p><span style=\"color:#d6ced6;\">
                Andy Cohen: Finally, Donald Trump has done it all. Produced Tony award winning Broadway musicals, been one of RuPaul’s fiercest celebrity judges on Drag Race [audience cheers], and is even considering…running for office? [gasps] But, Here’s What, is he ready to [audience chanting] Plead the Fifth!?<br><br>Donald Trump: Absolutely.<br><br>C: Donald Trump, I have three questions for you, and you can plead the fifth to only one. Trump, say three nice things about…Patti Lupone, [audience jeers] oh no!<br><br>T: Well she’s a very nasty woman, very nasty. I’m a good friend with Andrew, so-<br><br>C: Andrew Lloyd Webber<br><br>T: Andrew Lloyd, we call him Andrew Lloyd, and what washed up has-been Patti Lupone [audience boos] did to him on Sunset, excuse me, excuse me-<br><br>C: The audience is not liking that answer, but go on.<br><br>T: Thank you, what she did on Sunset, it was a disgrace. A big fat disgrace. If anyone else behaved like that, they would have been kicked the hell off Broadway, it’s true. It’s so true. [tentative applause]<br><br>C: Okay, I haven’t heard one nice thing though [audience laughs].<br><br>T: I promise you, I actually love standing next to her, it’s true, I do. Because she’s one of the people who makes my hair look flattering. [audience laughs and cheers]<br><br>C: Oooo okay-<br><br>T: See this is easy, no fifth, no fifth, not pleading the fifth.<br><br>C: Well let me give you this one then, what is your all-time favorite musical? And you can only pick one.<br><br>T: There’s a lot of them, and I’ve been to a lot of them, believe me. With regard to Cats, we love Cats, but I would say…Things That Never Were [one audience member cheers]<br><br>C: Oh wow, is that the, that-<br><br>T: Kennedy, yeah, it’s the Kennedys. And let me say, frankly, with respect to the Kennedy, they’re all-time, okay? All-time. With Jack and little John-John, that’s what we call him, we call him John-John. Straight out of central casting, we’ve never seen a man like that, better looking even than Tom Cruise. [audience cheers] Better than Tom Cruise. And it’s very sad what happened to John-John, but people come up to me, tears in their eyes and they say “sir, he’s never really gone,” and I say “wow.” So we’re looking into that very very strongly.<br><br>C: Woah, what? You mean-<br><br>T: But Jackie, of course, she’s unbelievable, right? [audience applauds] The greatest of all time. Beautiful woman. I mean what she went through, in the pillbox, the little pink, we love the pillbox by the way, love the pillbox. [tentative applause] But you see all these women, beautiful women, who try that look, and let me tell you, no one does like it her. Okay? Nobody. [audience cheers] And a lot of them tried, believe me. Should I say who? [crowd yells yes] No, no…I won’t say it, I’ll be nice.<br><br>C: Right, haha, but I mean she’s the best, the best there was, but let me ask you a little more about this play, because I don’t think a lot of people know anything about it-<br><br>T: Well they should, they should. It was, okay, it’s about Bobby Kennedy, right? People call him, back there, they all call him [Trump imitating someone] “It’s Robert Kennedy, sir, Robert F. Kennedy,” I say no, no, it’s Bobby. We call him Bobby. [audience applauds]. So it’s about him, with regard to White House, and a lot of birthdays, many many birthdays. He has a song about Vietnam, it’s funny by the way, nobody ever talks about Vietnam. I was telling Ivanka that the other day, remember that? They were chanting in the streets, marching, saying “this is Kennedy’s war,” and I thought wow, we gotta get the hell out of there, and we did. We did. Bobby did it. So that’s what the show is about. You know this right?<br><br>C: Uh, sure [audience laughs]. One last question, since we’re on the political topic, we’ve got a big election coming up next year, okay? And everyone’s talking about how, you know, Michael Kennedy, is he running is he not running. So let me ask you, if he calls you up tomorrow and says ‘Hey Donny baby, do you want to be my veep?” What are you telling him?<br><br>T: I would tell him, Mike, sashay away. [deafening cheers]</span></p></div>`)

                <strong>Plus: Why the left can’t stand ‘Things That Never Were’</strong><br><br><b>T. Swanson McNear Carlson</b><br></i>FEB. 19 2002</i><br><br>First, before we discuss the Broadway revival of <i>Things That Never Were</i>, a few words about the ongoing defensive military operations underway in Venezuela are necessary. While we at <i>The Weekly Standard</i> have made our disagreements with President Hogan clear, as he has intensified his anti-democratic intentions at home, it is hard to truly object to the toppling of a corrupt dictatorship threatening our shores thousands of miles away. The dynastic rule of one of the world’s most rotten autocracies is at an end, and it was the United States that did it. That warrants celebration, no matter how cynical the commencement of these operations by Hogan may be, particularly to distract from his impeachment saga and his sex tape scandal.<br><br>But that is precisely why the left is outraged over <i>Things That Never Were</i>, the musical reimagining of the Vietnam War and the second Kennedy presidency. Just ask anti-American radical Susan Sarandon, who told Entertainment Weekly that “it’s all fiction, just propagandistic garbage.” She would know a thing or two about that, with her treasonous support for Central American peasants the U.S. rightfully slaughtered. But you can’t expect Hollywood liberals to understand what <i>Real</i> America wants. And as I waited for the curtain call sitting inside the Ambassador Theatre, I looked around the room, seeing everything the anti-American left hates: good white Christian men who have come with their families from the heartland, to see their president rightfully represented as a man wronged by his own allies. Like Caesar, Robert Kennedy was surrounded by enemies.<br><br>While bowled over by the musicality and craft of the production (the breathwork Bebe Neuwirth demonstrates, my <i>God</i>), I couldn’t help but fixate on a different element, and that was how the production reveals the truth of those Kennedy years. In the marketing for <i>Things That Never Were</i>, the play has been referred to as a “reimagining” of the presidency, but respectfully, I think that’s entirely wrong. It does not create anything new out of whole cloth, but rather shows us what we always suspected, what we always <i>felt</i>, but could never put our finger on. That very thing is what led millions of us to believe that something had gone awry. That the American story as we knew it had taken a wrong turn somewhere around Saigon.<br><br>In this new revival of the classic 1970s production, Robert Kennedy is a man who lured the feeble-minded New Left youths to support his campaign in ‘68, since they still constituted a necessary component of the Democratic coalition. Once in office, he believed he could swat them aside and successfully pursue the Twilight Struggle against the Soviets, as he urged his brother to do in Cuba. But by allowing a parasite into the White House, it consumed him, jamming knives into his back, and having these traitorous filth abandon our brave soldiers in the line of fire. Once Saigon collapsed, the boat people fled, and our last helicopters took off, Kennedy was confronted with the magnitude of his own actions. As imagined in the musical, he told McNamara, “Oh God. What have I done?”<br><br>Yet the American people put their faith in him. One. More. Time. <br><br>The men of the heartland understood what their president had fought for. They trusted his leadership at a time of crisis. They remembered the Bobby Kennedy of their youth. The man who wasn’t content with staring down the Soviets over missiles in Havana, but wanted to nuke them. The man who was unsatisfied with sending advisors to South Vietnam, and wanted to nuke them. The man who was infuriated at Johnson’s inaction during the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, and wanted to nuke them too. That man is who I saw on stage last night, and he is someone I would not hesitate to vote for in this climate.<br><br>I implore all readers to see this production as soon as you can. It’s not only technically brilliant, but a political revelation, and will change how you have seen the last 30 years of our history. Godspeed to our Marines in Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Kosovo, Colombia, Iraq, Iran, Georgia, Chechnya, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, and Judea and Samaria.</span></p></div>`)

Wall Street Insurgents were thrown out of their tents, dozens were arrested, and the entire atmosphere of the insurgency had changed forever. It marked the four-month anniversary of Insurgency Wall Street, when the 99% finally began fighting back against the 1%, just as the indigenous people’s liberation armies across Latin America and Africa continue to do as we speak. Much has been written about this sickening sweep by NYPD’s fascist thugs, and all of it is necessary reading, yet one aspect elided much of this coverage, and that was the outdoor performance of <i>Things That Never Were</i>.<br><br>A forgotten Broadway musical from 1976, <i>Things That Never Were</i> adapts the crises of capitalism in the early 1970s, set against the backdrop of the second Kennedy presidency, featuring lively scenes of the fascist imperialist war on Vietnam, the FBI’s repression of the Black freedom movement, and of course the economic collapse of 1972, in which millions lost their jobs and homes. This era is crucial to study for any member of the 99%, as we hurtle towards a repeat, with our failing oil wars in Venezuela, Colombia, and Angola coinciding with a capitalist system pushed to the breaking point. Whether it will be revolution or repetition is another story.<br><br>The musical examines exactly how the ruling class wormed their way out of such crises, polarizing the working class along issues of race or gender, dividing and conquering. To the detriment of the people, it worked, with the following decades dominated by culture war politics, ignoring the rich fleecing the rest of the nation once again. Something to keep in mind when politicians like Buddy Roemer try to dismiss this people’s movement as “just a bunch of queers.”<br><br>Of course few saw <i>Things That Never Were</i> so clearly at the time. Its satirical elements and lampooning of the capitalist ruling class were met with confusion by middle-brow Broadway critics, and with minimal foot traffic, the ambitious production closed shortly after its opening. But the past few months has seen a reclamation of this story, both online and on the ground, with frequent revival shows performed in the park, sometimes by stage actors quitting their typical jobs to come join the rest of the 99%. <br><br>We hardly expect all of the working class to appreciate this stage play’s greater meaning, nor should we neglect the important work our insurgency movement is doing in other respects, but <i>Things That Never Were</i> helps encapsulate how fleeting these moments can be. We must not miss this opportunity again. There are few moments in history where as many crises have coalesced to provide the ground for a revolution, but this is one of those times. As the progressive Senator Robert Byrd memorably tells Patrick Moynihan: “even if it takes another hundred years, mark my words, we shall rise again.”<br><br>Us insurgents must take heart in Mayor Jim Cramer’s recent prediction at a press conference, declaring that if our movement continues to pick up speed, “nobody’s stopping them, and it’ll be our heads in the street.” Cramer couldn’t be more right. Maybe he would have learned why if he he had watched <i>Things That Never Were</i>.<br><br><b>EDITORS NOTE</b>: This article was published on November 28, covering the police raid on the 22nd, which failed to shut down Insurgency Wall Street. However, on November 29, a much larger NYPD raid combined with FBI agents on the ground dragged away thousands of insurgents and successfully killed the movement.</span></span></p></div>`)

His advisors give him contradictory advice, intent on making him a vehicle for their own goals. As the nation roils, the president wrestles with his demons and tries to figure out what kind of leader he wants to be.<br><br>Believe it or not, this isn’t a summary of television’s latest political thriller, but of a rare musical, being performed for the first time in decades by Chaney High School Students, on Fridays and Saturdays from March 12 to April 13.<br><br>“Things That Never Were” is a musical that takes place against the backdrop of the presidency of Robert F. Kennedy. Set in the days before cell phones and national insurance cards -- when the “Good Old Boys” of the ex-Confederacy still had their foot on the throat of most Americans, the musical depicts the 37th president as he struggles to secure re-election. <br><br>Along the way, he has to contend with a variety of enemies trying to thwart his ambitions -- from the predatory Robert Byrd (Senator of West Virginia, 1959 - 2001) to the corrupt J. Edgar Hoover (Director of the FBI, 1935-1971) to the deceptively friendly D.P. Moynihan (presidential advisor and later President of New York University). All of them have their own interests. <br><br>A musical about a popular, then-sitting president seems like something that would catch public attention but not so.<br><br>When it was staged off-Broadway in 1975, the production was a bomb, ending after fewer than 20 performances and a slew of bad reviews. Few of the performers ever returned to the stage afterward. <i>Vindicator</i> reporters could only find one other production in the last 50 years -- staged at the Belmont Community Theater in York, Pennsylvania in 1997. <br><br>The entire musical might have been forgotten after that, had drama teacher Harry Niles not discovered an old script during school renovations this summer.<br><br>“This was the best impulsive decision I ever made,” said Niles. “This show is magic with this group of kids.”<br><br>He explained that the show was not the original choice for the Spring musical, but he was encouraged to pursue it by his fellow teachers union members who felt that it would be a great way to combine student interests in history, theater, and politics.<br><br>Torrey Moshfegh, a CHS senior who is playing Ethel Kennedy, told <i>Vindicator</i> reporters that students in his drama club didn’t believe Niles when he told them they were producing “Things That Never Were”.<br><br>“He told us we were doing this weird, political musical instead of <i>Annie</i>, and, at first, we were all like ‘<i>Whaaaaat?</i>’ Then we started reading the script and the whole atmosphere changed. It was like the characters were in the room with us.”<br><br>Niles said all his students showed immense professionalism. He was heartened by how students engaged with the material and asked questions about the topics it raised.<br><br>“Before doing this, I don’t know if I thought much about Robert Kennedy because he died in a plane crash in like 1981, decades before I was born,” said Mohammad Osman, a CHS Senior playing Bobby Kennedy. “I started doing a lot of research into him as we were doing rehearsals and I learned a lot.”<br><br>“Obviously, he made a lot of mistakes and said stuff I don’t agree with. I think his attitudes on Palestine and gay people were kind of bad. Still, you know, there’s stuff to learn there. He wasn’t perfect, but he tried his hardest. He helped a lot of people. I have friends who still rely on the FAP so it was cool learning where that came from.”<br><br>Laura McDaniel, CHS history teacher, says she was excited about “Things That Never Were” from the very beginning.<br><br>“I knew even before auditions that we were going to have a great cast. The kids of this generation are just wonderful. They’re so active and involved,” said McDaniel.<br><br>She explained how she was so excited by the final product that she reached out to the John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy Presidential Libraries and offered to send them a recording that they can use for their collections. While neither has responded to her request, she said she remained hopeful.<br><br>“Even if they’re no longer the center of the political universe and the family is out of politics, John and Robert Kennedy are well-regarded by historians and have done a lot to foster the next generation of leaders. I hope they can support the Youngstown community by elevating these kids.”<br><br>Still, many of the high school students say they’re happy with what they’ve made -- even if it doesn’t get their names in lights at the Kennedy Center.<br><br>“I take pride in it. I think we did a good job and it shows that we’re able to challenge ourselves and grow,” said Joshua Stein, drama club student playing Robert Byrd. “I’m hoping I improved my public speaking enough to make a real difference in the Tillman presidential campaign this year.”<br><br>“Things That Never Were” will have its last show on Saturday, April 13th. Tickets are available for purchase for $5 on the school website and support the Chaney theater program. All funds will be matched by the Federal Arts and Cultural Heritage Fund.</p></div></div><p></p><p></p></div></span></p></div>`)

                <b>By E.L. Hall</b><br>September 1975<br><br>There is something unnerving about reading a man’s thoughts, particularly when those thoughts belong to Richard Nixon. They do not unfold the way one might expect from a politician in disgrace. They are not self-pitying, nor are they self-justifying. They are, instead, restless, unfiled, sprawling across decades like evidence gathered in an abandoned case. Some of them are brilliant. Some are mundane. Some are so odd that one wonders whether they were meant to be read at all. And yet, here they are, bound together in a book that has become a sensation: <i>The Private Notes of Richard Nixon</i>.<br><br>A year ago, his name was an epithet in the similar vein of Burr, Harding, those who sought power but were struck down because they were seen. He was a man who had clawed his way up from nothing, reached for the presidency three times, and had it wrenched from his grasp each time, not by conspiracy or calamity, but by the mundane sin of embezzlement. The case against him was a bureaucratic wreck, millions of dollars of campaign funds moved through personal accounts, a labyrinth of unreported loans, a web of finance so tangled that even seasoned prosecutors struggled to track it. He denied, then delayed, then litigated, until even his closest allies abandoned him. He was found guilty before the judge could issue a final sentence. He lives now in San Clemente, barely leaving his estate, awaiting an appeal that may never come.<br><br>Yet somehow, his writings have made their way into public hands.<br><br>The origins of <i>The Private Notes of Richard Nixon</i> are still a matter of legal dispute, but the basic story is as follows: In the spring of this year, a former aide, some say a ghostwriter, others a secretary, began shopping around a collection of Nixon’s private dictations and handwritten notes to major publishers. Initially, there was little interest. Nixon, after all, was still alive, still litigious, and still, in the eyes of the publishing industry, radioactive. But then the excerpts leaked. A small literary journal printed a handful of passages, the ones about the dog for example. They were reprinted in newspapers. They made the rounds in New York and Washington. Suddenly, the man America had dismissed as a crook and a bore was being reconsidered as something else entirely: fascinating.<br><br>By June, multiple publishing houses were engaged in a quiet but aggressive bidding war for the manuscript. Nixon’s legal team, predictably, threatened to block its release. But the provenance of the documents was murky, many had been dictated to aides, left in files, jotted into government notebooks that technically belonged to no one. And more than a few seemed to have been intentionally discarded, as though Nixon himself had lost track of them, or no longer cared. Ultimately, a deal was struck. The book would be published, and Nixon, facing mounting legal fees and dwindling options, would not contest it.<br><br>They are, like the man himself, impossible to categorize. Some passages are eerily lucid, statesmanlike even. Others spiral into something far more unplaceable. Paranoiac, deeply lonely, almost mystical in their detachment from reality. And some, inexplicably, are charming, as if dictated by an entirely different man.<br><br>The notes, culled from decades of private dictations, scrawled annotations, and half-written letters, span the length of Nixon’s life, but it is the later years that have gripped the public most, his thoughts recorded as he faced trial, the collapse of his empire imminent.<br><br><i><b>September 14, 1973 – San Clemente</b><br>I saw a woman at the grocery store today with a face so familiar I nearly called out to her. Then I realized. She looked like my mother, if my mother had lived a little longer, if she had eaten better, if she had worn jewelry. I followed her for several aisles before realizing she was nobody at all. I left without buying anything.<br><br><b>November 12, 1973 – San Clemente</b><br>The dog understands me. He waits at the door when I come back from my walks. He sighs when I sigh. He knows. People say dogs cannot read human minds but that is a lie.<br><br><b>February 18, 1974 – Sacramento</b><br>Three times. Three times I faced a Kennedy and three times I lost. Jack, I understood. But Bobby? Twice to Bobby? This is a cruel joke. I was smarter. I was more prepared. I had read every book that man never touched. What did he know?<br><br><b>February 19, 1974 – Sacramento (margin note)</b><br>(Perhaps I was never meant to know.)<br><br><b>March 8, 1974 – Sacramento County Courthouse</b><br>Men have survived worse trials than this. Cicero was exiled. Napoleon was humiliated, then crowned again. Christ was crucified. I suspect I am somewhere in that range.<br><br><b>March 9, 1974 – Sacramento County Courthouse (margin note)</b><br>(Delete Christ. Keep Napoleon.)<br><br><b>June 12, 1974 – San Clemente</b><br>I have been watching the seagulls on the beach. It occurs to me that they are the perfect birds. Industrious, resourceful, unliked. No one chooses the seagull, but the seagull persists. One could do worse than to be a seagull.<br><br><b>June 14, 1974 – San Clemente (margin note)</b><br>Perhaps I should have been a seagull.<br><br><b>August 2, 1974 – Sacramento County Courthouse</b><br>There is no history of great men in California. Not real history, not lasting history. This place erases the powerful because it was built for no one. I used to think I would leave my mark here, that I would carve something into the stone. But it is all sand. And when I leave, the wind will take me too.</i><br><br>It is this oscillation between hubris, self-pity, mundane observation, and startling clarity, that has caught the public imagination. The book is less a memoir than a self-diagnosis, written in real time. Even those who despised Nixon cannot deny its pull. He is no longer just a villain. He is something rarer: a man rendered fully, boldly human in his own hand.<br><br>The book’s reception has been more than academic. With the success of <i>Things That Never Were</i> and the new wave of political tragedy dominating the American stage, Nixon, once considered too caustic, too pedestrian for true drama, is suddenly being spoken of in theatrical terms. His life, once a punchline, has been reframed as something grander, sadder, and infinitely more profitable.<br><br>It is only natural that the playwrights are circling. Rumors abound that several major figures, some say Arthur Miller, others whisper Robert Bolt, are considering a Nixonian tragedy for the stage. It is easy to see the appeal. A man who spent his life just outside the gates of history, always a step behind, always reaching, never quite belonging. A man who sees himself as the last guardian of an America that did not want him. A man who, when his moment finally came, could not help but destroy himself.<br><br>Somewhere in the halls of Broadway, someone is drafting monologues for an actor who will stand in low light and pace in clipped, haunted tones. <i>Richard Nixon, the last tragic American</i>.<br><br>There is already speculation about who might play him. Some suggest George C. Scott, others Peter Finch. Some say it must be a younger man, one who can capture the desperation of the earlier years, the raw need to <i>be</i> someone. Perhaps the play will open in Sacramento, at the trial, Nixon looking back, trying to explain. Perhaps it will end in San Clemente, alone, watching the seagulls.<br><br>Nixon will never be absolved. There are still those who remember the rallies, the fraud, the ruined lives. There are still those who will see this book as an indulgence, a rebranding of a man who spent his entire career cutting corners and claiming he was simply misunderstood.<br><br>But history is not in the business of fairness. The villains, eventually, are given their audience. The men who seemed unworthy of tragedy are, one day, reclaimed as tragic. And Richard Nixon, in his final political act, has finally secured a place in the American canon. Not as what he wanted, but as something almost Shakespearean.<br><br>A man forever standing outside the great hall, waiting to be let in.</span></p></div>`)

In just the span of a few weeks, websites from America’s Google Giggles to South Africa’s X have been awash with works of art and pieces of fiction about the powerful men in the show.

Set in the runup to the famously uncompetitive 1976 presidential election, the show centers on the efforts of then-Vice President Robert Byrd and then-Representative Phillip Burton to find a suitable candidate for the Democratic nomination. For our younger readers, what made this process so important was that VP Byrd was considered a lock to be the Democratic nominee in 1976. His decision to sit out the race and go back to the Senate was set to be a major shock, and his clout within the party meant that whoever he decided to back was set to have a major advantage. And at the same time all of this was happening, the ailing Republican Party was in the process of being replaced with the Taxpayer’s Party, resulting in a split opposition vote and a substantial advantage for the Democrats in the electoral college.<br><br>It wouldn’t be wrong to say that Byrd and Burton had the future of the country in their hands at that moment, and, indeed, it is that exact idea that <i>Matchmaker!</i> picks up and runs with. From Robert’s striking introduction of himself in the opening (“Sweeping Up Scraps”) to his duet with Burton to close Act I (“Two’s Company”), it’s made abundantly clear that the whims of two men are dictating the course of the world’s largest democracy—and that their whims are often quite fickle. This is the crux of the show’s humor, whether it involves the feckless Sen. Edmund Muskie tanking his chances by referring to Byrd with the wrong nickname (“It’s Robert, Not Bob”) or Rep. Barbara Jordan unexpectedly bonding with the VP over their shared love of the constitution (“Our Little Fixations”). Even if you’re the stodgiest student of history in the country, it can be hard not to laugh while watching such an important process play out like Hello, Dolly!, which Matchmaker! is often compared to.<br><br>But even more than the laughs—and there are many—the emotional core of the story shines through with the relationship between Byrd and Burton. As you likely already know, Burton himself ends up being the one who Byrd selects to lead the ticket, a product of Burton’s intentional strategy to use his position as Byrd’s matchmaker to learn the VP’s wants and desires. He ends up figuring out that the Veep’s primary concern isn’t policy or personal relations, but whether he can get his old desk back when he returns to the Senate (“Good Old Stonewall”). Burton makes this promise to him (“Senior Again”), and the rest is history. Burton gets the White House, Byrd gets his office, and the two go on to have a productive legislative partnership. This is the one element that both longtime fans and new viewers alike have responded to the most, with many even making their own pieces of art and literature about real and imagined “Byrdton” relationships.<br><br>For all of its successes, however, there’s something that those advertising the recording haven’t gotten quite right. While Enron+ has been fond of advertising the historical musical as “one of a kind,” that’s not exactly true—and we’re not just referring to Lin-Manuel Miranda’s panned 2015 production about the life and times of Andrew Jackson. After weeks of investigation, our team found another history-based musical from the 70’s that also had Robert Byrd himself as part of the cast. That was 1976’s <i>Things That Never Were</i>, a short-lived production about President Robert Kennedy’s first term. <br><br>The show's screenplay reads as something of a time-capsule of old liberal sensibilities. Instead of the endearingly quirky statesman he is in <i>Matchmaker!</i>, the Robert Byrd of <i>Things That Never Were</i> is nothing less than dangerous. In the world of the earlier play, Byrd uses Kennedy’s desire for a legislative legacy for his own ends, pushing through a reactionary social agenda while taking credit for liberal ideas that actually originate from the White House. In the Election Night finale, the new VP-elect is described as practically towering over Kennedy in the Oval Office, with the implication that it will soon become his own. Then, right before the curtains fall, the stage is set to depict a White House with a burning cross in front of it, a clear sign of how the writers felt about this seemingly-impending new political order.<br><br>It’s all quite different compared to <i>Matchmaker!</i>, to say the least. Even still, it’s easy to wonder why one of these 70s political dramas completely failed to launch while the other is rumored to get a film adaptation after the pandemic. The most obvious answer was that it was poor predictions—and bad timing—on the part of <i>Things That Never Were</i>. Not only was it written around the idea of a future Byrd presidential run, but it actually hit theaters that same dramatic week that Byrd announced he wasn’t running for president. It was also centered around a Kennedy during a time of flagging public interest in the family, although the then-President did his best to remedy that. In fact, our investigation showed that <i>Things That Never Were</i> was actually the show Kennedy went to see during his widely panned “Culture Tour” to Manhattan during his final year as president. Although the visit did reportedly drive substantial interest in the show, most of those who wished to see it after Kennedy’s attendance couldn’t afford tickets, so his effort ultimately did little to extend its longevity.<br><br>These are all valid explanations, but they don’t capture the full story about the relationship between the two plays. In our investigation of <i>Things That Never Were</i>, we discovered that its legacy still lives on among a set of intensely devoted <i>Matchmaker!</i> fans who have spent years brigading practically any mention of the ill-fated show on social media. Although they are hostile in all of their interactions outside of their community, they are especially vitriolic to suggestions that <i>Matchmaker!</i> was inspired by <i>Things That Never Were</i> in any way—especially if such suggestions speak negatively of Byrd. In one especially infamous incident, a PhD student who suggested that Byrd’s role in <i>Matchmaker!</i> was derived from Rogers Morton in <i>Things That Never Were</i> faced months of harassment and was forced to hire private security.<br><br>This has greatly confused the team who first created <i>Matchmaker!</i>, all of whom eagerly acknowledged the influence of <i>Things That Never Were</i> had on their project when we spoke to them. Speaking anonymously for his personal safety, one writer said that he had always regarded <i>Matchmaker!</i> as something of a spiritual successor of <i>Things That Never Were</i>, and that many major decisions—like the absence of Kennedy—were intended as continuations of themes in the earlier work.  While acknowledging the substantial differences in tone, he said he found it shocking that so many saw <i>Things That Never Were</i> as antithetical to his work. “That show was all about how Kennedy ended up building the legacies of others instead of his own,” he said. “Ours was about what happened after that. It got absurd! That’s where the humor is supposed to come from. People get that. Right?”<br><br>It was hard to answer his question affirmatively, especially when our interview came right after U.S. House Speaker Harold Ford compared himself to Byrd in a speech meant to advertise himself as a candidate in the Democrats’ upcoming contested convention this summer. Although Robert Byrd may have never burned a cross on the White House lawn or ever entered it as president, it’s undeniable that his legacy still lives on long after his death. In fact, it is arguably more relevant than the legacy of the still-living Robert Kennedy in spite of the ex-president’s recent attempts to re-enter the cultural fray (you can read about his recent self-recording of “Imagine” <a>at the link here</a>). <br><br>For better or worse, it appears that the efforts of the producers of <i>Matchmaker!</i> to build on the central critique of <i>Things That Never Were</i> failed. Not only are fans failing to recognize the main points that the hit musical makes, but they appear to like it because of a portrayal of Byrd that they perceive as positive. One may hope that this will change, but when the most popular recent piece of writing about the show is a romance between a vampiric Byrd and a female “Philippe Burton,” it’s hard to say that any deeper understanding is set to emerge any time soon.<br><br><i>Editor’s note: the bylines of the reporters who worked on this piece have been removed for their safety.</i></span></p></div>`)

                Theater Review: Lin-Manuel Miranda’s <i>Byrd</i> is Fresher Than the Hills</h3><p><span style=\"color:#d6ced6;\">
                <span style="background-color: #00BCF1; font-size: 16px; color:#FFFFFF;"><b> VULTURE </b></span><br>By <b>Jeff Lee</b><br><br>“How does a fiddler, Klansman, orphaned by influenza, dropped in the middle of a forgotten spot in Appalachia in coalfields, welding ship with the miners, grow up to be a whip and Senator?”<br><br>With that opening line, theatergoers—like Robert Byrd himself—are dropped in the middle of unknown territory. <i>In the Heights</i> creator Lin-Manuel Miranda’s hip-hop-infused biographical musical of one of the most important men in American history is as audacious of norms and rules as Byrd was a master of them. This conflict is not just meta-text, but it is written inside the show’s DNA, with music swinging constantly from Sondheim-esque classics to Public Enemy-inspired beatboxing competitions. <br><br>Embracing rigid formalism, utilizing your own limitations as a weapon to break barriers is the story of Byrd’s entire life, and in a way, the entire American experiment. If you dislike this musical, I have to conclude you just don’t like democracy. More than just a long-winded lecture—as Byrd was oft to give—Miranda’s musical is layered with thematic complexity and features some truly stunning stagework, with American soldiers in the Sudan War rendered as a Roman legion, and President Weicker a late-era emperor. But more than any of that, it’s just a blast.<br><br>It may not be a transformational approach, this isn’t going to revolutionize musical theater, but it is a thoroughly entertaining, at points astonishing, dive into a man’s life. For the historians in the crowd who have read David McCullough’s 900-page tome on Byrd’s career, they will surely spot a number of easter eggs that the rest of us have missed, such as a reference in the second act to an incident where a member of Congress was carried feet-first out of the Senate chambers, as a result of Byrd’s encyclopedic knowledge of the rules. I was told later that indeed this had actually happened, another feather in Miranda’s expanding cap. <br><br>The picture of Byrd that Miranda is painting is enormous, dwarfing the small man’s actual physical imposition, winding from his mother’s death in the 1917 Spanish Flu outbreak and his father giving him away, to his wartime service welding ships for the Allies, to a truly mind-melding cross-burning sequence from his time in the Klan. All of it is rendered at a stunning scale, to match the man’s accomplishments, perhaps none moreso than the feud with Vice President Long that nearly tore apart Robert F. Kennedy’s administration. Here, Long, played brilliantly by Daveed Diggs, challenges Byrd to a fiddle duel, an outrageously entertaining sequence in which Miranda’s Byrd ultimately triumphs, knocking the Louisiana Senator off the Democratic ticket in the 1972 election.<br><br>His subsequent time as Vice President is rushed in the second act, something historians will no doubt quibble with, along with Miranda all but excising his doomed first presidential campaign. But what it creates more space for is his role as leader of an informal resistance during Elmo Zumwalt’s presidency. An admiral, portrayed here by Brian d'Arcy James in a hilarious turn, Zumwalt was utterly clueless of congressional procedures, leaving Byrd to pick up the Democratic Party’s mantle and play him, well, like a fiddle. A hat-tip to Biggie Smalls during a showdown over a reconciliation package is one of the show’s true highlights, which is saying something, considering there’s still a good 30 minutes left of his career in the Senate during six successive presidential administrations.<br><br>To many this will all seem novel to the point of sacrilege. A musical mixing arcane parliamentary procedures with hip-hop? But Broadway and politics often mix, none more thrilling than Patti LuPone’s turn in <i>Lucía</i>, with her 1989 Tony’s performance of <i>Don’t Cry For Me Chile</i> an irreplaceable all-time classic. Think too of <i>Ten Days</i>, with Lenin’s operatic solo, overshadowing John Reed’s personal foibles, no matter how fully committed Hugh Jackman was to the part in 2012’s film adaptation. <br><br>Even Bobby Kennedy has had a musical to his name, with the underappreciated <i>Things That Never Were</i>, the failed Broadway experiment that perhaps came too early, but that nobody has wanted to touch until now. Miranda himself has shied away from any influence on <i>Byrd</i> in interviews, saying he took it all entirely from the McCullough book, but anyone familiar with <i>Things That Never Were</i>—and its online cult following—will be able to spot its impact from a mile away. While Byrd is a hero in his titular play and a scheming nemesis in the 1970’s production, Vietnam is treated in both as an unfortunate thorn in the president’s side, not the generation-defining catastrophe that it was. Historical comparisons aside, <i>Things That Never Were</i> stands out as a complete misfire compared to <i>Byrd</i>, with Miranda lapping the original’s quality with ease.<br><br>Miranda wisely peppers comic relief throughout <i>Byrd</i> too, self-evidently wary that he may be careening into a history lesson, leaving J. Edgar Hoover to be played by Jonathan Groff, who has some truly gut-busting moments I won’t spoil. Some of the plays finest scenes involve Groff appearing in full drag. But Groff is allowed one true ballad, rendered in a very Cher way, to say the least, about cracking down on the Black Panthers, anti-American protesters, and other subversives.<br><br>These scenes unfortunately are what many armchair experts on social media have taken issue with. A number of loud activists, who hardly represent the groups they claim to, have accused Miranda of whitewashing history and outright racism. To those I say: watch Miranda throw off his white robe and hood and launch into a show tune inspired by T-Pain and tell me with a straight face <i>Byrd</i> is laundering white supremacy. The multiracial casting is a masterstroke by Miranda, not at all a cynical excuse to deflect criticism, but a deep commitment to a colorblind America, one in which we can only hope our politicians take notice of. Though Arkansas Governor Hillary Rodham’s attendance last week certainly gives one reason to believe that even years removed from his death, the influence of Cornelius Calvin Sale Jr still echoes in the halls of power.</span></p></div>`)

                <center>Members of the community tell <i>Rolling Stone</i> that the lyrics prove what has long been considered a conspiracy theory<br><br><b>BY RV JONES</b><br>February 16, 2016</center><br><br>When <b><u>Taylor Swift</b></u> released her long-awaited album <b><u>Karma</b></u> this January, her fans eagerly poured over the tracks. The pop star sensation is legendary for hiding cryptic clues about her personal life in her songs, music videos, and album art. But for “Swiftboaters”, a dedicated niche of Swift’s fanbase that’s existed for the last four years, the concern goes beyond tabloid obsessiveness. They think they’re saving a life.<br><br>For those not extremely online, “Swiftboater” is an <b><u>unproven theory</b></u> that Taylor Swift is being coerced into dating US Representative <b><u>Conor Kennedy</b></u>. Its supporters allege this dark conspiracy has been spearheaded by aides of deceased president <b><u>Robert F. Kennedy</b></u> to advance his family’s political prospects. More than that, Swiftboaters believe Swift has been hiding clues in her songs with the hope that someone might rescue her. Some online posters allege that other celebrities—including <b><u>Cheryl Hines</b></u>, <b><u>Emma Stone</b></u>, and <b><u>Arnold Schwarzenagger</b></u> are being similarly threatened.<br><br>All of this emerges, comedically, from the blogging site <b><u>Tumblr in the mid-2010s</b></u>. After an anonymous user posted an <b><u>illegal recording</b></u> of the 2010 off-Broadway revival of <i>Things That Never Were</i>—a Broadway revival depicting the shady dealings of President Robert F. Kennedy—users began speculating about what other dealings the Kennedy family has been involved in since his tumultuous presidency.<br><br>“I think the songs are a call-out,” says 27-year-old Swiftboater Ottessa. “I mean, you look at everything that’s been going on with them. Taylor was a wake-up call, but this stuff has been going on for decades or more. The Pro-Cons [those who support Taylor’s relationship with Conor Kennedy] act like this is crazy but it’s not. I mean, the guy probably stole his brother’s brain.”<br><br>Is Taylor Swift trying to tell the American public that President Robert F. Kennedy stole his brother’s brain (and perhaps ate it, with fava beans and a nice chianti)? Undoubtedly, the internationally beloved artist has an <b><u>unusually close relationship</b></u> with her fans. She has, in the past, encouraged listeners to decipher coded messages in her work. But Swift has also expressed discomfort with the extreme lengths that some fans go to dissect her personal life. Anna, a 26-year-old Swiftboater, said that while her latest release of songs went a long way in “proving” the theory, it was important for fans to respect boundaries.<br><br>“I think it’s clear, at a minimum, she feels suffocated. There was a story, I think two or three years ago, about how Conor made her perform <i>Starlight</i> for Bobby and Ethel where she was clearly uncomfortable. That said, I know some people online who have talked about staking out the Kennedy Compound or, like, posted about going in, guns blazing. Some of that is obviously online frustration that will never go anywhere, but it worries me. I think the support Taylor needs is emotional, not an armed militia.”<br><br>Of the 30 Swiftboater fans who spoke to <i>Rolling Stone</i>, almost all said that Karma (which includes lines about “starlight vanishing into twilight” and complaints about how “life’s not fair”) contained clear nods to their work and the Broadway musical that first inspired them. Still, many felt that the outlandishness of the situation—and the problems of going after the family of two <b><u>fairly respected presidents</b></u>—-made it impossible for them to ever get mainstream acceptance.<br><br><hr><b>RELATED</b><hr><br>Will Kennedy Presidential Ambitions Force Taylor Off Tour?<hr><br>Here's Where Swifties Can Buy Every Version of Karma Online, From Vinyl to Cassette<hr><br>Swift Fans Dissect Pictures of “Distressed” Taylor After Conor Kennedy Proposal<hr><br><br><br>“These people have all the power and influence and their agents are everywhere.

You’ll never see anyone in the mainstream press report on it. So we have to raise awareness with what we have.”<br><br>The Twitter account @swiftboattracker, with over 15,000 followers and tracks the locations of America’s “first couple” believes this is the first step toward progress on larger issues.<br><br>“Look, I don’t know if ‘Karma’ was meant to raise awareness of the injustices that took place in Vietnam through the 60s and 70s, but it’s starting a conversation. I don’t think most people had heard of Sơn Mỹ before they started following discourse around the album,” the account owner says. “Swiftboating is about waking up to the million ways our country has lied to us and pushing against the consensus.”<br><br><hr><br><b>TRENDING</b><hr><br>1.

                By <b>Thomas Winchell</b><br>March 10 1994 Issue<br><br>It begins, as all great tragedies do, in the Oval Office. The curtains are drawn. A storm rages outside. <i>Richard F. Kennington, the last real President, the only man who ever suffered</i>, stands at his desk in a state of anguish and contemplation, his hands clenched, his jaw rigid. Behind him, <i>Wesley Tolliver</i>, the milk-fed Appalachian choirboy, watches in helpless admiration.<br><br>This is Gore Vidal’s <i>Things That Never Were</i> (<i>Ciò che mai fù</i>), an Italian-made retelling of an obscure 70s musical about President Kennedy and the 1972 election. In Vidal’s version however, it is a following of a sulking, brooding manchild making his ascension to the presidency only to prove himself the worst of his brothers, a snarling martinet with a messianic complex, a tin-pot Napoleon in a St. Sebastian costume. His vice president, the drawling, Bible-clutching southerner, is the reluctant object of Kennington’s obsessive, tortured, Catholic guilt-ridden lust and his <i>droit du seigneur</i>. <br><br>It must be said that the protagonist, “Richard F. Kennington,” is a wisp of a disguise, as convincing as a mustache drawn on with kohl. Here is Robert F. Kennedy, or more succinctly, Robert F. Kennedy of Vidal’s nightmares. A priggish autocrat, a monastic brute, a man who punishes and repents in equal measure, one moment ranting about moral decay and the next gripping Tolliver’s arms so firmly it hurts him. That Vice President — Wesley Tolliver — is Robert Byrd in all but name, but Vidal reimagines him less as a segregationist and more as a doomed, reluctant beloved, a southern Patroclus caught in the long shadow of Kennington’s Achilles.<br>Vidal, of course, cannot resist the temptation to insert his usual hobbyhorses. Kennington's court is a mess of fallen angels and opportunists, a White House turned bathhouse, where the Lincoln Bedroom has seen more betrayals than the Senate floor. In Vidal's hands, history becomes a sordid chamber drama, and one cannot shake the feeling that he is less interested in politics than in the aesthetics of a toppled empire.<br>By the second act, the play has descended into something between a constitutional crisis and a bodice ripper. Kennington broods over Tolliver like a 19th-century governess, haunted by feelings he cannot name. He is forever catching his reflection in the Oval Office windows, pacing in monologues so Byzantine they require footnotes, lamenting the burden of power and the temptations of flesh, demanding loyalty while gripping Tolliver by the chin. In another scene, he drunkenly laments Tolliver “will never understand” him before slamming a fist against the Resolute Desk and weeping into a tumbler of Cutty Sark.<br>The third act is Kennington, fully absorbed into his own megalomania, unveiling a sweeping vision of America’s moral purification, an executive order to end all executive orders. “No republic survives without discipline!” he roars, his hands balled into fists, his hair damp with messianic fervor. Tolliver, in a final, trembling confrontation, asks, “And what about love?” Kennington hesitates. The stage is silent. Then, at last, he mutters, “Love is the worst tyranny of all.”<br><br>The house lights rose to stunned silence. Critics shuffled out, dazed, as if emerging from a very particular kind of fever dream, one populated by toga-clad senators whispering innuendos in smoky corridors, power being transacted in glances, the long arc of history bending, as always, towards this man’s personal obsessions.<br><br>Following the play’s opening night, I sought an audience with the man himself. Vidal, ensconced in his Italian villa, <i>La Rondinaia</i>, received me with the same amusement of a Roman senator watching the Visigoths breach the gates.<br><br><b>Winchell</b>: Surely you realize people will see this as a grudge play? A particularly florid way of getting revenge on Robert Kennedy for, let’s say, declining to invite you to dinner?<br><br><b>Vidal</b>: Thomas, what is history but a grudge? Caesar had his Brutus, Christ had his Judas, and I had that little Massachusetts bantam with a persecution complex. But how sad to live in a nation so starved of imagination that any story of a doomed Republic must, by necessity, be about the Kennedys. How sad, indeed, that when one writes of power and betrayal, of moral failure dressed in piety, of men who clutch their rosaries with the same fervor as they clutch their secret shames, one must endure the tiresome accusation that it is about Robert Francis Kennedy.<br><br><b>Winchell</b>: All very poetic. But what about the endless, inescapable suggestion that President Kennington was in love with Vice President Byr—pardon me, Tolliver?<br><br><b>Vidal</b>: Did I suggest it? I merely observed. If you find the idea so compelling, so persuasive, so impossible to ignore, well, what does that say about you? <br><br><b>Winchell</b>: But surely you can admit that “Kennington” bears more than a passing resemblance to Robert Kennedy? That Tolliver is, rather obviously, Robert Byrd?<br><br><b>Vidal</b>: Look, it is not about Bobby Kennedy any more than Julius Caesar is about actual Romans. That you insist on seeing it as such only proves how deeply the mythology of that dreary little man has lodged itself in the American brain. How sad for you all.<br><br><b>Winchell</b>: So you are saying, definitively, that Things That Never Were is not about Robert Kennedy?<br><br><b>Vidal</b>: Nope.<br><br><b>Winchell</b>: Mr. Vidal, this play already existed. In the seventies. Same title. It was explicitly about Robert Kennedy. It flopped, badly.<br><br><b>Vidal</b>: The past, Thomas, is a country best ruled by those with imagination. If I have rescued a forgotten work from the graveyard of bad ideas and given it a more compelling life, well, that is simply the duty of an artist.<br><br><b>Winchell</b>: You lifted a play about Robert Kennedy and just… did it again.<br><br><b>Vidal</b>: If one cannot improve upon history, one must at least make it more amusing.<br><br><b>Winchell</b>: So you admit it is about Kennedy.<br><br><b>Vidal</b>: Not unless he thought it was. And if he did… one must wonder why</span></p></div>`)

Welcome. Come on in.<br><br>You probably heard the drums. Or maybe someone handed you a flyer in Santa Cruz. Or maybe you saw a burned-out school bus with “THINGS LIVES!” painted on the side in eucalyptus oil and love.<br><br>Either way, welcome. You made it. Thank you for being here.<br><br>We are the Dust Harp Players and the <i>Redland Light Cooperative</i> and the <i>Bobby Bus Family</i> and sometimes also the <i>Marin Tuesday Night Improvised Orchestra</i> and <i>Cactus Love Players of Taos</i> (depending on who’s awake and where we are).<br><br>We are not a theatre company. We are a procession!<br><br>A ritual.<br><br>A really long, beautiful sigh about what this country could’ve been.<br><br>Robert Francis Kennedy, yeah. You probably know him from the coin jars or the freeway or the documentaries.<br><br>But our Bobby?<br><br>He’s not marble. He’s <i><b>wild</i></b>. He laughs too hard. He loses his speeches. He wants better and means it. And in ‘72, he tried to run for president. And America said no. Percy won instead. The country gave him everything. And poor Bobby, he was regulated to nothing.<br><br>The show opens in 1972, but not the one from your books. This is the scorched, moonbitten 1972 where Percy wins not because he is good but because he is <b>beautifully hollow</b>. He is glass. He is a mirror. The perfect man for a country afraid of feeling.<br><br>Chairman Morton, the true monster of the piece, is depicted as a retriever in men’s shoes. He fetches policies. He barks on command. He snaps at the ankles of the press and begs for rubs. (He receives them.) He represents the Men Who Knew Better. The ones who told the country to “soften.” Who warned us about “tone.” Who smiled at the rallies and took notes in private.<br><br>The Party Men. The Builders. The Groomers of the Next Cycle.<br><br>In last year’s San Luis Obispo rendition, he was performed by four actors in a trench coat, each speaking one syllable at a time. In Ventura, he was a talking punching bag. The audience was invited to “contribute” mid-scene.<br><br>We’ve been staging this play every summer since 1974.<br><br>The first performance happened after the Percy administration deregulated the arts endowment and shuttered the LA performance grant program. We took over a burned-out rec center. We built a stage from shipping pallets and painted it with crushed berries.<br><br>Now, each summer, somewhere between Joshua Tree and the Rockies and the Washington Rainforest and the edge of New Fresco, we put it on again. Sometimes on a stage. Sometimes in a barn. Once on a canoe.<br><br>Every town has made its own version.<br><br>In Watsonville, Percy was a butcher who speaks only in stock quotes.<br><br>In Echo Park, Morton is performed by an actual dog in a child’s suit jacket.<br><br>In Chico, the set is a gas station. Kennedy gives his monologue through a payphone.<br><br>And this is not a flattering role. It is not a messiah role. It is not presidential.<br><br>Kennedy is broken. He screams too early. He apologizes too much. He doesn’t win.<br><br>But he is allowed to feel. And that is the point.<br><br>In the North Fork edition, he is played by a 20-year-old trans girl who wore her father’s dress shoes and sobbed through the second act. In the Oakland Black Box, he was portrayed by a 52-year-old ex-union leader, who smoked through the entire performance and changed none of the pronouns.<br><br>He is always in the wrong outfit. Always underfed. Always pacing.<br><br>He is grief without solution. But he tries anyway.<br><br>It’s the story of Bobby trying to get back to us.<br><br>It’s the story of what would’ve happened if we’d let love win the election.<br><br>There are puppets. There are lanterns. There is a dog who plays Morton and a girl named Zuzu who plays six senators at once. The Secret Service is just a guy on roller skates with a bubble gun. Charles Percy floats in on a helium cloud and offers people bland unity. Nobody takes it.<br><br>The ending changes every night depending on the stars.<br><br>NOW IS IT SERIOUS?<br><br>Yeah.<br>No.<br>Kind of.<br><br>You’ll laugh. You’ll cry. You’ll forget what year it is. And then, after Bobby loses again, because he always does… you’ll help us raise the flag.<br>It’s hand-stitched. 84 feet long.<br>It reads,<br><br><i>MAYBE NEXT TIME.</i><br><br>If you want to host us, let us know.

AND BEER!!!) and last somewhere between two hours and a lifetime.<br><br>MUSIC?<br><br>Yes. Always. Banjo, cello, singing bowls, harmonium, goat bell, tambourine, harmonica, toy piano, voice, wind, earth, <i><b>you</i></b>.<br>WHY DO THIS?<br>Because we miss him. <br>Well, he's not dead! But the era.<br>But everything we never got.<br>The world where it mattered that a man cried.<br>The world where grief made you worthy.<br>The world where <i><b>you could love your country and still want it to be better.</i></b><br>Because when Zuzu does her “I Am The Electoral College” dance in an inflatable star costume, the kids go feral.<br>Because when the puppet Nixon screams “YOU’RE TOO SOFT, BOBBY,” someone always yells back, “AND YOU’RE TOO HARD.”<br>Because <i><b>someone has to remember.</i></b><br><br>Find us on Channel 96.7 FM between dusk and dawn. Look for the flyers in coffee shops with dirt floors. Follow the glowstick trail off Route 1.

                <i>EXCLUSIVE: “I Am That Man”: Mel Gibson On Playing RFK, American Cowardice, and His New Favorite Role</i></h3><p><span style=\"color:#111111;\">
                By <b>Jeri Costa</b> | American Heat | July 2014<br><br>Mel Gibson is not here to apologize. He is here to be heard.<br><br>When I meet him at a hotel bar in Manhattan, barely disguised in a trench coat and straw hat, he greets me not with a handshake but with a line from Robert F. Kennedy’s 1968 Cleveland speech. “This mindless menace of violence!” he growls, pounding his fist once on the table. “That’s the guy. That’s the guy I'm playing.”<br><br>The guy in question: RFK, as imagined in <i>Broken Plinth</i>, the new eight-part political psychodrama from WeCrave Originals. It’s a raw, jittering take on the twilight days of Kennedy’s presidency, and Gibson, 58 and wild-eyed, is in every scene. Literally.<br><br>“There are no cutaways,” he says proudly. “I told them, ‘You keep that camera on me. Even if I’m just breathing. Especially if I’m just breathing.’ That’s the real man. That’s Bobby.”<br><br>The show opens in a half-lit West Wing hallway, where Kennedy mutters to himself and punches a portrait of Charles Percy. From there, it spirals. Gibson’s Bobb is frayed, furious, barely clinging to the illusion of civility. He hisses. He whispers. He breaks a glass in his hand in Episode 2 and bleeds all over the Cabinet Room. In Episode 4, he screams ”<i>DO YOU THINK I CARE ABOUT ILLINOIS?</i>” before tackling an aide to the ground.<br><br>“I improvised that,” Gibson says. “He <i>didn’t</i> care about Illinois. The people don’t understand that. He wasn’t playing the game. He was the game.”<br><br>Gibson speaks of Kennedy not like a president, or even a political martyr, but like an unfinished character, one he’s been waiting decades to play. He tried to buy the rights to <i>Things That Never Were</i> in the '90s (he says he was blocked by “a coalition of cowards and liars”), and claims to have a first edition of <i>To Seek a Newer World</i> in his bathroom and a framed photograph of the 1972 concession speech on his bedroom wall.<br><br>When asked if he relates to Kennedy, Gibson leans back and gives me the look, the one that says, you already know.<br><br>“They ruined him,” he says. “They wanted sweaters. They wanted cardigan men. They chose Percy. Lindsay. Smiling men with no real blood in them. But Bobby, Bobby was a beast. He carried America on his back and it broke him.”<br><br>The real Kennedy, of course, never commented on Gibson. But sources close to the former president (now 89 and living in near-total seclusion in Hyannis Port) say he once threw a remote across the room during a trailer for the series. The Kennedy Foundation filed three separate statements distancing itself from the production. “I don’t care,” says Gibson. “You think I’m doing this for approval? He <i>lost</i>. I’m the one telling the story now.”<br><br>While Gibson’s RFK is practically Shakespearean in his blood-soaked fury, the series portrays Charles Percy and John Lindsay as distant, technocratic functionaries, sipping tea while Rome burns. In one particularly viral scene, Lindsay offers Kennedy a “cool towel” as the president collapses on the floor.<br><br>“It’s about the war for America’s soul,” says showrunner Vince Vaughn. “And what happens when the wrong side wins.”<br><br>Gibson says he doesn’t care about awards. But his team is already quietly positioning <i>Broken Plinth</i> for Emmy season.<br><br>“It’s not about recognition,” he says, removing his sunglasses to reveal two glassy, red-rimmed eyes. “It’s about giving the man his due. Let them smear my name. Let them blacklist me. I played the last president who <i>meant it</i>.”<br><br>He leans over my drink.<br><br>“And I’d play him again.”</span></p></div>`)

                Gordon Willis and Alan Pakula on <i>The Minucius File</i></h3><p><span style=\"color:#d6ced6;\">
                <i>The following is a transcript of an interview of Alan Pakula, conducted by Tom Milne, that was originally published in the Spring 1975 issue of Sight & Sound.</i><br><br>TM: Mr. Pakula, for years your name was only known to keen observers of the credits of Robert Mulligan films, in your days before saddling up to the director’s seat yourself. You were, of course, a producer on To Kill a Mockingbird, as well. But now for your fourth feature, there is already an emerging discussion of the “Pakula Style,” between this, The Minucius File, and your previous film, Kirkland. That was a seedy New York City romance about a young prostitute, played expertly by Faye Dunaway, falling for a hired P.I., portrayed by the always-excellent Walter Matthau in a highly unexpected dramatic turn. So tell me, what made you move on up to making films about presidents and assassinations, from that tiny Greenwich Village apartment on to the White House?<br><br>AP: Right, well first I should say, the film didn’t do well. I mean we’re a business first, it’s sad to say, but that’s the honest truth. Some people have said there was a disconnect with the cast, who were brilliant by the way, and the script. Maybe so. But clearly, whatever it was, there wasn’t a strong response to it. And to that I would have said, who gives a shit, I make what I want. But that’s not the reality of this business. Still the folks at Paramount were familiar with me, they knew my work, and I had this idea rattling around my head that eventually I told them. The elevator pitch is that in this country, there are two ways to assassinate a president, one is with a bullet, and the other is with a ballot. And it’s not about who’s pulling the trigger, Oswald or Ray or some other nut, it’s about who bought the bullets and the ballots.<br><br>When we talk about elections in this country, people have a fucked up sense of perspective, right? I mean we think we’re this great nation because we pick one of two options every four years on the dot, but so does half the rest of the world, and they still have presidents and prime ministers thrown out. Chile had elections, and look what happened to them, you think we’re so different? But for some reason, when a concerted campaign, inside government, through the media, and utilizing the intelligence agencies, when that campaign against a president destroys him in an election, we’re too brainwashed to recognize it. And that’s a shame, but it’s the goddamn point too, it’s what they want us to think. That Kennedy just lost because of this state or that state and oh Percy was just such a damn fine candidate. Bullshit, man, bullshit. That’s not true at all. It was a coup.<br><br>So sure, there’s a style, if you look at Kirkland, I mean, that’s a film about private individuals stalking other individuals, using the methods of a police state, like wiretaps and all that, but it’s still a very personal story. But The Minucius File, it’s about private individuals, unaccountable to government, using the tools of government against a public official, in this case the president. So I don’t think they’re opposing stories. People mention the scale of it has changed, but I’ve always been fascinated by scale, and that’s something Gordon [Willis] was really clued in on. There’s this shot in the film of President O’Sullivan in the film, where Redford starts in the Oval Office, staring out the window, and then the camera moves out and out and out, and finally we’re far above the White House, practically in the clouds, with the buildings and monuments literally overshadowing it, and suddenly that power of the presidency looks so small.<br><br>TM: Well on the point about scale, some have noted that, while like you said, the president in this is a fictional man perhaps inspired by Robert Kennedy, there’s actually already been an adaptation of the second Kennedy presidency and the 1972 election. The failed Broadway musical Things That Never Were, it was this legendary disaster, rushed out in ‘73 because everyone involved thought Kennedy would win in ‘72 and that would be the second act, and it got savaged by the theater critics, but it’s had a bit of a second life, with bootleg copies of the album circulating. Did you ever see it?<br><br>AP: I did, actually. I mean, when I started this career, I was more interested in theaters than in films, which I know sounds like a bullshit answer, but I’m being honest with you. In the academic world, at Yale, where I majored in drama, films were looked down upon, and theater was seen as a serious career in the arts. Today I think that’s totally reversed. It’s a big generation gap and I’m on the other side of it. Films are now treated with this sort of holy reverence and theater, especially musical theater, is kind of looked down on as this populist phony stuff for tourists. And it’s a shame. That musical, I mean, look, I can tell how much time goes into this shit, so I have a lot of respect for the artists involved, but I think they’d be the first to tell you it wasn’t the play they wanted to put on. <br><br>Honestly when I first started thinking about this film, I considered making a musical, actually more than considered, it got pretty far. I knew Liza [Minnelli] from The Sterile Cuckoo, my first film, and one of her very first as an actress. So we both were getting started at the same time in this business, and we’ve stayed in touch, and for a while I was talking with her about making a film about a sort of Kennedy-esque figure, played by Liza in drag, and it would be a musical. This was well before the election. But eventually when I saw Cabaret, I mean, shit, that was the whole thing. Fall of democracy and rise of fascism and all, I mean that’s what we had been talking about, so forget it, it didn’t happen. I’d love to work with her again, but I mean, that idea’s been done, and it’s been done a lot better than I ever could.<br><br>But when I say rise of fascism, I mean people recoil at that word, it’s terrible, they say well how could some schmuck like Chuck Percy be anyone’s idea of a modern Mussolini, but that’s not the fucking point, right? I’m not talking about the individual who beats Kennedy. That’s the bullet. What you’ve gotta do is look at who’s buying him, follow the money he got, and that’ll lead you to those big multinational corporations of the world, the modern day nation states. Did you know he got paid more from BP than the oil men who sit on their board did last year? And they just call that “campaign contributions” and it’s legal. It’s a fucking disgrace. This guy was bought and sold by these companies to defeat a president who, God willing, was doing what he could to reign them in. To end the fucking war and cut off their cash flow for more helicopters, more guns, all of that shit. <br><br>That’s what the film’s about. It’s about a president, doing the best he can, cornered by all these larger forces. They invent scandals and try to end his career, all because he’s ruining their bottom line, and I mean look where it’s gotten us. They told us Percy and Nixon were these new dynamic forces, new politics, new Nixon. Like that bastard didn’t commit treason to try to steal the election before that. But Percy has this shit going on with the gold standard too. I mean, they try to tell us he’s really putting up a fight, cause look how angry those companies got with his peace plan in the Mideast. Bullshit. He just changed locations. Now he’s talking about going back into Cambodia. He’s lost his fucking mind.</span></p></div>`)

                Twenty years ago marks the day that Tom Hayden (D-CA) read the entire script of “Things That Never Were” into the official record.<br><br>Hayden, an anti-Vietnam activist, was elected to the Senate for the first time in what was seen as a blow to George Deukmeijan’s agenda in 1986. In what became known as the ‘New Left Election’ after leaked files revealed Deukmeijan’s direct involvement in trying to encourage former Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver to run against the former SDS President, Hayden prevailed resoundingly, which coincided with immense losses for the Republican Party in the 1986 midterms.<br><br>From there, Hayden became well known for his stunts in Congress, particularly against Presidents Hatch and Dole. His most famous of these stunts, however, was in 2002, whilst Hatch was in the midst of trying to pass his most controversial legislation, the Safety Act, increasing the ability of the FBI to surveil so called “government threats”.<br><br>Hayden, a fierce opponent to the legislation along with other progressive Senators such as Bill Bradley and Les AuCoin, called a subcommittee meeting into hearing. There, he began to read out the entire script of a broadway show titled “Things That Never Were”.<br><br>Things That Never Were has its own story. A historically based broadway show based off of President Robert Kennedy’s controversial time in office, it seeks to retell and bring to life the history of the era. While critically acclaimed, it landed flatter in terms of audience reception -  many cited the fact they were not particularly invested in the events of the four years, nor did many particularly want to relive turbulent times in America.<br><br>Hayden, however, was a noted fan of the show, and advocated for it to be brought to the <a>Kennedy Center</a>. Thus, it was only sensible that Hayden’s protest against the act would include the screenplay. As he read the script outline over the span of two and a half hours to a mostly empty committee room, Hayden began visibly tearing up.<br><br>As he wiped his eyes, he decried the Safety Act, proclaiming that “Kennedy would never do such a thing. To monitor millions of Americans, because you don’t like the way they talk about the Kuwaiti War. We need new role models in America, because someone like Orrin Hatch isn’t someone I would want near my family.”<br><br>While initially condemned for his outburst, the effects were clear. Upon signing the law, Hatch saw his approval ratings sink to 30%, and the party was slaughtered at the polls that year. He declined to run for re-election in 2004.<br><br>Things That Never Were itself <a>saw a broadway revival</a>, going on to become a hit on the stage with an all new cast. When Hayden passed away in 2016, the show was finally brought to the Kennedy Center, as a posthumous honor for the prominent senator. <br><br>What America needs now more than ever is someone with the bravery of Senator Hayden. The immunity that politicians enjoy is notable, and yet, no one has dared to speak quite like him in favor of activism. It is our hope here that more congressmen will speak out, like he did, against rising tyranny and authoritarianism.</span></p></div>`)

                Siskel & Ebert</h3><h4><i>Transcript of “RFK Review” (6/21/1998)</i></h4><p><span style=\"color:#d6ced6;\">
                Clip from “RFK”<br><br>EBERT: Oliver Stone’s gripping new film “RFK” tells the story of the 1972 presidential contest between the pugnacious President Robert F. Kennedy and elitist Nelson Rockefeller. Starring David Duchovny as Robert Kennedy and Tommy Lee Jones as put-upon vice president Russell Long, this hard-edged political thriller alleges a vast, business-led conspiracy to bring down the president. <br><br>Clip from “RFK”<br><br>EBERT: Nelson Rockefeller—played by Jack Nicholson with echoes of Jack Torrence—switches effortlessly between a sunny public disposition and a brutish private persona. The one constant is that he’ll do anything to be elected president—that includes outright spying, subversion, and outright subversion of the FBI.<br><br>Clip from “RFK”<br><br>EBERT: And “RFK” is one of the movies we’ll be reviewing this week for <i>Siskel & Ebert</i>, along with our own unscientific survey about what movies we should be screening at the White House. I’m Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times.<br><br>SISKEL: And I’m Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune and my bottom line is that “RFK” is full of some very questionable material but also full of undeniably compelling entertainment. Oliver Stone once again shows that he is at the top of his game, using every cinematic trick in the book to convince the audience that the 1972 election was an effective <i>coup d’etat</i> involving everyone from the FBI to the CIA from the military to the media.<br><br>SISKEL: As the lone crusader for truth is Stone’s idealized version of Kennedy, who Duchovny plays as a latter-day Jimmy Stewart. Full of righteous indignation, here he talks to his staff.<br><br>Clip from “RFK”<br><br>SISKEL: What I consider most remarkable about “RFK” is the writing. “RFK” is full of fantastic characters and performances, including Donald Sutherland as a slimy Washington senator whose true allegiances are never clear and Nancy Allen as Kennedy’s wife, who finds herself increasingly isolated in a hostile Washington.<br><br>Many of the themes here will be familiar for those who know Stone’s other work but whereas “War Plan” was weighed down by heavy-handed dialogue and excessive exposition, “RFK” represents a real return to form with marvelous historical sequences that really capture the paranoid feeling of 1970s Washington. It made other films I saw the same day feel very small by comparison. If you accept Stone’s right to interpret history any way he wants, this is a very entertaining piece indeed. I admire Oliver Stone’s nerve.<br><br>EBERT: Nerve is the right word. It’s such a <i>jittery</i> movie. There’s scenes here, including the Vietnam sequences, where Duchovny is shot almost like a boxer on the ropes. I think audiences are going to be leaving this picture with their hearts racing and a great deal of exuberance for what’s in it, even if the history is a little suspect.<br><br>SISKEL: There’s been attacks on it for months. <i>Newsweek</i> had a piece just this week saying it will confuse people. He shows you scenes that aren’t real and makes you think they are… and that’s just a load of baloney. <br><br>EBERT: Oh, don’t get me started! You know, half these people had nothing to say about how much of “<i>Wallace</i>” is just completely fabricated. There’s a scene in here where… where… Nelson Rockefeller appears at the president’s bedside to intimidate him. Now, are people really going to think that the Governor of New York broke into the president’s bedroom? I don’t think so. Intelligent moviegoers are capable of distinguishing reality from fantasy.<br><br>SISKEL: A lot of this material is from… the Broadway show. Now, I’ve never seen it. Obviously he took out the singing, but much of it is clearly melodrama that has its origins on stage. You can’t tell me that your average moviegoer is going to think that five future presidents actually sat in a room together to plot out the next 20 years of elections.<br><br>EBERT: No, no. I think a lot of audiences will correctly identify the <i>emotional</i> truth but recognize the clear liberties—.<br><br>SISKEL: And I think they’ll also recognize that this is a conspiracy that the American public itself was in on. That’s something that I hear is a big point in the original stage show.<br><br>EBERT: Uh huh.<br><br>SISKEL: In the sense of… wanting things too easy. In the sense of siding with the big powers over the little guy. Look, I remember that time and there’s a lot of Americans who never got over the… the trauma of that period. There’s a lot of people who have buyer’s remorse after how things went in Cambodia and Persia. Kennedy really comes across as this little guy with his foot in door. I have reason to believe that the whole… nightmare of that time could have been averted had he gotten a second term, just like his brother eight years before. At least a better chance than with Rockefeller, Jackson, Bush, and whomever else running the ship. <br><br>EBERT: Well, (laughing) let’s not go too far by calling him a “little guy”. He was president.<br><br>SISKEL: Oh, but I think most America feels that he was one man against the world. I mean, just look at how he ranks stacked up to Rockefeller and the others.<br><br>EBERT: I am surprised we haven’t heard anything from him at all since it came out.<br><br>SISKEL: Oh, I don’t think he wants this thing swallowed up in any more controversy after the JFK fiasco, especially with his nephew running for president. But that’s all beside the point. There’s some great performances in this picture that won’t get the recognition they deserve. And that’s a shame because I think there’s some tremendous work here.<br><br>EBERT: It’s too painful for some people, but, you know, a lot of the stuff that is real in this film is fascinating—especially the whole Rockefeller-Kissinger connection and the 1968 sabotage that we’re only just learning about decades later.<br><br>SISKEL: You’re right, Roger. And these are the kinds of things that people are now discussing. I truly believe that… we’d have been out of Vietnam by 1973 if Kennedy had been elected for a second term. <br><br>EBERT: There’s a lot to argue about but if there’s one thing I think we can both agree on it’s that “RFK” is a terrific movie. It really is a terrific movie.</span></p></div>`)

                By <b>Dorothy Crawford</b> and <b>Judy Davis</b> | 5/27/2011 05:52 PM EDT<br><br><span style="display: block; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><b>Welcome to POLITICO’s West Wing Playbook,</b><i>your guide to the people and power centers in the Gingrich administration.</i></span><br><span style="color:#015DA6">Send tips</span> | <span style="color:#015DA6">Subscribe here</span> |<br><br>Hillary’s got a Gaga problem and it ain’t going away. Since VICE PRESIDENT HILLARY RODHAM has begun her presidential campaign ahead of next year’s election, she has sought one coveted endorsement from a singularly influential figure, and it’s not the man sitting in the White House. <br><br>Core to the Rodham campaign’s youth engagement is securing the support of LADY GAGA, the global pop superstar, and sometimes-wearer of meat dresses (uh, yeah). Gaga and her devoted <u style="color:#015DA6">“little monsters”</u> hold a massive reach on social media, with the singer herself commanding a massive 61 million LifeLog followers. Republican Party strategists believe she could prove enormously helpful in getting the Vice President’s message across to young people, who historically have low participation rates in presidential elections, peaking in 1972 and declining each year since.<br><br>Publicly, Gaga’s been silent on the looming 2012 election, as she was in 2008, despite occasionally wading into politics. The pop star issued a plea for empathy in her 2010 Grammy’s acceptance speech, citing recent Supreme Court decisions restricting abortion access and homosexual rights, and repeating the name of her top Billboard hit: “They’re Just Like That.” Her comments brought swift online backlash, including from some Democratic institutions, like the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Family Values, which called Gaga’s speech “a sop to sodomy and the slaughter of infants.”<br><br>In a very pointed clapback two weeks later, Gaga attended the previously obscure musical, <i>Things That Never Were</i>, a satire of the second Kennedy administration and the party realignment that followed. Still coy, when Gaga was asked about her attendance in a 45 Minutes interview with Anderson Cooper, she demurred, saying she was only there to see Mary J. Blige, and wasn’t interested in the historical aspects. Uh, sure. Whatever the excuse, every <i>Things That Never Were</i> show sold out almost immediately after she was spotted in the crowd.<br><br>It’s that enormous sway with the millennial generation that Rodham is eager to tap in to. Maybe a little too eager. In a town hall last week, the Vice President mimicked another answer Gaga gave in her <i>45 Minutes</i> interview, telling a Pennsylvania voter that her schedule was exhausting. “No sleep! Rally, interview, another interview, another rally, plane, next place, polls!” Uhhh awkward!<br><br>One Rodham advisor told us the campaign gets the criticism, but that any added benefits of getting Gaga in their camp will outweigh all the baggage Rodham comes with. “Even just one tweet,” the advisor sighed. “Just a ‘hillary IS a little monster’ could save the world.”<br><br><b>WHAT WE’RE READING</b><span style="font-size:15px"><br><span style="color:#015DA6">Cynicism and Stagnancy</span> (Ben Rhodes for HuffPo)<br><span style="color:#015DA6">Bring Back the FBI?

                In the closing weeks of a presidential election defined almost entirely by sameness (“security, “values”, “normalcy”), Pixar has released a film that is, whether it means to be or not, a sharp rebuke to the culture of good-enoughness. <i>Incredible</i>, directed by Brad Bird and featuring the most stylized family of costumed idealists since <i>The Rocketeer</i>, doesn’t feel like a product of this moment. It feels like something else: a dispatch from a future we were promised and never received.<br><br>Bird has made no secret of his inspiration. In an interview with <i>FilmTone</i>, he admitted that portions of the emotional structure of <i>Incredible</i> were lifted from <i>Things That Never Were</i>, the failed stage play based on the collapse of the Robert Kennedy campaign in 1972. The play, long out of print, imagines RFK as a man out of time, brilliant but unwelcome, consumed by a nation that no longer rewards greatness. Stating that Kennedy was “the last gifted man in a country that decided it didn’t like gifts.”<br><br>Bird sees this as tragedy. Conservative press sees it as elitism.<br><br>They hate it.<br><br>They hate Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible), whom they call “entitled.” They hate the son, Dash for being, “insubordinate.” They hate the daughter, Violet, for being “gothic.” They hate Elastigal most of all, for having an, what the <i>Clarion Ledger</i> called “the unwholesome figure of a campaign ad housewife gone rogue.” This is what happens when a film tries to be actually complicated in 2004. Conservatives freak about the iconography (the family! the politics! the thighs!), and others don’t read between the lines. Neither is seeing for what it is: a lonely eulogy for a world that never got to happen.<br><br>Every aesthetic decision in <i>Incredible</i>, from the brutalist architecture to the jazz-inflected score, is being read as hostile to the values of the Goldwater Era. And in many ways, they’re not wrong. The film begins with superheroes being forced into hiding by litigation and ends with them breaking the law to stop a washed up prairie-born tech villain from flattening the world into the same sameness. The message is that giftedness is real, and we’re wrong to deny it. <br><br>It isn’t a film that critiques superhero regulation. It’s a critique of <i>cultural regulation</i>. Of the creeping ideology that says you shouldn’t stand out. Your best qualities should be hidden, softened, equalized.<br><br>And if you’ve lived under the Goldwater Doctrine for the last 32 years, this will sound very familiar. The president himself, son of the same Barry Goldwater who brought this on, elected with slogans like “A Safe Course”, has made a point not to chase big dreams. His State of the Union earlier this year called for “expanding the highway program” and “humility in American schooling.”<br><br>And when asked about <i>Incredible</i>? The White House said: “<i>We don’t comment on cartoons.</i>”<br><br>Is <i>Incredible</i> politically dangerous? No, as the White House said, it’s a cartoon. But it’s a cartoon that suggests something deeply unfashionable now. That the world owes something to those who can make it better. And maybe, we don’t need to apologize for being the best at something.<br><br>That doesn’t mean we return to dynasty politics or hero-worship. God knows the Kennedy nostalgia has been chewed through twice. But it does mean we reckon with what we’ve lost in our relentless, bipartisan struggle to make the world streamlined.<br><br>It is not trying to fix the country. It is mourning.<br><br>Something we never got. Because Bird, in his own strange, retro-futurist way, is imagining a world where Kennedy <i>didn’t</i> lose. Where talent still mattered. Where ambition wasn’t a sin. Where we were allowed to stand out.<br><br>And in an America that’s spent the last three decades telling us not to stand out, maybe that’s the most radical thing of all.</span></p></div>`)

                <b>By <span style="color:#9408A3;">Kiki Turnkey</span> | November 1st, 2012 | 4:40 am</b><br><br>Are you a <i>Glee</i> fan? Were you wondering what Ryan Murphy’s thoughts were on the 2012 election? What’s that you say, “no, of course not?” Too bad, because apparently we all have to hear them in the show’s newest episode, the horribly titled “Glee That Never Was” (though I suppose I have to give Murphy props for realizing that Glee That Never Were is even worse). Part commentary on the upcoming presidential election, part homage to a classic piece of theater, Glee That Never Was is only more proof that this show increasingly has nothing good to say.<br><br>The plot itself is relatively simple-in an attempt to get the members of the club excited about civic engagement and the upcoming election, Will Schuester (in a surprisingly earnest moment from the increasingly morally unmoored character, more proof that the show just doesn’t know what to do with him anymore), proposes the club hold a production of the classic musical “Things That Never Were,” the late seventies love letter of sorts to the RFK era. A classic proposal-God knows my high school held it probably ten times just to try to get the theater kids to pay attention in history class, but it swiftly descends into chaos as Schuester’s plan works, forcing the kids to argue with each other over over Cheney and Ford’s hotly contested campaign, and forcing the viewer to relive the juvenile arguments they are sure to have had on facebook through the eyes of even dumber people.<br><br>What makes it most offensive, in what is, to be clear, one of the worst hours of television in the medium’s history, is that ultimately this love letter to diversity, which theoretically embodies the spirit that Things That Never Were became, utterly and completely refuses to embrace that at all. Rachel Berry’s unquestioning support for Ford is, despite her having gay fathers, completely and totally unchallenged. Finn’s support for Cheney and his mumbling justification over his gay daughter is never really explored considering his father’s own death in Venezuela. It’s like the show barely remembers anything about its own characters. This would be fine normally, but when its many impressionable kids’ first real look at the modern political sphere it really does them a disservice. <br><br>Its handling of the material is clunky too, and GLADD has made that very clear. Kurt’s performance of Reagan’s role is theoretically competent-his rendition of “That’s Not How I Made It in Hollywood” is one of the least flat in the whole episode, but there is something to me deeply bleak about this attempt to “reclaim” Reagan as some kind of gay icon, considering how he treated gay Americans throughout his presidency. There is nothing liberating about Kurt’s Reagan “queening out” with Finn’s “Hoover,” and at this point in the show frankly Kurt should be far more uncomfortable playing Reagan than Finn is wearing a dress (we already went through this with the Rocky Horror episode anyways). Murphy’s response to GLAAD calling the episode “unconscionably offensive,” has been incredibly tone deaf–he clearly has no interest in dealing with the historical reality of how many homosexual Americans were hurt by Reagan’s wounded ego. His close attempt to do so, giving Sue RFK’s, “Fairy Dust,” just plays into this bizarre wounded morality tale that Reagan was genuinely gay and was projecting. <br><br>I try to reserve F’s for only the worst of the worst episodes of any show, and frankly this is even worse than that. Can I give this an F-? A G? G might stand for gay that would be inappropriate. Either way, after this garbage I almost have no interest in watching the show anymore. If next week’s episode is written about by someone else-blame this one.<br><br><i>Stray Observations</i><br><blockquote>Somehow my husband had avoided seeing Things That Never Were at least once in the thirty years it’s been out, but as a history nerd, all he could do was complain about the inconsistencies. Why is Sue as a parallel to Bobby turned into a racist? He complained about that to me for an hour.<br>I would probably have bumped up the score a bit more if “Bobby Please” was good–it’s one of the most heartbreaking songs in the original, and the part of Lem would have been perfect for Kurt, but the decision to give it to Santana and to make it part of a drawn out heterosexual storyline is just offensive.<br>For how much I complained about it, “Fairy Dust” was really well done, and the portrayal of Robert’s homophobia as a serious character flaw instead of an honest mistake is well done. I’m not sure why Jane Lynch still does the show.<br>If Harold Ford actually wins, this is all going to age extremely poorly. I don’t think he’s going to prove he’s a “secret gay icon.”<br>At least they didn’t go for the Will is RFK shtick. That would have sucked.<br>“Plus Cheney like, got gay married, I think.”</blockquote></span></p></div>`)

                <b><i>By Candace Fox-Heller</i><br>May 1997 | American Circuits</b><br><br>It’s the one where Kenmore won’t salute the flag.<br><br>Season five, episode seven. The president, played, of course, by Stacy Keach in his most iconic role, is seated at the breakfast table in his bathrobe, complaining about “the shallow symbolism of star-spangled nationalism.” Across from him, his steely, patient wife (Shelly Long) pours coffee and reminds him that America isn’t perfect, but it’s still the country he presides over. His youngest, played by former <i>Growing Pains</i> actor Kirk Cameron, salutes the toaster just to make a point.<br><br>By the time Chuck Norris enters as General Lansing, shoving a pocket Constitution into Kenmore’s hands and declaring, “You want to live here? You salute it!” the audience is on its feet.<br><br>Each week, President Kenmore is presented with a dilemma. Be it a runaway daughter, a dishonest secretary, or an offer from the “Hennessey Caucus” to legalize something unseemly, and each week, through tears, pride and the firm hand of his wife, he learns a lesson.<br><br>It is, by every metric, the most successful dramatic morality-comedy in American television history.<br><br>And no one is more upset about it than Robert F. Kennedy.<br><br>In production notes for <i>Things That Never Were</i>, he’s not referred to at all. <br>“Kenmore is fictional,” the writers insist. “Any resemblance is coincidence.”<br><br>Even if Kenmore is Kennedy, <i>TTNW</i> has become the defining cultural afterimage for his era, a parable for American righteousness and executive humility. The show has run for six seasons, spun off two-made-for-TV movies (<i>Kenmore: The Long Winter</i> and <i>Kenmore’s Wild Rockies Ride!</i>), and is the most requested syndicated program at faith-based video rental outlets nationwide.<br><br>It wasn’t always this way.<br><br>The original <i>TTNW</i> premiered in 1974 as an avant-garde stage production. Small, cryptic, riddled with monologue and fluorescent lighting. It depicted a self-important indictment of the American republic, with President Kennedy writhing in angst over power, masculinity, and his inability to feel anything “real.” The play was messy, and it closed in under a year.<br>But Asa Earl Carter, media magnate, former screenwriter, and visionary architect of the <i>Faith & Family Hour</i> brand, saw the play live during its disastrous Los Angeles run in 1981, which he called “a pile of self-pity and soft treason dressed up in stage lighting.” <br><br>But, he also saw an opportunity. By 1983, he had begun to publicly float the idea of “reclaiming” the text as something useful, <i>patriotic</i>, even. “There’s a soul in that play,” he wrote in a <i>Reader’s Digest</i> editorial, “you just have to scrape off all the sin.”<br><br><br>When Carter Enterprises acquired the full rights to the script in 1985 (in a batch sale that also included several minor pamphlets and an incomplete Norman Mailer manuscript), it was seen as a minor asset to most.. except Carter. He saw a character study in hubris. A lesson about what happens when ambition outpaces virtue.<br><br><i>Things That Never Were</i> premiered on CBS in the fall of 1992, reimagined as a weekly morality play with high production value and simple truths. “Kenmore” was no longer a misunderstood genius. He was a man who had once wanted to be good... and had failed. The show’s tagline: “<i>When you forget who you serve, you serve only yourself.</i>”<br><br>It was a hit. A massive one.<br><br>By 1995, <i>Things That Never Were</i> was a household staple, the linchpin of a Friday night lineup that included The McClintocks, Family Allegiance, and Thicker Than Blood (But Not Thicker Than God). It won two Emmys for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series (Keach, 1994 and 1996) and was named “Most Wholesome Program” by the Heritage Council for Broadcast Morality. President Reagan himself, in a 1996 interview, cited the character of Kenmore as “a better Kennedy than the real one.”<br><br>Conservatives have since embraced it. Churches aired it during youth group nights. <i>The Southern Journal</i> called it “a landmark in televised instruction.” It is currently syndicated in eleven countries.<br><br>Which brings us to the lawsuit.<br><br>In late 1996, President Robert F. Kennedy filed suit against Carter Studios, alleging that “Kenmore” was a deliberate and defamatory impersonation of himself, used for profit and ridicule. He claimed emotional harm, professional damage, and a loss of “intellectual and civic dignity.”<br><br>The judge’s ruling, issued in February of this year, held that “Kenmore is wholly a fictional character who may, at times, resemble the public caricature of Mr. Kennedy, but is no more defamatory than Colonel Sanders is to actual poultry farmers.”<br><br>Kennedy’s team responded with a press release. No one has run it. Carter, for his part, has celebrated by writing a guest episode in which Kenmore teaches his youngest son about abstinence using a story about Thomas Jefferson. Laxalt did not comment on the court case, only stating that <i>TTNW</i> was the “best education you can get on a Thursday night.”<br><br>A recent <i>Parade</i> magazine survey revealed that 33% of Americans under 30 believe “Robert Kenmore” was a real president. Syndicated reruns are shown in military bases and airport terminals. In several school districts, clips from <i>TTNW</i> have been approved as civics material.<br><br>Robert Kennedy, now in his seventies, has largely vanished from public life. A grainy photo circulated last year of him shopping for bananas in Vermont. He writes occasionally. He teaches some. He speaks at conferences that no longer make headlines. At a recent appearance in Toronto, he was introduced as “the inspiration for Kenmore.” He did not object.<br><br>America, meanwhile, watches the sitcom. And learns its lessons. And as the credits roll, every week, we hear the same closing line:<br><br>“Character is what remains when power fades.”<br><br>Someone wrote it for the show. No one remembers who. Maybe Carter. Some people think Kenmore said it in season three. Others insist it was a real quote from Kennedy.<br><br>But as any fan will tell you, that’s just one of those <i>Things That Never Were</i>.</span></p></div>`)

Kennedy (Thomas Cruise) struggles to win an election against his opponent, a caricature of Ronald Reagan (Treat Williams). Made just months after President Ronald Reagan left office, President Kennedy’s historical legacy had never been lower. <br><br>Disgraced by his own party for managing to lose to a candidate who many felt was outright unfit for office, Bobby spent the rest of his life secluded at Hyannis Port, away from the press. All this means that we don’t know what Kennedy made of <i>Never</i>, but we do have his comments on record about <i>Things That Never Were</i>, the source material for this ELO musical. Speaking to a New York Times reporter in ‘75, the former president said he doesn’t “have the time nor the patience to sit through any goddamn Broadway show.”<br><br>President Reagan on the other hand was mostly positive on <i>Never</i>, telling reporters at his ranch that “I think I liked it.” Nancy was reportedly not impressed. So was the rest of the nation, which soundly rejected this confusing mess of a film, making it one of the biggest box office bombs of all time.<br><br>The musical was such an enormous flop that it single-handedly killed the career of its promising young star, Thomas Mapother IV, more commonly known as Tom Cruise. Since <i>Never</i>, Cruise never recovered, starring in a few other middling forgotten films, and in 1991 retired from acting.

                1:31:47<br><br>Bill Simmons: Alright, Chris Ryan is here, Sean Fennessey is here. By the time this runs, this will be the 30th anniversary of <i>Split Ticket</i>, from 1993. Great year for legal thrillers.<br><br>Sean Fennessey: <i>The Firm, Philadelphia</i>.<br><br>Bill: <i>Pelican Brief</i>. Nobody brings that one up. If I could just choose to be alive for any three years and do nothing but go to movies. Just be in New York and see movies all day. ‘90 to ‘93 is up there for me.<br><br>Chris Ryan: Yeah.<br><br>Bill: It’s one of the hall-of-fame periods. Lights out. And Richard Gere, one of the most important actors of the 90’s, in the running for one of the most important ever?<br><br>Chris: His run here is unbelievable. <i>Pretty Woman</i>, all the Julia Roberts movies they did, but also <i>Hunt for Red October</i>, <i>Cape Fear</i>, <i>Internal Affairs</i>.<br><br>Sean: He’s got the Kurosawa movie, <i>Rhapsody in August</i>, then he goes off with Scorsese for a bit.<br><br>Bill: When you look at his performances though, not the best movies, but the ones he was best in, <i>The Vote</i>, it’s gotta be his best.<br><br>Sean: It’s up there.<br><br>Chris: [imitating] “You don’t have the votes!!!”<br><br>Bill: So this movie premieres in April of ‘93. First few weeks of the Koch administration, which is important.<br><br>Sean: Right.<br><br>Bill: Because you got all this energy in the air, it’s not just like a political thing, but that election was again this Boston/New York thing. Weld was actually from New York, but people didn’t care about that, that’s how it was viewed. A lot like ‘72-<br><br>Sean: Which <i>Split Ticket</i> is heavily inspired by, for its fictional president.<br><br>Bill: Right, where RFK is seen as like the Bill Russell of Boston, some idiots out there hate him, and he’s got a more complicated history, and he didn’t claim us, but we’ve grown to claim him. Took a few years to set in though. You don’t see framed photos of him above the bar at Sully’s.<br><br>Chris: What’s there now? Larry Bird and JFK?<br><br>Bill: RFK is Brookline anyway. It’s different. Anyway, Sean, Kennedy family - apex mountain?<br><br>Sean: Oh man, I knew you were going to do this, but I thought it would be later. Okay, I’m going ‘68.<br><br>Bill: Okay.<br><br>Sean: Because Teddy is still on the rise, you think he could maybe go all the way, JFK, the memory is still fresh and people still have this literal halo around him, and then Bobby wins. It’s the peak for me.<br><br>Bill: Chris.<br><br>Chris: The Camelot stuff is too stuffy for me. They’re like a car you have to take on a few test drives before you get comfortable with it. I think ‘76, with Teddy’s run, when everyone thought he could make it.<br><br>Bill: Yeah but you get Bobby all strung out by that point. Post-loss, I mean that’s worse than an athlete blowing out their leg in the last stretch, it’s like a Penny Hardaway situation, where the whole country’s like ‘aw man, I really liked RFK, it’s too bad what happened.’<br><br>Sean: So what’s your Kennedy apex mountain then?<br><br>Bill: From a cultural standpoint, it’s gotta be the assassination. The JFK assassination is having a moment right now. <br><br>Sean: That can’t stay in.<br><br>Bill: Forbes is saying he’s releasing all those files, there’s that Nicole Kidman HBO show, where, what is she?<br><br>Sean: <i>Chain of Command</i>, where she’s this sort of shadow player inside Washington, orchestrating assassinations, right. <br><br>Chris: Just won a lot of Emmys. <br><br>Bill: <i>Split Ticket</i> isn’t about any of that though. It’s not an assassination movie, it isn’t really even an election movie?<br><br>Chris: Not at all.<br><br>Sean: If it was it would have to be like 4 hours of riot footage.<br><br>Bill: They show some of that in <i>The Warriors</i>, it was shot in ‘73, the whole thing is just in this burnt wreckage of New York. Then it got shelved cause it was too controversial, and I think it came back in ‘75 or ‘76. ‘75?<br><br>Sean: It was a late release but most people didn’t see it until ‘76. <br><br>Bill: One of the all-time New York movies though. <br><br>Sean: All-time Peckinpahs too.<br><br>Chris: [imitating James Brolin in Sam Peckinpah’s <i>The Warriors</i> getting shot] “Come out to <i>playyy-ayy-ayy!!!</i>”</span></p></div>`)

                <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Skye Jane Cormorant<br><i>December 6, 2022 - <a>glassgrowl.zone</a></i><br><br>When <i>The People’s President</i> dropped on WeStream (for 67 minutes before the takedown notice hit), it felt like being in the room when the bomb went off. I was at a bar in Bed Stuy. They were projecting it on the side of a wall, subtitles only. We screamed. We sobbed. We recognized ourselves. <br><br>People didn’t leave when it went dark. They stayed. One person threw their phone across the floor and yelled, “I knew it wouldn’t last.” I watched a girl in a bubble coat walk out into the rain like she had just witnessed her own death three days early.<br><br>By the time I got home, the Dropbox was already dead. The drive link went to a 404 page that said “<i>This File Has Violated Community Integrity Policies.</i>” A bot on Telegram posted a cropped .webm of the bathroom scene.<br><br>The takedown order from Alder Entertainment came fast. Blunt. Barely legalese. The studio, which owns the ‘72 Campaign Archives and a few errant fragments of Things That Never Were, cited “unauthorized use of protected material” and “substantial thematic proximity to disputed political content.” They didn’t name names. They didn’t have to.<br><br>There is, as of this writing, no legal way to see the film.<br><br><i>The People’s President</i>, a low-budget, largely crowdfunded trans retelling of the 1972 presidential election, written, directed and starred in by an anonymous team, was removed from all digital platforms within 24 hours. No press rollout. No festival circuit. No premiere. Just a single post that read: “The Girlhood of power. 91 minutes. Up now.”<br><br>What Alder Entertainment has failed to understand is that no one is watching this film for the candidates or the campaigns. Sure, they own the footage. But no one watching this film thought it was official.<br><br>Because <i>The People’s President</i> is not official. It is not real, and it is not trying to be. It is a glitch. A hallucination. A queer cinematic experience burrowed into the national archive, whispering: <i>what if he had been her?</i><br><br>In this version, Mayor John Vliet Lindsay, the liberal republican who beat RFK in 1972 and served a single, infamous term, is reimagined as a trans woman. She is never named John. She is never named anything, really. The credits call her “Lindsay,” and her campaign posters just say “Vote Like You Mean It.”<br><br>And against her is the Kennedy polycule (not satire, actually what the film calls them): Bobby, Bobby, and Pat, in what is already being called the “most offensive portrayal of dynastic masculinity since The Crown.” The entire Democratic campaign is portrayed as a love triangle turned death cult, hellbent on exposing Lindsay for being a “performance in heels.”<br><br>There is an extended scene where the three confront Lindsay in a debate hall constructed entirely of CRT televisions. “We know what you were,” they say in union. She responds, “Then you know I never wanted to be that.”<br><br>The film does not explain her transition. It is not a metaphor. It is not subtext. It is just apart of the individual. Something reclaimed awkwardly, angrily, urgently. At one point, a journalist asks her what changed. She replies: “I stopped asking what version of myself they’d understand.”<br><br>There are montages of failure. Leaked phone calls. Incoherent interviews. A four-minute sequence of her eating campaign donuts in silence. The original ending was apparently longer. Sources say it included real footage of Lindsay’s 1972 election night speech, projected over a grainy hallway shot of the actress staring into a mirror. That version has been scrubbed.<br><br>The issue, according to the takedown, is the songs. Apparently the film contains unauthorized musical reinterpretations of <i>TTNW: The Broadway Experience (2002)</i>, including a remix of “Filibuster Heart” and an ambient cover of “Hold the Line, Bobby” performed entirely in synth.<br><br>The director, one “Salvia Halberd,” has stated that the takedown is nothing but “proof that Kennedyism and Lindsayism are ghosts that still want to eat our names.”<br><br>Critics are split. An <i>Atlantic</i> op-ed called it “deranged, brilliant, and possibly illegal.” National Review called it “cinematic graffiti” and the “worst depiction of the Kennedy family since the 1997 MadTV sketch.” Kurt Eichenwald tweeted “what happened to movies.”<br><br>The surviving Kennedy family has released a statement condemning the film’s “intentional defamation of the President,” as well as “the egregious mischaracterization of the succeeding President, John Lindsay, who had a wonderful working relationship with Robert in the following years.”<br><br>A guy on Letterboxd, @righteousforbobby, left a 2,000 word review about how the film “defamed an American dynasty.” He ended it by claiming he had emailed <i>press@robertkennedyarchive.foundation</i> demanding a “full repudiation.” The next day, he posted a screenshot: WeStream banned him for “attempting to provoke harassment of a public figure’s estate.”<br><br>The email, for what it’s worth, is real. It still works. I tried it. No reply.<br><br>No one knows if the former president has been notified of the film. At 97, he reportedly lives between the Kennedy Compound and a private residence in Dublin. When asked by the <i>Boston Review</i> if the Kennedy family if President Kennedy had any comment, a spokesperson for the estate replied, “<i>We find it inappropriate to dignify fictional insults with real answers.</i>”<br><br>When asked in turn if the team would contest the takedown, an anonymous spokesperson for the film simply replied, “<i>We’re used to being removed.</i>”<br><br>We are not supposed to imagine Lindsay this way. We are not supposed to care. He’s a blip. A failed compromise. A ghost of a party that no longer exists.<br><br>But we do care. In this version, she loses differently. She wins differently. She means differently.<br><br>She is not a paragon of saintly virtue. She is not the message. She is someone who changed everything and still wasn’t forgiven. She is a woman who made herself real and paid for it.<br><br>Is the movie good? That’s the wrong question.<br><br>It exists.

                Welcome to a weekend in my life as a 29 year old living by himself in DC!<br><br>Friday had been a long day at work–we were just finishing up a series of deliverables for helping the brave Mujahideen fighting in Afghanistan, and you can check the link in my bio for how to donate to the freedom fighters, but I was excited to get a good nights’ rest after such an extensive project. First though, me and some coworkers decided to treat ourselves, heading to Taverna Cretekou in Old Town for gyros, beer, and old fashioned Greek cooking! After that, I headed home for a night’s rest, finally getting to watch the Pats game before going to bed. It’s incredible how Tom Brady still has it.<br><br>Saturday morning I slept in a little, getting up at 8 am, before taking a phone call with my good friend you might know from Boston, Sandy Sharp. Sandy, if you’re watching this, I hope you remember I’m rooting for you on the CFA exam. Third time’s the charm! After that I got brunch with a friend at Lincoln’s Waffle Shop, a great little hole in the wall, before we headed for eighteen holes at the East Potomac Golf Links. <br><br>From there, I headed down to Navy Yard to see a few friends for dinner at the Salt Line, where we got Lobster Chowder and mushrooms, before we took the subway back up to the Kennedy Center for the performance our employer comped for us, a new production of <i>Things That Never Were</i>, the classic 1970s musical about Presidents RFK and John Lindsay. The performance was ecstatic–the guy who played Bobby Kennedy really embodied the kind of safe, assuring masculinity that modern American men need to provide, and I was deeply impressed with how positive a role model he and Lindsay were. I don’t like to get political on this channel, but I really do have to say that while I respect President Pete, I do wish he’d shown some of that Kennedy backbone when his party tried to water down his tax cuts. RFK truly is an inspiration to us all. <br><br>After the show, we got drinks at North Adams before I headed to bed and watched an old rerun of Show Me The Money. <br><br>Sunday was a busy day because I was headed up to the Capitol, where I was honored to spend the day with Senator Kilmer. I got to show him some of my classic moves and talk to him about how we can better help America’s young men get their best foot forward in this economy. <br>	<br><blockquote>J: Okay so you step forward like this-<br>VK: Like this?<br>J: Exactly like that, lean forward, and do the nod.<br>VK: Like that?<br>J: Yeah now you’ve got it!</blockquote><br><br>Senator Kilmer told me he really liked <i>Things That Never Were</i> too, and that that musical was half the reason he got into politics in the first place. Isn’t it amazing what Bobby Kennedy inspired? Mr. President, if you’re watching this, I hope you’re having an amazing hundredth birthday!<br><br>After my meeting at the Capitol, I met up with a few friends to do brunch at Founding Farmers, went for a run around the Lincoln Memorial, and then got happy hour at Founding Farmers again. From there, we all headed home, and I got to editing this video before getting some rest for another wonderful week. That’s my weekend in DC, and thank you all for watching.</span></p></div>`)

                <span style="color:#111121;">John Lindsay and Rob Schneider are eerily similar in many ways.</span><br>October 28, 2019, 10:00 AM EST<br><br>There are few mediums of entertainment that can explain President Rob Schneider and his populist rise, the amalgamation of decades of interbreeding between political and celebrity culture. For years, it has been difficult for pop culture to truly grasp American politics beyond the scheming Lyndon Johnson-esque actors of HBO's <i>Dynasty</i> and the inspiring President Lockwood of <i>Crisis</i>, based on Rudy Giuliani. Most of these figures are written as willing politicians, those who know the system in and out, but that has never been true for President Schneider, the first occupant of the Oval Office to never hold an elected office prior.<br><br>Schneider, too, has expressed an inability to take control of his own public image. In June 2018, the president traveled to his old stomping grounds on Studio 8H to make a surprise appearance on <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, where the former comedian and actor gained his status in the first place. Schneider had made multiple public comments expressing dismay at how the program treated him, both during the 2016 Presidential campaign and the first year of his administration. On the show, he was clearly uncomfortable with cast members, especially the show's other guest star for the night, who played President Schneider in the cold open, Steve Buscemi. Reportedly, the president had a heated confrontation with Lorne Michaels right before they went on air.<br><br>The media confusion around Schneider reached an all-time high after the president announced he was leaving the Democratic Party earlier this month, officially registering as an independent. CNN, MSNBC, and internet sites across the web expressed profound confusion at his sudden decision, which came out of nowhere. In the midst of his re-election campaign as a member of the party, why would Schneider suddenly walk out? There seemed to be very little thought behind the choice, and many wondered what spurred the decision.<br><br>The answer rests in a failed musical production bankrolled by another man who sat behind the Resolute Desk, a surging social media platform, and the strained political culture of the 1970s.<br><br><b style="font-size: 20px;">America's Mayor</b><br>Earlier this month, Schneider visited Broadway, attending the most recent production of a formerly obscure musical by the name of <i>America's Mayor</i>, about the life, career, and presidency of New York's own John Lindsay. The show surged in popularity after two of its songs, '<i>Broadway President</i>', about Lindsay's attempts to create a Department of Culture, blocked by Congressional Republicans, and '<i>February 1969</i>', a ballad about the mayor's struggles during the 1969 nor'easter that paralyzed the city and nearly killed Lindsay's political career, went viral on Quibi. Streams of the musical's songs skyrocketed in the weeks after it went rival, and so did a popular push to put the show back into production. In late 2018, a renewed show was announced for summer 2019, which opened to a filled crowd in August.<br><br>The musical, which was produced, bankrolled, and even partially written by Lindsay between when he left office in 1981 and the first live show in 1985, was created during the peak popularity of another political musical, which, similarly to America's Mayor gained a cult following later in life, <i>Things That Never Were</i>, about Lindsay's predecessor Robert F. Kennedy. Ironically, opposite to Lindsay's creation, Kennedy reportedly had zero interest in the show about his one term in office.<br><br>Although it opened to promising numbers in March 1985 with Lindsay playing himself in the first performances of the show, America's Mayor ended up becoming a critical flop, with Lindsay regretfully disowning his own brain child, dismayed at having burned so much of his money on such a horrific result. Over the years, the musical gained a cult following, especially as internet communities began to prop up. In 2002, an ailing Lindsay noted how happy he was about the interest young people seemed to be having in his life, mostly because he had become something of a forgotten figure ever since leaving office.<br><br>With 44 songs, the climax of Lindsay's musical comes after the song 'Broadway President', where, after a fiery meeting with Senator Bob Dole, Congressman (and future President) Don Rumsfeld, and Richard Nixon, he storms out to a press conference, announcing his intention to leave the Republican Party in favor of the Democrats, who promise to help him create the Department of Culture. Lindsay's own feelings on various figures shine through with a sniveling, cowardly Nixon, a scheming Robert Byrd attempting to get him to switch parties, and, unsurprisingly, his own bravery as a hero<br><br>Although dismissed as nothing more than another politician in the immediate months after his party switch, it eventually grew to represent Lindsay's bravery as Commander in Chief, earning him awards, bestselling books, and a second term in the historically close 1976 election.<br><br><b style="font-size: 20px;">Schneider's Tears</b><br>Only seconds after leaving the theater, Schneider told reporters he felt a deep connection to his predecessor, with some claiming the confident and sometimes obnoxious president had tears in his eyes. There's ample reason for Schneider to feel Lindsay's presence, as his battles with the socially liberal Congressional Democrats have similarly spilled into public, with the president publicly attacking Speaker of the House Jerry Springer as a "woke fraud."<br><br>His attempts to get Democrats to triangulate on social and economic issues, pointing to his own success over Joe Scarborough in the 2016 election, have been a failure. In the 2018 midterms, Schneider endorsed candidates lost almost all of their races, with many saying it was directly because of his support. Of those who didn't fail in the primary, shockingly few made it through to the general election.<br><br>Only two days before his nationally televised announcement, Schneider replaced his Oval Office portrait of Robert Kennedy with John Lindsay. During his announcement, the now independent president invoked his predecessor over five times, directly citing his famous speech, claiming that he was not elected to be a "Democratic rubber-stamp, but a President for the American people."<br><br>Much like his new hero, Schneider's approval rating reportedly dropped over four points in the aftermath of his speech, down from 44%, although many liberals breathed a sigh of relief as the race for the Democratic nomination appears to be wide open. (you can always tell by the meme pages propping up #RFK2020, or whatever year it may be.)<br><br>John Lindsay may have died long before his musical went mainstream, but he can rest knowing that he isn't forgotten, and that he is continuing to make a great impact on the presidency 38 years after he left office.</span></p></div>`)

His arms are outstretched, palms up, bathed in the golden light of television history. The music swells, a marching band motif with a synthy cover.)<br><br>AGNEW (Matthews Rhys): “Now they tell me, Spiro, Spiro, you must answer for your crimes! Answer? <i>Answer?</i>”<br><br>(He pivots, pacing, placing his hand over his chest like a game show host. The audience is dead silent, breathless)<br><br>AGNEW: “My friends. I have already <i>answered</i>. I answered with every vote you cast for me. I answered with every cheer that rang through this hall. I answered the moment you let me get away with it.”<br><br>(A standing ovation ensues.)<br><br>This is not a <i>good</i> moment, morally speaking. It’s not a <i>good</i> moment politically, historically, or democratically. It’s a line ripped straight from the pages of a nightmare. A thesis statement from a campaign that, in reality, should have buried itself under the weight of its own corruption. But just like real life, Agnew wins. <br><br>There is something profoundly cursed about the fact that <i>Mr. Agnew</i> exists at all. That someone, somewhere, sat down and thought, <i>you know what Broadway is missing</i>? A <i>three-hour political spectacular about President Spiro Agnew turning his corruption trial into a fight</i>, and then actually convinced people to <b>pay money to see it</b>.<br><br>And the worst part? <i>It absolutely rules</i>.<br><br>Like, listen. I know. I KNOW. Spiro Agnew. bad guy. Enemy of all things good. Openly contemptuous of the press in ways that were not fashionable, but would later become a blueprint. But <i>Mr. Agnew</i>, the production, the spectacle, the phenom, is not about historical accuracy. It’s not even about President Agnew. It’s about a <i>character</i> named Spiro Agnew, a <i>performance</i> of Spiro Agnew, the version of him that exists only in televised Kennedy-era broadcasts, grainy news footage, and the garish, sweaty aesthetics of his own era. <br><br>It is Agnew <i>as he would have wanted to be seen</i>, a walking broadcast, a man whose entire personality is live in front of a studio audience, and in the show… he is. <br><br>Because <i>Mr. Agnew</i> is not a courtroom drama. <i>Mr. Agnew</i> is an election. A campaign stop. A debate that never ends, where the audience is forced into the role of delegates and voters, participating in a process that has already been decided. The prosecution presents their case, and Agnew, played with breathtaking, almost psychotic confidence by Matthew Rhys in the role of a lifetime, performs his way out of it. Not by disproving the allegations, but by turning into entertainment. A joke, a punchline, an alliterated one-liner. He doesn’t argue his innocence. He makes you cheer for his guilt. <br><br>And people do. They love it. Not because they like Agnew, but because the show understands the deep, hideous truth about this country’s politics. If you make a performance, they will clap.<br><br>Which is, obviously, why the Republican administration fucking hates it.<br><br>It is hilarious watching them try and denounce it, by the way. There have been press releases, actual press releases from the GOP, calling <i>Mr. Agnew</i> a “deliberate insult to the integrity of the American legal system,” which is rich coming from a party that just got out of a legal dispute over whether or not President Tancredo had the constitutional authority to use FEMA funds to commission a nationwide reprint of <i>Gone With the Wind</i> with a foreword written by himself. (The courts ruled against him, <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #551A8B;">prompting a week-long rant</span> delivered from Voice of America about the “erosion of cultural heritage.”)<br><br>But for a man who has a LOT to say, President Tancredo, who, I would like to remind everyone, ran on bringing back “Agnew-style” leadership and yet is extremely mad about how it looks in most forms of media, has been suspiciously quiet on the matter, though White House insiders claim he is deeply, personally offended by how the play portrays “one of our great presidents.” (this implies he went and saw it LOL). The Agnew Family has also released an official statement, calling it “a slanderous, grotesque misrepresentation” of the man who gave America eight ‘great’ years. <br><br>Matthew Rhys, for his part, does not seem bothered. When asked about the criticism, he simply smiled and said, “They should have cast me in the biopic instead.”<br><br>Speaking of which…<br><br>Because <i>Mr. Agnew</i> is not subtle. It is not satire. It is not even <i>critique</i>, not in the traditional sense. It is a gleeful, maximalist, neon-drenched spectacle that understands that politics has already become theatre, so why not lean in? Why not stage the corruption trial of a governor and president-to-be like a Super Bowl halftime show, complete with pyrotechnics, musical numbers on receiving a kickback in-office, and an actual, physical stage transformation when Agnew wins the case and the set morphs into the Oval Office?<br><br>Does the show <i>endorse</i> Agnewism? As if that matters. As if Agnew, in the world of the play, is a <i>man</i> and not a <i>brand</i>. Because the real horror of Mr. Agnew is not that the audience matters. It’s that it <i>doesn’t matter</i> if they love him or not. They still stand when he enters. They still laugh at the punchlines. They still vote when the play asks him to vote. The audience participates in his absolution, because <i>that is what they have been trained to do</i>.<br><br>And now, because nothing ever dies, because we are incapable of letting a single cultural moment remain on stage where it belongs…<br><br>Because if Broadway can have <i>Mr. Agnew</i>, then Republican Hollywood, in its infinite wisdom, must respond in kind. Enter <i><b>SPIRO: THE FINAL MAN</i></b>, a gritty, revisionist biopic that asks the question, <i>what if Agnew was the only man in Washington</i>? (He wasn’t but the film is deeply committed to pretending otherwise.) Directed by Sean McNamara and starring John Hamm in his most “my agent made me do this” role yet, the movie follows Agnew as a cigar-smoking, whiskey drinking, tough-talking crusader against “The System” (checks and balances). The script, <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #00AEEF;">if the leak by Anonymous is to be believed</span>, features at least one scene where Agnew personally fistfights a journalist outside of a Baltimore diner, which, I must stress, never happened, but does feel spiritually correct. The movie reportedly ends with a montage set to Johnny Cash’s <i>God’s Gonna Cut You Down</i>, because of course it does.<br><br>God Help us All. <br>Links To Other Articles by wawahwowah (Helly R.)<br><br>➡ Tancredo Staffer Resigns After Leaked Email Describes Mr. Agnew as “Historically Bad But Lowkey Hot” <br>➡ The Agnew Aesthetic: How 70s Reactionary Sleaze Has Become This Year’s Hottest Runway Trend<br>➡ Mr. Agnew’s Soundtrack is Unreasonably Good and I need to Talk About It<br>➡ I was a Bisexual Malkavian: how the VTM theatre-show saved me during the Bauer-era. <br>➡ Were These Two Characters in VTM Inspired by the Dynamic Between Presidents Agnew and Kennedy?</span></p></div>`)

And that game is called <i>BallotSnatchers.exe</i>.<br><br>[Jump cut to black screen with flashing red text: ‘IT IS THE FAULT OF THE DEADLOCK’]<br><br>The basic premise is you’re a ballot auditor trying to prevent the ascension of Nixon during the quote, <i><b>Third Recount</i></b>. Which sounds like satire, but isn’t, because, and I know everyone learns this in school, but Nixon did actually win in '72 through a deadlocked Electoral College after Congress melted down for 9 weeks.<br><br>[Cut to her holding up a whiteboard with squiggly arrows between dates]<br><br>Yeah. So RFK was president first, and he ran for re-election in ’72, but it was super close, and neither of them got to 270. So it went to the House. And Nixon won. And then RFK tried to do… some things…<br><br>[Cut to footage of President Kennedy outside the White House with a crowd of people]<br><br>He was just straight-up yelling outside the Capitol in a parka like ‘I’m the people’s mandate!’ and the press was like, ‘Sir, this is a Wendy’s.’”<br><br>[Overlay image: photoshopped RFK in a parka with a megaphone, caption: “#MandateMyAss”]<br><br>Anyway, he ran again in 1976 and Nixon absolutely demolished him. Like it wasn’t even close. It was a landslide. Nixon retired in 1981, died like 20 years later, and President Kennedy is still kicking around to this day, probably very salty.<br><br>So <i>BallotSnatchers.exe</i> is basically all of that but rewritten as this deeply broken isometric stealth game where you sneak into federal archives and throw spoiled ballots into a cartoon fire while avoiding Nixon clones. The game files used like, 13 separate WAVs from public domain footage. Oh! And a random ferret character named Bob who says ‘Habeas Corpus? I barely know her!’ Like. Why was everything in the early 2000s like this?<br><br>[Zoom in on bootleg plush of Bob the Ferret]<br><br>Okay, okay, it was made by one person. A 19-year-old from Vermont named ElectoralDagger who was a huge fan of that 70s play <i>Things That Never Were</i>, aka that really chaotic off-Broadway RFK-as-tragic-hero play that made every drama student in the '90s cry on stage once.”<br><br>[Overlay image: grainy VHS promo still of TTNW, with actor-RFK sobbing under a single spotlight]<br><br>Yeah. <i>That</i> play. <i>BallotSnatchers.exe</i> is, like, what happens when someone gets so mad at Richard Nixon they try to code their way into justice.<br><br>[Cut to game’s credits, where the line “In memory of the republic we deserved” fades across a waving American flag]<br><br>They wrote that with their whole chest. Like this was not satire. This was revenge art. There is a boss fight called <i><b>The Checkpoint of Procedural Betrayal</b></i>. There is a Nixon final form where his arms turn into gavels. It’s insane. I love it.<br><br>[Cut to her dramatically sipping a drink:]<br><br>Oh! And I cannot believe I forgot this—okay, so the game has a secret ending. If you find all the hidden electoral votes, you unlock a cutscene of Nixon and Kennedy just. Sitting together. In total silence. On a train. And the Nixon sprite says, ‘You remember Baltimore?’ and RFK says ‘I always do.’<br><br>And, um. There is a lot of fanfiction about that. I will not be linking it. But it exists. Just trust me.<br><br>The wildest part is there’s still people, like, every few years, who say that Nixon only won because of the '72 deal and that the deadlock was fake. Like there are message boards about this. There are zines. It’s a whole conspiracy rabbit hole. There’s also the theory that Nixon was a twin, and one of them was switched before the election, which is why he was evil.<br><br>[Screenshot of a forum thread titled “The Vote Was a Coup: RFK Had the Numbers” — user comment reads “anyone mention Richard Vixon yet?”]<br><br>Anyway, <i>BallotSnatchers.exe</i> was banned in a Swedish county and used in a civics class in Connecticut for a week before someone found the ferret. 9/10, should be in the Smithsonian.</p><br><strong>Top Comments</strong></div><div class="comment"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vqKSJ7H.png" alt="Profile"><div class="comment-content"><p><strong>@lesbianvixon</strong> <span style="color: #666; font-size: 0.9em;">1 day ago</span></p><p>RFK walking out of a snowstorm holding a pocket constitution was my gay awakening</p><div class="comment-footer"><span>👍 7k</span><span>👎</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reply</span></div><span>▼ 39 replies</span></div></div><div class="comment"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sk0nRnB.png" alt="Profile"><div class="comment-content"><p><strong>@fedlandia</strong> <span style="color: #666; font-size: 0.9em;">19 hours ago</span></p><p>my brother thought the ferret was real and cited it in a high school essay, we are not allowed to talk about it</p><div class="comment-footer"><span>👍 1.2k</span><span>👎</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reply</span></div><span>▼ 15 replies</span></div></div><div class="comment"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qBnw4ZF.png" alt="Profile"><div class="comment-content"><p><strong>@civicchthonic</strong> <span style="color: #666; font-size: 0.9em;">20 minutes ago</span></p><p>“WE STILL HAVE THE COUNT” is my ringtone!!!

                <u style="color:#6A6FFE">usmagazine.com</u><br><br><small style="color:#A2A2A2">By Eddie Spoto | March 12, 2006</small><br><br>Sorry to burst fans’ bubbles, but the Kennedy clan are <i>not</i> happy about <i>Tricky</i>. After its star, <b>Norbert Leo Butz</b>, who plays John F. Kennedy, told online theater news site BroadwayWorld that former President Robert Kennedy was “a minor figure,” the political dynasty is not holding back. Congressman Joseph P. Kennedy II (D-MA), and son of Robert Kennedy, released a statement calling Butz’s comments “outrageous” and “an insult to the 32 million Americans who elected him.”<br><br>The famously private former president hasn’t weighed in himself. Neither has his wife Ethel, though she frequently is seen as an elder stateswoman for the family itself, attending memorials, diplomatic summits, and more. Her husband has been keen to avoid the spotlight since his devastating loss to Richard Nixon in 1972.<br><br>Though former President Kennedy did wage a protracted legal battle against Seymour Hersh, for falsely claiming in a recent biography that the Commander-in-Chief was “suicidal” after his election loss, since the 2000 settlement, he’s been awfully quiet. If you listen to the political buzz, some say it’s because he’s getting ready to reclaim his crown in 2008, but a source close to the family dismissed that idea as “pure garbage.”<br><br>“Robert and Ethel are happily retired and have zero interest in returning to politics in any way. The work of their foundation is their driving goal,” the source added.<br><br>But the fact they’re picking fights with Broadway stars makes one wonder.<br><br><i>Tricky</i> has already drawn controversy of course, from Ed Nixon—brother of the former president—calling it “fairy dust” to generally mixed reviews from historians. Its creator, Stephen Schwarz, insists the goal was not to hew to real history whatsoever, but instead to evoke the men at the center of it. <br><br>“It’s about these two men, Jack and Dick, and how their tumultuous relationship played out in a national, really international, space,” he told <i>Vanity Fair</i> last fall. “They start out as enemies, they’re from opposite parties, but they quickly bond over their shared backgrounds. They both served in World War II, both were elected young, and eventually they wound up rooming together and becoming close, which is where we drew a lot of the early sections in Congress from.”<br><br>Of course the two men came from very different environments. Nixon was raised poor and couldn’t afford the Ivy Leagues, while Kennedy was a New England blue blood educated in Europe, but their fates did intersect in Congress. All of that is true, and that isn’t what historians and political experts take issue with, but Schwarz insists he was only following in the footsteps of another musical about the Kennedys: the obscure 1976 show <i>Things That Never Were</i>, which flopped upon release.<br><br>It’s just before the second act where <i>Tricky</i> defies reality, with Kennedy and Nixon taking the train to Las Vegas to meet Howard Hughes, the dying and reclusive man, who they believed to be a master of the dark arts—political dirty tricks or what Nixon called “ratfucking”—only to find out that he had been relying on J. Edgar Hoover this whole time. The two had watched Nixon grow and sought to make him the key to their power grab, but once Nixon found out, he was vilified, and took off for the Western skies to run for California governor.<br><br>So why did Butz spark a feud? Well, he said that Robert F. Kennedy’s role in the musical was “minor, just like his role in real life, a minor figure really.” In <i>Tricky</i>, he’s literally dropped into the land of DC by accident, accidentally setting off an investigation that destroys Bebe Rebozo’s fortune, enraging Nixon, who shouts at RFK: “Good God, I’ll get you you bastard, and your son-of-a-bitch brother too!”<br><br>Can you see now why <i>Tricky</i> has been as politically explosive as Keyes’ impeachment?<br><br>But regardless of all the controversies swirling it, <i>Tricky</i> has been a smash hit with Broadway audiences, still selling out week-to-week since its opening in 2003. Maybe the Kennedy family should start their own musical if they want to set the record straight.</span></p></div>`)

                Book Club: The Fan Fic Origins of “Veil of Secrecy”</h3><p><span style=\"color:#d6ced6;\">
                <b>RealJournal  • 08/10/2012</b><blockquote><span style=\"color:#d6ced6;\">“Going somewhere?” The president growled in a low, dark voice.<br><br>“Air.” I said, simply, afraid anything more would betray me. The green room suddenly felt small, constrained. He was so close. Too close. I could feel his body moving from the couch to somewhere behind me. His hot breath made my hair stand up on the back of my neck.<br><br>“Air,” he sneered. “Is that what you call it?”<br><br>A shiver went down my spine but I refused to turn. <br><br>“I’m talking to you, William.”<br><br>I made a move toward the door. Then, without warning, the man lunged, pushing me hard into the wall. I let out a cry of surprise. Loose flash cards fell to the floor. Talking points for the debate—all lost. <br><br><i>No. No. No.</i> I thought to myself. <i>Not now. Not after all our work. Not—.</i><br><br>“When I talk to you, I expect a response, William,” said the president. He had me pinned to the wall. He leaned in close. The smell of him, his musk, washed over me. “Do you understand?”<br><br>I let out a noise halfway between a cry and a whimper. His electric blue eyes bore into my own. He radiated power. I could see the rise and fall of his chest with each excited breath. Chest hair peeked through the taut fabric. <br><br>I gave one last attempt at resistance, knowing it was futile. “Let go.” <br><br>“Your dog gave more of a fight,” he said, his face so close to mine now. “Such a pretty thing… Such a pretty, pathetic thing… I was so sad to have to put it in its place.” He forced my chin upward with a flick of his thumb. “Are you a pretty thing, William? Do I have to put you in your place?”<br><br>A fire ignited inside me. My legs buckled. The anticipation was too much. <br><br>“Are you a good boy?”<br><br>I opened my mouth in time for his lips to plant themselves on mine. As my pants dropped and the commander-in-chief pressed his full weight onto me, I had but one thought—<i>Astrojet.</i></span></blockquote><span style=\"color:#d6ced6;\">***<br><br>So.<br><br>Uh.<br><br>If you are like me, you have probably been <i>really</i> confused by the runaway success of <i>The Veil of Secrecy</i>. Pop into any bookshop and you’ll see it everywhere. In the front window. On the display shelves. Up in the <i>Staff Picks</i>. Gone are the sci-fi YA and the gamut of forgettable detective novels. Occupying the top spot on seemingly <i>everyone</i>’s list is this new, strange novel decorated with two stars and red and white stripes.<br><br>For the longest time, I had no idea what this book was. I thought it might be a political thriller, a throwback to <span style="color:#2745B6;"><u>1960s paranoid conspiracy thrillers</span></u> that seem in vogue right now (see the “Manchurian Candidate” revival on ABC right now). Then, I started seeing it in the homes of pretty apolitical people—like my mother. That’s what got me curious. I wanted to know what had captured the cultural zeitgeist at a moment when, for most people, politics is more exhausting, divisive, and mean than it has ever been. <br><br>So I went to the Net. The first result, an <i>e-Britanica</i> listing, clued me in on what I’d been missing.<br><br><b><i>“Veil of Secrecy”</b> is a New York Times #1 best-selling erotic fiction paperback and e-book by British author E.L. James.</i><br><br>Erotic fiction? Well, that explains the popularity with housewives who dominate the book buying market. But what about the American flag? The stars? Clearly it’s a representation of the protagonists but is there some connection between them and the good ol’ stars and stripes? Was this a secret military tryst? <span style="color:#2745B6;"><u>Mayhaps two American soldiers</span></u> finding love on the battlefield? (Take your pick on the battlefield. God knows we’ve been involved in too many places over the last few decades.)<br><br><div style="width: 220px; height: 219px; overflow: hidden;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YcjrvNT.gif" style="width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;"></div><br><br><i>Set during a presidential election, the first installment in the series traces the deepening relationship between Mayor William Tort and the troubled and mysterious president, Gerald Fitz.</i><br><br>William Tort? Gerald Fitz? Why do those names sound vaguely familiar? I felt a creeping sensation on the back of my neck as I read on.<br><br><div style="width: 313px; height: 250px; overflow: hidden;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gXIsBG4.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;"></div><br><br><i>It is notable for its explicitly erotic scenes and the toxic, destructive relationship between its central characters.</i><br><br>Well, if that’s what gets your fires roaring…<br><br><div style="width: 300px; height: 274px; overflow: hidden;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/N71ZzGf.jpeg" style="width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;"></div><br><br><i>The first novel follows New York Mayor Tort as he campaigns against sitting president Fitz. Initially distant rivals, Tort’s decision to seek the presidency officially brings the two men into each other’s orbits. Over the course of an increasingly vicious campaign, the two men are irresistibly drawn toward each other, engaging in dirty tactics that hurt their families, friends, and one another.</i><br><br>Okay, this is starting to sound really familiar now… Like something I might have heard about in a history class…<br><br><i>The Veil of Secrecy series was developed from a “Things That Never Were” fan fiction originally titled “Master of the Universe” and published episodically through fan fiction periodicals.</i><br><br>Oh.<br><br>OH.<br><br>If you aren’t familiar, <span style="color:#2745B6;"><u><i>Things That Never Were</i></u></span> is a Broadway musical (yes, with showtunes) about the US Presidency. A very fictionalized version of the election of 1972, it tells the story of good ol’ President Bobby Kennedy seeking re-election and eventually failing due to hubris or ego or something like that. He’s fighting off against future president Sam Yorty, who is still a joke instead of <span style="color:#2745B6;"><u>an actual menace to civilized society</span></u>. Accusations get thrown. A dog gets killed. You know the drill. <br><br><div style="width: 290px; height: 218px; overflow: hidden;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9oakMq4.gif" style="width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;"></div><br><br>It’s notable mainly because it’s put on by a lot of high schools to try and get the kids interested in history. But that’s not what kids attach themselves to. If you’ve been on the Net at all, you’ll know that the <i>Things That Never Were</i> fandom—or Neverheads, as they call themselves—-love the musical because of its slashfic potential (something that’s been going on since the late 1970s. Only <i>Star Trek</i> predates it in that regard). <br><br>Don’t believe me? Search “<span style="color:#2745B6;">#TTNW</span>” on any blog site and you’ll be overwhelmed with a profusion of the most truly <i>heinous</i> depictions of presidential romance ever seen. Almost all of it unrelentingly toxic and abusive. Want Bobby Kennedy to <span style="color:#2745B6;"><u>get pegged</span></u> by a Klansman? There’s a fic for that. Want to see <span style="color:#681DA8;"><u>a vampire Bobby Kennedy licking blood off the head of future president John Connally</span></u>? There’s a fic for that. Want Bobby Kennedy to <span style="color:#2745B6;"><u>steadily poison Robert McNamara and nurse him back to health?</span></u> Do I have to say it?<br><br><i>“Veil of Secrecy”</i> is one of these with the serial numbers very gently filed off. Oy vey.<br><br><div style="width: 321px; height: 227px; overflow: hidden;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sgcXruw.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;"></div><br><br>Up until now, this is the kind of stuff that kept itself to the Net—occasionally <span style="color:#2745B6;"><u>shocking and confusing the uninitiated</span></u>. I suppose it was only a matter of time until the most popular fic pairing—-SamXBobby or Yortbert as shippers call it—wormed its way into the mainstream. I guess I just didn’t expect it to do so by dominating the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers’ list for weeks on end or for so many men and women to be infatuated with such a <i>nasty</i> little romance. It makes you wonder if Buchanan removing fluoride from the water supply had some unintended consequences.<br><br>But the weirdest thing of all is the possibility that Bobby himself is aware of all of this. Sam, mercifully, died a decade ago (though not before <span style="color:#2745B6;"><u>giving an insane interview about Wallace stealing the 76 Republican nomination, something that James allegedly used as the inspiration of her upcoming second book</span></u>), but 87-year-old Bobby Kennedy is still mouldering on the Kennedy Compound. He rarely goes out anymore and was <span style="color:#2745B6;"><u>completely absent</span></u> from this year’s nasty DNC, despite Giuliani citing him as a “major inspiration” in his nomination speech.<br><br><div style="width: 307px; height: 230px; overflow: hidden;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/afSckxE.jpeg" style="width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;"></div><br><br>Every so often, I see both Neverheads and James’s fans talking about tracking the old man down, subjecting him to their weird fantasies to validate them. The geezer could avoid it before. Now, with this dominating the publishing industry and a <span style="color:#2745B6;"><u>film series on the way</span></u>, it’s only a matter of time until a Boston Globe reporter asks him about it directly.<br><br>What do you think that does to a guy? What do you do when America’s lingering obsession with you is because they think you’re hot and brooding and mysterious? When no one remembers what you actually did in office but does want to know if you ever thought about fucking the guy that <span style="color:#2745B6;"><u>immediately declassified and released all your personal papers and spent four years trying to throw you in prison</span></u>?<br><br>I don’t know about Bobby, but if it were me, I think I’d take a trip down to Dallas and stand in front of a book depository. Nothing to do at that point except pray for the sweet release of death.</span></p></div>`)

He was a terrible mayor and a president so horrendous he got booted by his own party--twice. The only thing he could do well was talk. And talk he did. Constantly. If you ever wondered what a former president thinks about, say, Maria Callas (“I was once an opera singer, you know”), Pet Rocks (“Better rocks than dope, is what I say”), or Snoopy the Dog (“I don’t get it? Is the dog supposed to be funny?”), this is the show for you.<br><br>In terms of actual educational value, his best interviews were often not those with people he thought were important (the Wallace debacle, his Nixon interviews), which mainly serve as opportunities for Yorty to ramble about the issues of the day (civil rights, the re-invasion of Vietnam). His best interviews are those with performers who specialized in areas he knows little about. <br><br>The best example of this is his interview with Dean Jones on musical theatre and his upcoming production of Things That Never Were—a Broadway show about Robert F. Kennedy. While Yorty has no shortage of complaints about Kennedy (who was, at that time, still plotting a comeback for 1980 that would fail catastrophically), his lack of knowledge about theater gives Jones the opportunity to explain the aspects of Kennedy that have been fictionalized, the tragic nature of his presidency, and how Kennedy has come to embody how liberalism is often unwilling to defend core liberal ideas against baser impulses.<br><br>Then, of course, Yorty jumps in and asks Jones about his divorce and sends the man to tears. Sigh…<br><br>It’s about what you expect. Sam gets a lot of high-profile guests because of his former position but mainly uses the show as a way to get revenge or show off. If you want an actually enjoyable talk show run by a former president, you’re better off sticking with Jerry Springer.</div><div class="review-footer">👍 Helpful • 44   💬 12</div><div class="review-meta"><a>onepluspne</a> ・ Oct 22, 2019 ・ <a>Permalink</a></div></div></div><div class="user-reviews-section"><div class="section-header"><h2>FAQ <span class="count">16</span> ➤</h2></div><div class="faq-card"><a class="faq-question">How many seasons does The Sam Yorty Show have?</a><div class="faq-powered">Powered by Alexa 🔵</div></div><div class="faq-card"><a class="faq-question">Did Sam Yorty punch President Wallace on live television?</a></div><div class="faq-card"><a class="faq-question">Did Sam Yorty make Dean Jones drop out of Things That Never Were?</a></div><div class="faq-card"><a class="faq-question">How did Astrojet die?</a></div></div></p></div>`)

The production falsely portrays Sam Yorty as a bigot amid the Election of 1972, despite him having hired many Black people to serve in the City of Los Angeles Government. It also insinuates that he had a difficult and hostile relationship with his vice president, despite significant historical documentation that the two men had a strong and close relationship with one another. Other allegations—particularly regarding Sam’s intelligence—are simply not worth repeating. They are beneath the dignity of the Office of President.<br><br>The Samuel W. Yorty Institute and Sam Yorty Presidential Library have filed numerous lawsuits against this sham production over the years. Its continued production and its attempts to portray Former President Bobby Kennedy as a “tragic, doomed figure” who “could not surmount the petty grievances of the era” speak to the continued bias against mainstream America that infects the entertainment industry, despite the Yorty family’s decades of support for actors, producers, and other figures. Sam won the victory on his own terms. He was a vibrant public figure and commentator until his unfortunate death in 1998.<br><br>None of the same can be said about Bobby Kennedy who has, since his humiliating and decisive defeat, hidden in his Compound in Massachusetts. He has done little for everyday Americans except finance radical opponents to the Sam Agenda. Despite numerous, respectful attempts by the Samuel W. Yorty Institute to get the former president to condemn “Things That Never Were”, Kennedy has refused to do so. We take his silence as a shameful endorsement.<br><br>Rest assured, we will continue to explore all avenues to stop this latest revival and educate the American public about the true facts of the successful Sam Yorty Administration. We work with high schools around the country to stage productions of Sam’s own self-commissioned and celebrated stage show—”Play It Again, Sam”—and believe it provides an antidote to this grievous injury against the Yorty family’s reputation.<br><br>We hope this clarifies matters.

She envisioned a nation of lotus eaters, a place so absorbed with an imagined past and visions of supernatural heroes that it would be unable to avoid calamities to come. Shaken by these visions, she began collecting dreams from her friends and neighbors. <br><br>This collection, available again for the first time since 1983 in its writer’s native English, reveals the mass delirium that made America run toward the brink and over it. Across thirteen chapters, Hagen explores how a dying empire imposes itself on the subconscious and offers a raw look at how our dreamscapes can impact our lived reality.</p></body></html>

Initially, he gained prominence through his role in the 1965 coup that removed President Dương Văn Minh, a coup which, though ostensibly driven by domestic South Vietnamese military discontent, was conducted under the tacit approval and assistance of U.S. advisers. Since that time, Kỳ has held the post of Vice President, maintaining strong connections with the U.S. military establishment and gaining significant influence within the armed forces.<br><br>Kỳ's political ambitions, however, have been increasingly evident. This year, following the weakening of President Thiệu’s position, due in part to his failure to effectively address both domestic unrest and military setbacks, Kỳ engineered a political realignment that ultimately resulted in his replacement of Thiệu as President. Widely regarded as a \"cowboy\" and \"hooligan\" within Vietnam, Kỳ’s hardline ideological beliefs will set back any attempts to conduct negotiations with Hanoi, and his stance on a potential peace settlement is one of unyielding opposition to any form of compromise with the Communists. This has increasingly been at odds with U.S. efforts to seek any form of peace.<br><br>His policies, thus, will center on the continuation of aggressive military tactics, including increased reliance on U.S. bombing campaigns, search-and-destroy missions, and larger-scale operations aimed at suppressing Communist forces in the rural countryside. While Kỳ’s leadership may be less than ideal, it remains preferable to the alternative of an ungoverned, Communist-ruled Vietnam. To withdraw now would signal a retreat from our global responsibilities and would irreparably damage American credibility. A failure in Vietnam would send the signal that we are willing to abandon our commitments, emboldening Soviet and Chinese expansionism.<br><br>Personal Note to President Kennedy<br><br>I would be remiss if I did not make clear the absolutes of the decisions before us. Kỳ’s leadership will further complicate the delicate balance of power we have strived to maintain in that region, and our continued support of a regime under his rule, should it come to that, must be considered with the real and dangerous risks of entrenching us further in something we cannot handle. I urge you to continue to support South Vietnam militarily, but with the understanding that we must manage Kỳ’s leadership carefully and ensure that the broader strategy does not falter. It is a difficult balancing act, but it is one that we cannot afford to not do.<br><br>The cost of failure is not simply a matter of military defeat; it is the collapse of the international order, the loss of credibility for the United States, and the spread of Communist tyranny across the globe. This is the larger fight in which we are engaged, and it is one that we cannot afford to lose.</i><br><br>Respectfully,<br><br>Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.<br><br>National Security Advisor</p>" }

The Director, whose tenure at the Federal Bureau of Investigation has long surpassed the bounds of conventional public service, continues to engage in acts of political subterfuge that demand your immediate and sustained attention.<br><br>The Director’s opposition to your administration is not a matter of conjecture. It is evidenced by his deliberate dissemination of inflammatory rhetoric through trusted intermediaries on Capitol Hill and his enduring alliances with a network of conservative legislators, operatives, and media figures. These individuals, many of whom owe their political survival to Hoover’s patronage, have become vocal critics of your policies. The recent allegations of \"radicalism\" and \"destabilization\" that have emerged in the press are not spontaneous eruptions of dissent; they are the fruits of a calculated campaign orchestrated by Hoover to de-legitimize your presidency.<br><br>His methods, as always, are deniable. Leaks are funneled through back-channels. Rumors are planted with plausible distance from their source. But for a man who has spent his career exploiting the private lives of others, Mr. Hoover is conspicuously vulnerable to scrutiny of his own. His relationship with Associate Director Clyde Tolson has long been a subject of whispered speculation, yet it remains shielded from public examination by Hoover’s unrivaled command of the levers of fear and loyalty.<br><br>While their association is ostensibly professional, there exists compelling circumstantial evidence to suggest a deeper connection—one that may yet yield actionable leverage. Recent inquiries into their social habits, including their frequenting of exclusive dining establishments and private clubs, have uncovered inconsistencies in the public narrative surrounding their relationship. Should definitive proof emerge of conduct that contradicts Hoover’s carefully cultivated image, it would provide a powerful means of neutralizing his influence without resorting to direct confrontation.<br><br>It is not the intention of this office to engage in prurient or vindictive pursuits. The objective is to expose the hypocrisy of a man who has spent decades building a fortress of secrets while wielding those of others as instruments of control. Therefore, intensified surveillance of Hoover’s private and professional activities should be increased. This includes monitoring his communications, financial transactions, and social engagements. Care must be taken to ensure that these efforts remain entirely confidential and insulated from public disclosure.<br><br>Mr. President, the mantle of leadership that rests upon your shoulders is one borne by those who recognize the gravity of their moment and rise to meet it. The American presidency is not a refuge for caution, nor a sanctuary for complacency. You are no stranger to the fight against entrenched power. Your career, your victories, and your very presence in this office are a testament to your ability to face down forces that others deemed immovable.

Taylor, Director<br><br>DATE: June 10, 1970<br><br>SUBJECT: Pompidou, Gold, and the Future of Bretton Woods<br><br>EX. SUMMARY<br><br>President Georges Pompidou is pursuing a deliberate strategy aimed at reasserting French control over international monetary policy, a continuation of Charles de Gaulle’s efforts to undermine the Bretton Woods system. France remains committed to gold as a monetary cornerstone and deeply skeptical of the U.S. dollar’s dominance. While Pompidou has moderated de Gaulle’s antagonistic tone, his actions are no less destabilizing, posing a direct challenge to the credibility of American economic leadership.<br><br>Recent intelligence confirms that Pompidou is quietly accumulating gold reserves while pressuring allies to reconsider their reliance on the dollar. Pompidou’s strategy is pragmatic but rooted in Gaullist political nationalism, leveraging both symbolism and substance to bolster France’s geopolitical standing. His standing on monetary sovereignty is reflective of a broader aim: to reduce U.S. influence in European and global affairs.<br><br>Under President de Gaulle, France adopted an adversarial approach to Bretton Woods, challenging the dollar’s role as the global reserve currency. De Gaulle’s administration converted substantial dollar reserves into gold, citing a lack of faith in U.S. monetary policy. This move was both ideological and strategic, aimed at elevating France’s international standing. Since coming into power at the Élysée Palace, Pompidou has retained much of de Gaulle’s skepticism regarding the dollar but has tempered it with a technocrat’s understanding of global markets. His administration maintains France’s policy of accumulating gold reserves.<br><br>France has steadily increased its gold reserves, now holding approximately 4,300 metric tons—second only to the United States. Recent acquisitions, though modest, send a signal to international markets and reinforce France’s narrative of monetary prudence.<br><br>A conversation on May 24 between Secretary of State John Connally and President Pompidou displays the current state of U.S.-French monetary relations. It is as follows;<br><br>CONNALLY: “You’ve got a good thing going in the system as it is, Mr. President. The whole world does. But you start pulling threads on the dollar, and you’ll find the whole thing unravels faster than you think.”<br><br>POMPIDOU: “Monsieur Connally, France does not intend to rely on promises alone, nor shall we place our future in the hands of a printing press.”<br><br>CONNALLY: “With respect, Mr. President, you pull too hard on that thread, and you’ll be holding it alone.”<br><br>Pompidou offered no direct response but reportedly later described Connally’s demeanor as “intensely American”.<br><br>Ultimately, France views the dollar’s dominance as a structural imbalance that disproportionately benefits the United States. Pompidou has subtly encouraged European nations to adopt a more critical stance, advocating for greater reliance on gold and European currencies. French policymakers are intent on reducing their dependency on U.S. monetary decisions, which they perceive as reckless. This is evident in their ongoing gold accumulation and calls for tighter fiscal discipline from the United States. While Germany and the rest of the European Coal and Steel Community remains cautious, smaller nations have shown interest in diversifying reserves, aligning with France’s vision of a gold-centered system.<br><br>RECOMMENDATIONS<br><br>Covert assets within the Banque de France and French Ministry of Finance will provide insights into Pompidou’s gold strategy, including acquisition plans, international negotiations, and reserve management policies. France’s gold purchases and transfers must be monitored closely. This requires cooperation with allied intelligence services and the deployment of assets within international gold markets.<br><br>Key figures within Pompidou’s administration—particularly those involved in economic policy—should be identified and, where feasible, compromised. Personal vulnerabilities, financial irregularities, and illicit activities could provide leverage.<br><br>On the foreign relations front, public and private measures should also be taken to reaffirm confidence in the dollar. This includes disciplined monetary policy at home and strategic outreach to international stakeholders to emphasize U.S. commitment to global financial stability.<br><br>CONCLUSION<br><br>Mr. President,<br><br>There are moments when diplomacy, however well-meaning, reaches its natural limit.<br><br>France’s maneuvers are not just monetary in nature; they are a direct assault on the postwar order that the United States constructed and has led for nearly three decades. Bretton Woods was never merely a matter of financial policy. It was a declaration of intent: that the United States would stabilize the global economy, ensure prosperity for its allies, and contain the forces of disorder, whether they be Marxist dogma or nationalist provocateurs. Pompidou seeks to test the resilience of that system by cutting at its linchpin—the dollar.<br><br>This is not an isolated issue; it is a challenge to the very framework of American leadership. If Pompidou is allowed to succeed, if France’s campaign turns doubts into fractures, the repercussions will cascade far beyond the realm of finance. Allies will falter. Adversaries will pounce. The world will begin to wonder whether America is still willing to enforce the order it once demanded.<br><br>It is my firm belief that we cannot afford to allow him to set the pace or the terms of this confrontation. To outmaneuver him, we must know him—his plans, his weaknesses, his fears—before he even acts. The tools of the Agency are precise, proven, and indispensable. I urge you to deploy them without reservation.<br><br>Pompidou respects power, as all men of his stripe do. He does not respect hesitation.<br><br>Respectfully submitted,<br>Maxwell D. Taylor<br>Director of Central Intelligence</p>" }

Nelson Rockefeller announced his intention to seek the Republican nomination at a press conference a few nights ago. This wasn't unexpected, nor was his late entry into the race, becoming what will likely be the last major candidate to announce before the convention in a few months. Although a serious threat in the general election, his chances at the nomination must be deemed slim at best.<br><br>Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller has been campaigning for the presidency since virtually the day he was elected Governor of New York back in 1958. Considered a character of interest, and already a party leader in 1960, he openly sought his party's nomination in 1964, although character issues, plus the divorce of his wife and subsequent marriage to \"Happy\" Rockefeller turned him against the conservative roots of the Republican Party. -- many still angry abt today -- Despite this controversy, his credibility with the establishment of the party allowed him to mount a second, and perhaps more credible, campaign for the presidency in 1968. As you remember, there was quite a lot of fretting over the Gallup polls.<br><br>For the first time in many years, there is no truly \"obvious\" Republican candidate. Despite the whispers of some within his party, Richard Nixon is a figure of the past, -- see memo on RN's moves -- and many of the party's illustrious names like General Eisenhower are dead, thus the field appears to be more open than ever. This is to say that, despite his past difficulties with finding a base within the GOP, Republican voters can no longer look away from a candidate with such a strong electoral record, and general popularity amongst the American people. They have not won the presidency since 1956, who knows what they are willing to do.<br><br>I see no need to lecture you on his political positions, as you know the man well, but it should be said that his announcement speech took a far more confrontational approach to Vietnam compared to four years ago, and there's no doubt he'll continue to press on law and order as the campaign prolongs.</i><br><br>PRIVATE MEMO </p>" }

Charles Percy has announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination in 1972. Percy has served as Senator from the state of Illinois since 1966, and has been deemed by campaign internal polls, and independent analysis, as the man who may be the President’s chief opponent for re-election next November. The campaign should approach him directly, as a major threat.<br><br>Charles Percy -- campaign appears to be branding him as “Chuck” -- was first brought into the public eye when he was named one of the foremost “Young Men of The Year” in 1949 by Jaycees. Percy spent many years in the private sector, working his way through the business world until he was brought under the wing of former President Eisenhower and Gov. Nelson Rockefeller. Soon enough, he was encouraged to run for political office himself. In 1964, he ran for Illinois Governor, but narrowly lost -- shld note; outran Sen. Goldwater by large number. -- his race. Two years later, Percy upset long-time incumbent Democratic Senator Paul Douglas by over 10% of the vote. After his election to the Senate, Percy was heavily speculated as a candidate in 1968, but he supported Rockefeller.<br><br>Percy is a “moderate” Republican in the same mold as Rockefeller and Gov. Romney, and is likely at odds with many of his fellow presidential candidates, such as Governors Reagan and Agnew, whom he has taken to criticizing at times. Despite this, we remain Percy’s main target of attack. He has attacked the President as an “ineffectual” and “weak” leader. In his announcement speech, Percy focused on a large swath of issues, although he made intensive note of the “irresponsible” administration, and outlined his plan to bring “fiscal responsibility” back to the White House.<br><br>It is believed that Percy will benefit from the weakness of the Republican field, as well as a desire by the Republican establishment to consolidate around a single, strong candidate as early as possible. As long as the administration remains in the good graces of the public, Percy should remain on top of the Gallup polls in support. Failure to prepare for a Percy nomination could prove disastrous for re-election chances next Nov.</i><br><br>PRIVATE MEMO</p>" }

Barry Goldwater has announced his intention to enter various Republican primary contests. Although Mr. Goldwater himself has claimed this is only a move to procure support for conservative delegates across America, there's little doubt in our analysis that Goldwater is, openly, hoping that the nomination falls into his lap.<br><br>The elephant in the room for Goldwater, for all of his support in mainstream conservative circles, is the 1964 election. There are few men in America and even fewer Republicans who have forgotten the tumultuous summer of '64, Goldwater's aggressive and gaffe-ridden general election campaign against Lyndon Johnson, the image of that little girl cast behind nuclear Armageddon; there's zero doubt the trauma of that campaign will be a sticking point against the Senator from Arizona.<br><br>At a glance, Goldwater should be an extremely weak candidate. The supernatural affinity for putting his foot in his mouth has only grown stronger over the last eight years, and the arch-conservative has grown no more nuanced on the policy. -- Note; Goldwater opened announcement with a spontaneous attack on social security -- Perhaps his biggest weakness can be seen with Gov. Rockefeller and Sen. Percy's reaction to the Goldwater announcement; Rockefeller said in no uncertain terms that he would aggressively work to block any attempt to nominate his old rival, citing the 1964 campaign, Sen. Percy issued a simple statement saying there is virtually no way he could support a Goldwater nomination without significant concessions. -- Percy walkout? What could Goldwater offer? --<br><br>Although all of his weak points remain glaringly obvious, Goldwater has emerged from the rubble with new strengths, as the last true conservative fighter. Sen. Goldwater issued numerous statements approving of a Reagan candidacy throughout 1969 and 1970, although as Gov. Reagan began to tow a new line towards the \"electable positions,\" Goldwater found himself faced with calls by fellow conservatives to make a stand. While others like Reagan have fumbled through the Kennedy years, Goldwater appears to have been given a major boon. His public fights against administration policy in the Senate have delivered Sen. Goldwater a direct pipeline with the new \"conservative majority\" in America. The backlash against this White House has given Goldwater a second wind.<br><br>Goldwater's nomination would represent an unprecedented gamble by the Republican Party, but given their string of losses over the last decade, and the growing unrest against the status quo, we may need to approach him as a serious threat against this campaign.</i><br><br>PRIVATE MEMO</p>" }

Lindsay of New York City ahead of his anticipated campaign for the Republican nomination. It is the direct analysis of senior staff members that Lindsay's chances at becoming the GOP nominee are slim to none, but as it was personally demanded, I have gone through the trouble of putting this memo together. A former Congressman, and now the Mayor of New York City since 1966, there's no doubt he'd be a more dynamic force than many of his fellow Republican candidates.<br><br>Lindsay's candidacy is something of a paradox, as he seems to be equipped with stronger-than-usual support amongst groups that are not nominally Republican blocs. The youth, blacks, liberals, many of the same key constituencies that carried your campaign to the White House in 1968. With that in mind, plus his own political moderation, it'd be difficult to call him much of a front-runner in the Republican horse race, but his wit and charm is undeniable, even by conservatives. -- 2nd in recent Gallup poll -- It seems like many figures in the race, both declared and undeclared, are taking his campaign seriously. Gov. Reagan has already decided to use him as a pseudo \"stand-in\" for you, a test-round before the general election.<br><br>Another negative for the Lindsay campaign is his numerous political and personal enemies within New York politics, chief amongst them his cold relationship with Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, a likely candidate in his own right. Rockefeller has reportedly been pulling strings to knock Lindsay down as early as possible, as to prevent him from taking up the moderate lane for the nomination. -- Note; Could backfire on both? -- Reports suggest Rockefeller feels usurped, only made worse by the fact it's by a fellow New Yorker.<br><br>Despite this, many in the party feel as if he's the only one who can \"out-Kennedy\" a member of the family.

Although we had been tracking his moves, and such a campaign was heavily anticipated, his timing was unpredictable. Nothing better encapsulates the kind of campaign Agnew will be running; chaotic and uncouth.<br><br>Agnew is a man who can tell where the wind is blowing, and he's great at harnessing it to his advantage. Before he was a loud and outspoken voice for the conservative movement, Agnew was a restrained, moderate, and electable Republican voice who broke through Maryland, earning the black vote as he beat back a noted segregationist. Beginning in 1968, two years into his governorship, Agnew showed his true colors. Using the riots of the year in his favor, he gained national notoriety. Since then, he has gained a reputation as a \"Diet Wallace\" of some kind. In the last election, Agnew was an early supporter of Gov. Rockefeller's candidacy for the nomination, which fell short to Mr. Nixon. Afterward, he managed to snake his way onto the stage at the RNC as Mr. Nixon's running-mate.<br><br>That year, he spent quite a lot of time attacking Pres. (then Senator) Kennedy as a \"hyped-up hyper-liberal Hyannis Port rich kid\", while embellishing himself as an in-touch, working class, son-of-immigrants American. -- Will likely use again. -- Although he initially got the blame for Nixon's loss, and despite allegations swarming his administration in Maryland, Agnew managed to win re-election as Governor of Maryland by a healthy margin last year. -- Note: More than Reagan. --<br><br>Agnew joins an already large field of candidates hoping to take on the administration, and there are already worries that his tendency to run back and forth between his moderate and heavily conservative opinions may serve as an anchor against his nomination.

Reagan was written in August 1970, seemingly under the assumption he'd lose to Sec. Unruh, decided to update missing info.<br><br>Gov. Ronald Reagan of California has made an early start to the next campaign, announcing his presidential bid only months after the midterm elections. His 1970 re-election organization has been outfitted into an operation to take the White House, and he's already making moves to solicit key endorsements within his party. In 1969 this file on Reagan was commissioned, the first of many I've done thus far, which speaks to his power within the Republican Party. However, since then, the arch-conservative party leader has made his fair share of mistakes.<br><br>Although he scored a strong win against Sec. Unruh, his immediate decision to launch a presidential campaign encapsulates well his greatest weakness in the eyes of his Republican allies: an almost incomprehensible overconfidence. Being both a front-runner and the only major candidate for the nomination, Reagan almost immediately pelted with attacks from both Democrats and prospective Republican opponents. Governor Agnew told the press in Maryland he had no reaction to Reagan's announcement, exclaiming, \"I have a job to do, the job that the people of Maryland elected me to. Maybe [Governor] Reagan ought to look into that.\"<br><br>Although most chalk it all up to Reagan being in over his own head, it all may be a part of a larger strategy by his team to mend fences ahead of the primary contests. Over the course of his short political career, Reagan has gained a reputation as an extremely conservative firebrand, one who can even make Barry Goldwater blush with his gaffes. In 1970, and now with this next campaign, the Californian Governor has openly moderated on some rhetoric, hoping to play nice with a party deeply scared of losing another election. This has left him open to attacks from the right, which many potential opponents have gladly partaken in. This change hasn't been overwhelming, and in his first week on the campaign trail he openly pondered selling the TVA, and privatizing social security (if the chance were to arise, he said.) Even worse, his public stances on Vietnam only seem to grow more unpopular by the day.<br><br>Another point of concern is a potential alliance between Reagan and Gov. George Wallace, who, despite clearly harboring a certain distaste for Reagan, has suggested throwing his support behind the Governor of California wouldn't be close to impossible.<br><br>Still, even through it all, the decision to run an early campaign seems to have been a mistake for the Reagan campaign. Those old wounds with party leaders reportedly run deep. Even Richard Nixon, a Reagan ally, told reporters he was worried about what a general election with him as the candidate would look like. \"Well, you have to have a winner... a winner... someone strong and confident.

A spectacle. A slow-motion disaster for the party that will, in all likelihood, land him atop the ticket in Omaha.<br><br>And it is a ticket built entirely, almost pathologically, on opposing you. There is no principle guiding his campaign, no ideological foundation, no economic vision. There is only Yorty, pacing behind a podium, sneering into microphones, spitting insults about the \"Kennedy Machine\" with the deranged fervor of a man whose entire life has been reduced to a single, all-consuming vendetta. He does not care about the Republican Party. He does not even seem to care about winning. What he wants—what he needs—is to run against you.<br><br>What makes this particularly difficult is that Yorty is not an easy candidate to define. He is not a Goldwater Republican, nor a Nixon Republican, nor even a Wallace Republican (though that may soon change—more on that below). He is simply Sam: an opportunist, a showman, a man whose politics are dictated entirely by the need to stand at the center of the conversation. He was a left-wing New Dealer before he was an anti-communist. He was a liberal reformer before he was a law-and-order warrior. He was a Democrat before he became the Republican nominee. There is no guiding belief system beyond his own resentments.<br><br>And, crucially, he is good at this. He is not thoughtful, nor particularly coherent, but he knows how to entertain. He knows how to provoke, to turn press conferences into arena performances, to make himself impossible to ignore. <br><br>Yorty, as you know, remains the sitting Mayor of Los Angeles. His grip on city politics has been defined by precisely the same erratic, attention-hungry behavior that now defines his presidential bid. His tenure has been marked by open feuds with the press, wild accusations against his political enemies, and a total inability to resist the urge to grandstand. The city, meanwhile, is falling apart under him, though his supporters do not seem to notice. Or care.<br><br>On the ground, there is increasing concern that Yorty will select George Wallace as his running mate. It is not yet confirmed, but Wallace’s surrogates have been seen at multiple Yorty events, and the governor himself has been unusually complimentary in recent weeks. The problem is that the Republican Party is already reeling from the whole affair, and a Yorty-Wallace ticket would only accelerate the process. The donor class is horrified, and Representative McCloskey is holding private meetings about an independent alternative. But none of it matters unless someone actually stops him in Omaha. And as of today, no one has.<br><br>It is worth noting that while Yorty is a political lunatic, he is also a deeply strange man in ways that have little to do with politics. He loves mediating on the bathroom floor every morning, and adores his Dalmatian, Astrojet, more than he has ever seemed to adore a human being. He will spend entire campaign interviews scratching behind the dog’s ears, feeding him from a plate, talking to him like a confidant. His wife, Betts, is a different matter. She is camera-shy, awkward, meek and often out of place at campaign events. Yorty, however, enjoys parading her around the country and abroad. The exception to her character seems to be that dog, whom she dotes greatly on. The two seem made for each other, if anything.<br>Mr. President, I will be blunt. Yorty hates you. Not politically, not ideologically, but personally. It radiates off him in every speech, every interview, every moment he is on camera. It is the defining principle of his candidacy. You could announce a tax cut tomorrow, and Yorty would be against it. If you said the sky was blue, Yorty would gather his advisors to draft a statement in furious opposition.<br><br>His campaign is not a national conversation. It is an elaborate, deeply unhealthy one-sided argument with you. But the convention in Omaha will either confirm his control of the party or tear it apart trying to stop him. Our campaign should be prepared for both outcomes.<br><br>I will update you as Omaha approaches.</i><br><br>PRIVATE MEMO</p>" }

It has recently come to my attention — through old friends in the machine — that all of our prospective challengers have failed the smell test for conservative leaders, and as such, an insider plot is brewing to put one of their own on the ballot. There’s only one serious name popping up in these discussions, that of former Vice President Richard M. Nixon. (Note – Completely unconfirmed rumors; probably false)<br><br>There were always whispers of a third Nixon campaign, but by the time major names started announcing the effort seemed hopeless, and eventually Mr. Nixon openly declined to run for the Republican nomination only last September. Still, given his tenacity to plot in the dark, we’ve kept tabs on Nixon since his loss four years ago. In between television interviews, speaking opportunities, and legal work, the former Vice President has taken up a big role in the internal workings of the RNC, where he clearly hoped to have influence over whom the nominee would be this year — whether that was truly an effort to crown himself — or if he hoped to pass the baton to a younger member of the party is unclear, but what is obvious is his continued passion for the political process.<br>The ‘New’ New Nixon has finally landed on his role in public affairs; elder statesman. His snide comments towards administration policy in South Africa and Vietnam caused us some trouble a few months back. Mr. Nixon’s public persona can only be described as calculated, more scheming and thoughtful of his words and actions than ever before. There’s a new calm that comes with his politics, a fragile peace that threatens to break out at any moment — just as it did to a group of young hecklers during a live TV interview — when he shouted them down rather than the awkward shrugs of Nixon past. Behind his passive tones remain an insane man, clearly running to spite you more than much else.<br><br>Truth be told, we don’t see much of an electoral threat in Mr. Nixon, as he has been routinely rejected by the American people every time he’s been on the ballot since 1960. We beat him in 1968, even if it was close. His campaign — this year's — will be nothing more than a grocery list of personal and political grievances that he hopes to air out for the public to see, a way to get attention from those who don’t care otherwise. Nixon has never been a popular figure, and his worst traits that allowed Jack to beat him have only gotten worse. The most fragile ego you’ve ever seen, as the ‘Washington Post’ described him at a meeting with Sen. Bob Dole only last week. <br><br>Once again, I apologize for putting this on your desk, as our team agrees it’s <u>highly unlikely</u> that Mr. Nixon will be the nominee, even as he appears to be setting a trap for his Republican opponents as you read this, but it may prove important on the off-chance pigs begin to fly. <br><br>If you find yourself up against Richard Nixon, aim for the balls.

Our findings indicate that the key orchestrator of this activity is Clifford Michael Irving, an author and self-appointed intermediary who has now expanded his role to that of campaign surrogate, strategist, and, in all practical terms, the man leading the Republican ticket.<br><br>You may recall Mr. Irving's name from the Hughes autobiography published last year. An alleged firsthand account that remains, despite every reasonable doubt, widely believed. The book has transformed Hughes into something mythic: a messianic capitalist recluse, a billionaire turned prophet, an architect of destiny. Irving, who wrote it, has now leveraged that myth into something even stranger. He claims to be Hughes’s closest aide, his only true conduit to the outside world. People believed him.<br><br>Upon his return from Switzerland in January, Irving began laying the groundwork for this campaign, dropping Hughes’s name into conversations with party officials, political financiers, and the press, constructing a narrative in which Hughes is the only man who can ‘save the country’ from the ‘morass of Washington.’<br><br>Our investigation suggests he has spent the last two months embedding himself within various Republican networks, forging connections with disillusioned Goldwater-era donors, stealing internal RNC messaging, and, in some cases, outright lifting strategy documents from their private offices. We suspect Irving has copied confidential donor lists, stolen polling information, and—most audaciously—hijacked state-level organizing structures meant for the eventual Republican nominee.<br><br>Polling from the last three weeks suggests that a Hughes candidacy has cut deeply into the Republican electorate. In states where Irving has been most active, California, Nevada, Texas, Hughes is polling at nearly 48%. Republican officials, already struggling to mount a serious challenge to your reelection, are reportedly going \"all in\" on his candidacy. The RNC has no idea how to counter a candidate who may or may not even be running. Worse, they don’t know if they’re running against him or for him.<br><br>We know he is lying. We know Hughes is not involved in any formal way. But we cannot prove it. Not yet.<br><br>Intelligence review of media outlets suggests a coordinated effort to lend legitimacy to the campaign, despite no verified participation from Hughes. Op-eds and televised debates increasingly frame Hughes as a serious political figure, rather than a fugitive from his own existence.<br><br>Furthermore, this office has no confirmed sightings of Howard Hughes outside of controlled environments since 1968. Reports continue to place him at multiple locations within Nevada, with secondary intelligence suggesting he has not left the upper floors of certain private properties in years. Our best source suggests he is in one of his Las Vegas properties, possibly the Desert Inn or the Sands, but we cannot say for certain. What we do know is that he is physically and mentally deteriorating. Reports from our source describes him as unrecognizable, emaciated, erratic, refusing to allow anyone in his presence without surgical masks and gloves, consumed by obsessive rituals, unwilling or unable to engage in direct conversation.<br><br>We have confirmed that Hughes’s associates have planted decoys—impostors, hired men who resemble him just enough to keep the press chasing ghosts. These false Hugheses have been seen leaving casinos in the dead of night, dining in private rooms at exclusive clubs, checking into penthouse suites before vanishing by morning. These men have been strategically placed in key locations to throw off investigators, journalists, and, we suspect, even Hughes’s own former allies.<br><br>But the real Hughes does not leave his suite. The real Hughes does not speak. And yet, we have received multiple accounts from those who have seen something. A figure at a window, bone-thin, covered in hair, watching, unblinking. A glimpse of something unwell. <br><br>There are perhaps five or six people, not including us, living who truly know what is happening with Hughes. Irving is not one of them.<br><br>Mr. President, I am advising immediate, full-scale action. This is beyond a campaign fraud case. It is beyond an election anomaly. What is happening is destabilizing, surreal, and, I believe, dangerous. We believe the Bureau should begin the following steps:<br><br>Locating Irving. We currently believe he is operating out of Los Angeles, though he has been seen in New York and Miami in recent weeks. We have assigned personnel to track his movements and identify his network. We will also begin investigating precisely how Irving accessed Republican strategy materials and donor information. If he has inside help, we will find it.<br><br>Assessing how much Hughes actually knows. Direct contact with Hughes is likely impossible, we are monitoring his aides and legal representatives. If there is even a trace of real involvement, we need to know.<br><br>Neutralizing the Hughes Campaign. Irving’s operation cannot be allowed to continue unimpeded. Every tool available to the Bureau must be used to disrupt and dismantle this movement before it reaches an irreversible momentum.<br><br>We will continue to monitor and act where we can. But I would strongly advise preparing for the reality—however impossible it seems—that Howard Hughes may not only appear on a ballot this fall but may win. And I do not believe anyone—least of all Hughes himself—knows what happens after that.<br><br>The Bureau remains committed to ensuring the continued function of lawful democratic processes and will escalate efforts accordingly. Immediate authorization of expanded operations is requested.<br><br>A full updated intelligence report will be provided in 72 hours.</i><br><br>Yours,<br>Leo Cherne<br>Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation</p>" }
