Frank Church had long since grown used to this fact after twenty years in the United States Senate, he was more than used to seeing a freshman class of Congressmen sworn in every two years in the snow blanketed capital, staff rushing across the streets and towards the Capitol building so they can claim a half-decent office before some other bum fresh-eyed wet-behind-the-ear first-termer takes it. He could only look back fondly on his own early days, when it all seemed much simpler.<br><br>Every four years come January is a different story, when even the most burrowed politicians can’t escape the whirlwind of drunken rumors, secret meetings, and punditry over whatever ghoulish figure is preparing to take the White House this time. It was, of course, better when it was your own party. Church noted the mood in camp Democrat in the Senate to be a great deal brighter than his friends across the aisle, where he only found a solemn and dull Barry Goldwater sitting in the dark while Howard Baker plotted on how he’d flip a Humphrey presidency into his own fortune come the ever present “<i>next time</i>.”<br><br>It was all anyone seemed to be worried about in this line of work. He looked on as Walter Mondale and Adlai Stevenson, two members of the Humphrey Inauguration Committee, walked across the salted street, smiling joyfully. Of course Mondale was smiling, Church mused, he was next in line for the top job “<i>next time</i>.” <br><br>It was an open secret in D.C. that a Humphrey administration could not possibly last more than four years, and that it may not get to January 1981 in the first place. Therefor, anyone taking jobs or affiliating themselves with the sickly incoming President Humphrey must be working to further their own career, to prepare for that abhorrent “<i>next time</i>.” <br><br>He grimaced at the thought, walking faster to catch up to his two Democratic colleagues. Frank Church, obviously, wasn’t above blatant careerism. He had spent his earliest years in the chamber trying not to step on the toes of Lyndon Johnson, he had gone to war with the intelligence establishment, with the whispers that it’d be him preparing to take office later this month. However, that was it. His <i>next time</i> in the past now, the hopes and dreams of a Church presidency that he had so longed for since he was young and looked up at beautiful pictures of his idols such as Franklin Roosevelt and William Borah, those who really made the difference.<br><br>The Senator from Idaho would be lying if he said it wasn’t a nasty feeling—what with that mess at the convention—it had been taken right from under his nose. Not only the presidency, but so much more. Walter Mondale had (in his kindest words) gave Church the word bluntly. There could be intelligence reform in the Humphrey term, but it’d be nowhere as broad or as deep as Church had been planning for his own administration. “The <i>President-Elect</i> wants to tackle the bigger issues.” The administration’s would-be chief ally in the Senate said, shaking his head. Unemployment, the Middle East, agriculture—where Church’s much maligned rival, <i>Vice President-elect</i> Jimmy Carter, would be taking his focus—there was simply no time for a massive intelligence reform bill. <br><br>“Don’t be worried, Frank, we’ve been working with Jerry Ford on a handful of smaller reforms.” Humphrey assured the unusually quiet Church only a few days ago, before inviting him to join the Inauguration Committee. <br><br>It was enough to make him sick.</p>`)

  e.pages.push(`<h3>ZR/RIFLE</h3><p>With each swing of the door, the whole barroom shivered. A gale force wind blasted through this old Minneapolis speakeasy, plunging the inside temperature down to what it was outside: somewhere between zero and the Arctic tundras. If you sat close enough to the entrance, every time a new patron came into the relative warmth, you could even see your own breath.<br><br>That is precisely why Walter Mondale sat as far from the door as he possibly could. Nursing a bottle of rum, the Minnesota Senator was not yet 50 and already looked as if he had aged a thousand years. <i>That’s what losing will do to anyone</i>, he thought grimly. The Senator took another swig. Gathered around this funeral affair were a handful of political operatives and old party hands, who all thought their man would finally make it over the top this time. That maybe this year, old Hubert had it in him. They were all sorely mistaken.<br><br>Huddling for warmth, even next to the raging fireplace by their feet, these men drank. And drank. And drank some more. Mondale was never as much a prisoner of the bottle as many of his colleagues in the U.S. Senate were. He had heard enough stories about them to last a lifetime. <br><br>Not a soul present that day would forget when Lyndon Johnson had raced from the floor of the Senate, as the George substitute to the Bricker amendment hung in the balance, only to find that Harvey Kilgore of West Virginia had fallen asleep in his office after another bender. Literally dragging the hungover final vote to the floor, Johnson successfully killed that amendment. It was an old tale Humphrey loved to entertain his friends with. <br><br>Thinking about him just made Mondale clutch the rum tighter. It wasn’t just that Hubert had lost. Mondale had seen that plenty of times. And every time, the old warrior would get back up with a smile and hop back into the next race, as energized as ever. But not this time. Not after those painful nights in the hospital, watching Hubert’s very energy drain from his now-frail body, drip by drip, into a tube keeping him alive. <br><br>Mondale winced at the thought. Maybe Ford would be better this time. Maybe. He still fumed about the pardon, but even Fritz would concede the President had done a herculean job uniting the country after the bitter scars of Watergate. It wasn’t that the Senator was horrified at the prospect of another term by Gerald Ford. It was what lay ahead, in 1980, that worried him most. Mondale knew he’d be a top contender, if the stain of this loss had washed away by then. If not, maybe Bayh or Kennedy, or someone totally new, maybe one of those Watergate Babies. <br><br>It was a nice fantasy. Mondale knew where it would inevitably land. He had run away from his fate this cycle, said some cheap line about not wanting to sleep in Holiday Inns every night. But he winced the moment the words left his mouth. He knew what the press would all say. <i>Would Lincoln have shirked his duties like that? Did Roosevelt turn away from the siren call because he was tired of rubber chicken dinners? Had the thought even occurred to Kennedy that the mild inconveniences of a campaign dissuade him from serving his nation?</i> What hurt most was that they were all right. Mondale knew he had run like a coward when his country needed him. Had he been the nominee instead of Hubert…<br><br>Mondale let the thought linger there. He didn’t dare come to the same conclusion everyone else at the table had. But next time it would be different. He was sure of it.</p>`)

He always went for runs around Washington before dawn, the mistier and emptier the better, but this was no ordinary day. He had been up all night celebrating the election of one of his idols in the Senate. Hart was practically a stranger to the institution, not at all suited to its backslapping boy’s club ways, but neither was Senator Church, who Hart grew to admire during their work on the Church Committee together. Spending countless hours poring over dusty boxes overflowing with old CIA documents will do that to you.</p><p>As Hart jogged past the endless Georgetown houses, he began to reflect on the last decade. While he was still at the low level in the Interior Department, he watched from the inside as the government was torn apart by the war in Vietnam, with protests thronging the gates of the White House day and night. After the chaos of Chicago and the traumas of ‘68, Hart watched as a South Dakota Senator named George McGovern reorganized the entire method of nominating a President, returning the power to the people, away from the smoke-filled rooms of the 19th century.</p><p>Hart was indebted to the man, after all, McGovern had tapped him to run his campaign when few others would, but it was painful for him to think about the litany of mistakes they had made, and how badly out of touch they were with an electorate more concerned about rising prices than a war winding down overseas. Then when a new national nightmare threatened to tear open the barely-healed national wounds once more, Hart ran for Senate himself as a reformer, arguing for a new era of transparency and accountability, out of the muck of Watergate. He was rewarded for it, the voters of Colorado sending him off to the Senate, where he would work with Church to bring about that very era.</p><p>Hart had had a minimal role in the ‘76 campaign, but he argued passionately for Church’s election throughout the country, taking those winding trips in the old campaign buses through snow-covered towns and windy desert hills. It wasn’t out of party loyalty, Hart cared little for that. It was because for once, Hart genuinely believed in a politician’s morals, and equally important, in their ability to implement them into actual policy. Church was as human as anyone, but Hart would feel safe living under his administration, knowing the White House wouldn’t drive itself into a state of paranoia or foolishly charge into any more unnecessary wars.</p><p>As the sun rose over Washington, Hart felt genuinely hopeful. It hadn’t even been a close election, after all the griping from the pundits. Hell, it had been a landslide, something to rival Nixon’s four years ago. Ford may have been a decent man, but he was totally over his own head. Hart couldn’t say the same about Church, who had won re-election time and time again in the most conservative of states, without ever straying from his own moral compass, as so many of their colleagues had. Stopping to catch his breath on a DC street corner, Hart couldn’t help himself from laughing at the irony of it all. Despite the TV jingles and the magazine advertisements, it wasn’t Ford who had made him proud again, it was Frank Church.</p>`)

  e.pages.push(`<h3>AM/VELVET</h3><p>The salty breeze from the San Francisco Bay that Jim Jones had always treasured since moving out West felt more like a punch to the gut today. Just one more reminder that the charismatic preacher was living under what he believed was transforming into a military dictatorship. He had delivered countless red-faced sermons, shouting to his mostly Black congregants that they were one step away from being sent to the camps, but his closest aides always questioned behind closed-doors whether Jones <i>actually</i> believed any of that, or if it was just an effective propaganda tool. But today, it made no difference.</p><p>Last night, Jones had watched in horror as the devil in a white suit picked up state after state, extending his reach from coast-to-coast, sweeping the cities and the heartland. The regime media all babbled about how this was “a bit of a disappointment” for Frank Church, who apparently had been telling his media plants that he was set to win 49 states, but Jones knew this was all talk, mere propaganda from the modern Hitler. What chilled Jones most was that some of his followers had undoubtedly voted for that demon. </p><p>Frank Church. Jones stewed in rage thinking about him. The man promised “oversight” of the same intelligence agencies his followers feared most. The ones always coming after the People’s Temple. Sending their private cutouts to run to the media, calling their movement a “cult,” screaming for their children, demanding it all be broken up. But Jones saw how Church talked. He spoke passionately against what he called “demagogues” who were “determined to pit Americans against each other with their divide-and-rule strategy.” Jones took that as a direct attack on his character.</p><p>Earlier this morning, Jones reached out to the Temple’s lead attorney, Gene Chaikin, to see about fleeing to Cuba. As Jones proudly recited to all those who would listen to him—and everyone did—the preacher had visited Cuba “in the throes of revolution” and praised Fidel Castro as a hero of the 21st century. Now Jones was gambling that that flattery would pay off. Perhaps his Temple could migrate there. Or more importantly, Jones alone. Shipping off to the island in the middle of the night, faking his death. Anything to avoid Church’s wandering eyes. He knew where those investigations of the “intelligence community” would lead. He had only avoided the glare of the Church Committee by pure luck. But with that man seated in the Oval Office? Everything would be dug up.</p><p>Laurence Layton. Project Bluebird. Dan Mitrione. Project Artichoke. Jolly West. Brazil. Dan Mitrione.</p><p>Jones was the only man alive who knew the meaning of this tangled web of obscure names and government operations. He had seen to it that the others involved had been buried six feet under. Now he was all that was left. Cuba was the last remaining refuge.</p><p>A knock at the door. Jones turned and Chaikin poked his head in.</p><p>“Just updating you on that Havana contact, Reverend,” Chaikin said matter-of-factly, as if he was describing the weather, “Castro says he won’t take you.”</p><p>The news knocked the wind out of Jones. The room spun. His head throbbed. Jones had treated that bearded bastard like a son. Now Castro had stabbed him in the heart. There had to be somewhere else to migrate to. There had to be.</p><p>“Sorry, Reverend,” Chaikin butted in, “but do you have anyone else you’d like me to contact?”</p><p>Slowly a revelation struck Jones. It was as if he had been blessed in that moment with a vision of what was to come. Of the deliverance from evil his Temple had sought. Turning to Chaikin, Jones spoke slowly and deliberately.</p><p>“I want you to dial this number,” Jones instructed Chaikin, scribbling the sequence down on a stray notecard before handing it to his follower.</p><p>Chaikin looked at it confused. Predicting his response, Jones told him it was a man who would know who he is.</p><p>“Tell him AM/VELVET is calling, requesting Operation Prairie Fire. He’ll understand.”</p><p>Jones’ lawyer nodded, though still as baffled as ever. But he’d do as he was told. They all would. Even James Adkins, the CIA Station Chief in Guyana, would follow Jones’ command once Chaikin relayed the order. Finally he would be given a secure passage to his South American paradise. To see his newly established colony up close. Free of persecution from his enemies within. Only then would the People’s Temple ascend to its highest calling.</p>`)

  e.pages.push(`<h3>PB/PRIME</h3><p>Inside the glittering ballroom of the Sheraton Hotel, all Washington’s chattering class could gossip about was who was seated at the table closest to the stage. They traded furtive glances in-between second go-arounds at the caviar. Could it be? Was <i>this</i> man finally leaving his office to go and…socialize? It was as if something had defied human nature. Defied even God’s will. The very thought of him sitting there, watching these stale skits about moonshine, or that two-bit comedian imitating drunken husbands returning home to their wives, why it was simply unthinkable. But there he was. <br><br>Robert Carlyle Byrd never was one to attend these galas. He never indulged in the stripteases or booze-filled clubby nights on the town his colleagues did. In his quarter century on the Hill, he has attended three baseball games—two of them were on the same day, a double header—one football game—he had to crown the Queen at halftime—and one film, which he walked out on halfway through. When Ted Kennedy left his spot as Majority Whip for a weekend to go skiing, Byrd schemed to throw him off his post, lock down the votes to take the job for himself, and won. When Kennedy returned, he found himself stripped of his titles.<br><br>Now Byrd found himself in a similar spot. He scowled at the tawdry acts on stage. He permitted himself to eavesdrop on the hushed conversations surrounding him, if only to get a sense of chemistry. To identify his colleagues’ weak spots. To sense where they expected him to fall. Oh he heard them alright. Hart and Leahy and Bumpers. They were nothing but children, Byrd thought with a curl of the lip. Babies, really. That’s what the press kept calling them after all. <br><br>Hell, the President-elect was no different. Another pious man trying to shake up the system. Bullshit, Byrd thought. He had spent every day of his life building this system. Church talked about serving in war. Byrd welded the ships that took him to China with his own bare hands. They were all walking around the world Robert Byrd created. They didn’t do a goddamn thing. <br><br>To hear Church sit there and lecture him, after barely winning, about “the way this is going to be” made Byrd want to scream. But he didn’t have to. He wasn’t enough of a child to lash out that way. No. He sat. And he stewed. And he schemed. Oh lord, did he scheme, Byrd thought with a smile creeping across his face. It didn’t hurt that his enemies made it so damn easy. It was as simple as moving around pieces on a chessboard, but even if they were Lyndon Johnson and Sam Rayburn themselves, Byrd would outwork them anyway.<br><br>He watched the moronic emcee onstage say something about what a “great honor it is to welcome” Byrd to this event. The Majority Whip only sighed, stood up, turned to face the applauding crowd with a grimace, then walked up to shake the man’s hand. Byrd took his prepared speech out of his suit jacket. The perfunctory verbal nods of thanks at his hosts. He could hardly remember which of those organizations was hosting the dinner. Not that he cared.<br><br>Byrd sighed, and began to read the text he had prepared. “I’d like to talk to you about what I believe our most pressing national crisis is,” he intoned. “It’s crime.” A deafening silence fell over the crowd. Byrd could detect a few chortles from the tables near the back. The whispering made him grit his teeth. Not just at what he was saying, but how he was saying it. “Crahm,” he could pick up someone chuckling to the woman next to them, imitating the way he spoke.<br><br>Byrd closed his eyes for a moment, folded his prepared speech up, and tucked it back away. He wasn’t going to read what his secretary had typed the night before. He was going to speak directly to these ungrateful buffoons. <br><br>“The proliferation of crime all across our country can be largely attributed to one fact: there is so little punishment for it.” More silence, then a far away cough. “The best way—and perhaps the only way—to halt the crime wave that has been getting worse and worse is to take those criminals, those animals, and instead of locking them up, we need to be putting them six feet under.” Byrd’s voice rose. “And for the ones we slap on the wrist, for the ones we don’t even bother to book and charge, I say that it is better to build more prisons and hire more jailers than it is to allow American cities to deteriorate further into racial jungles.” A few scattered claps, Byrd noticed, from the usual old timers, like Eastland with his bottle of bourbon, but also some of the younger cohort. Byrd smirked. He was winning them over at last. Now he would twist the knife.<br><br>“So when I hear our <i>President-elect</i>,” Byrd annunciated slowly, drawing out every vowel in ‘president,’ “talk about <i>crahm</i>, while he’s out there swimming in the Gulf Coast, I think each and every one of us ought to be crystal clear about how serious a national emergency this is. This isn’t something you can sleep through.” The applause was louder this time. “You can’t talk to a couple’a <i>magazine</i> writers and talk tough, then go out there <i>fishin</i>’ back home in Idaho.” Some of the Southerners were cheering now. But this wasn’t just a Good Ole Boys rally, this was something different. <br><br>“Church says he wants to ‘change how things are done in this town,’ well let me tell you this, <i>Senator</i>,” Byrd hissed. “I have never in my life played a game of cards. I have never in my life had a golf club in my hand. I have never in life hit a tennis ball. I have never thrown a line over to catch a fish. I don't do <i>any</i> of those things. I have only had to work all my life.” The cheering was overpowering his speech now. He could feel it in his bones. At last, he had awakened these recalcitrant members of the Congress back to life. They had been pushed around by too many Presidents to take it one more time. Especially not from one of their own.<br><br>“And every time you told me about swimming, I don't know how to swim!” Byrd finished. The room exploded into gales of laughter and applause. The last few old Southerners leapt to their feet to cheer him on for protecting their way of life. The liberals of Kennedy and Johnson’s classes shook their heads and crossed their arms. But Byrd kept his eyes trained on the young ones. The new blood. Every single one of them stood up and applauded. Byrd smirked and shook his head. He had them wrapped around his fingers. With a final nod to the crowd, the Senator from West Virginia walked offstage, put on his coat, headed out the backdoor, and went to work.</p>`)

Washington was a mess in early ‘77, and the freshman Congressman from Indiana was loving every second of it. Dan Quayle wouldn’t have to worry about all the complicated rules that came with a deadlocked election, that would be left to smart fellas like James Rhodes and Tip O’Neil, Bobby Byrd and Howard Baker. That didn’t mean he wouldn’t try to be involved.</p><p>And thank God it wasn’t. Quayle had already assured his constituents in central Indiana that the House of Representatives <i>would</i> come to their senses and elect Jerry Ford for another term. He doubled down further when told by House Majority Leader Jim Wright that Church was “certainly” going to be elevated to the White House by Congressional Democrats. Dan Quayle saw right through that trickery. He scowled, swearing to make sure that his President <i>would</i> get the respect he deserved.</p><p>He suddenly stopped, frightened by a loud noise from his side, a honk. “<i>Hey! Watch where you’re fucking going!</i>” Quayle looked at the driver bug-eyed, holding out an unsure hand before rushing across the street. Fixing his coat, Quayle scoffed. They really ought to have for respect for a real <i>living Congressman.</i></p><p>“You’d better watch out, Danny Quayle, that one nearly ‘gotcha.” He heard a chortle, looking up to see a fellow freshman Republican, Newt Gingrich of Georgia. Quayle didn’t think too much of the chubby rising star who broke through the Solid South, having met only once before the week prior when he first arrived in Washington, and he only viewed the Georgian as a power-hungry bully who thought he was going to be the next big thing. Dan Quayle was sure he was smarter than Newt, and <i>he</i>, not Gingrich, was going to be <i>the next big thing</i>. </p><p>“I guess I was just thinking too hard.” Quayle said, shaking his head. “These guys like <i>Mr.</i> Rhodes and <i>Mr.</i> Michel have completely given up on <i>President</i> Ford. Can you believe it? I mean, we won the election. They said it was going to be a wipe out, and you know that, Newt. <i>President</i> Ford can still win, and we can get him across the line in Congress.” The Hoosier said profoundly, as if his words would hold their own place in history.</p><p>Newt only let out a small tsk, putting his arm around Quayle’s shoulder. “You’ve got to think of the bigger picture, Dan. I want Jerry Ford to win re-election as much as the next guy, but if he barely wins this off of Congress, and the next four years go on like this, we’re fucking screwed in ‘78 and ‘80!” He explained slowly, as if it otherwise wouldn’t get through to Quayle. “But… if Church gets through… you know. He underperformed expectations. Dems lost seats in both chambers. If he gets his radical agenda through, we have some bright hope for the next few cycles.”</p><p>Dan Quayle blinked. That made enough sense. “But still, Newt, It’s the right thi—”</p><p>“<i>Winning</i> is the right thing to do. We can have the mandate for a generation if we give up on Ford. We can have Reagan in ‘80. We can have Kemp in ‘80. We can have <i>Gingrich</i> in ‘80.” The last one went unsaid by Newt, not that Quayle would’ve picked up on it. “Don’t you have high ambitions too, Dan?” Gingrich asked with a smirk.</p><p>“Oh, well, of course I do!” Quayle said, eyes fixated on the sidewalk nervously.</p><p>Newt only snickered, grabbing Quayle’s shoulder again to stop him from walking into oncoming traffic. “It’s an awfully big city compared to where we’re from.” The Congressman from Georgia said sympathetically. “<i>Heh</i>, I imagine someone like Birch Bayh will look mighty fragile after four years of Frank Church…” He said, trailing off as a new light flickered into Quayle’s eyes.</p><p>“Huh. I didn’t even think of it that way.” The Hoosier said, dumbfounded.</p><p>Newt only smiled. “No. No you didn’t.”</p>`)

She pursed her lips, “I just couldn’t handle Wirthlin’s calls for another minute.

It was an affront to his intelligence.</p><p>Ryan pitied the man he ran against. The California Congressman was hardly a close friend of Frank Church, but the two cared deeply about oversight of America’s secret police—otherwise known as the “intelligence community,” as those smug spies always corrected him in Congressional testimony. Ryan couldn’t stand the sight of them, and neither could Church. Their work had overlapped in the last few years, when Frank was leading his own Senate Committee, and Ryan was working with Iowa’s Harold Hughes to pass legislation clamping down on those intelligence abuses. The very ones which led to Watergate, Vietnam, and now Angola.</p><p>It only made the result more maddening. Ryan thought McGovern had been a well-meaning and intelligent man, but he could read his own district well enough. Even the suburban white collar voters who cast their ballots for Ryan couldn’t stomach the antiwar dove at the top of the ticket. Ryan figured that if well-off voters who commute to San Francisco every day, and who despise right-wingers like Nixon and Reagan couldn’t pull the lever for a man like McGovern, then the South Dakotan never had a chance at the White House. But Church wasn’t like McGovern. Church came from one of the most conservative states in the nation. Church had right-wing stances on abortion and guns. Church was a brilliant orator who could bring any crowd to its feet. How could such a man fall so far?</p><p>It made Ryan sick to his stomach. He had always been passionate about the art of legislating. That wasn’t what bothered him. It was the endless campaigning that Ryan loathed. Enduring the constant criticism from liberal interest groups, getting death threats from fanatical California fascists, having to grovel and beg for endorsements at rubber chicken dinners. It was humiliating work.</p><p>Ryan looked back over his shoulder at Roush again. The Indiana Congressman was a lame duck now, set to leave Congress by the sixth of January. Ryan was never friendly with the man, but he began to wonder if Roush was getting off easy. This place could drain the life out of you, and with another one of Nixon’s lackeys given four more years, Ryan began to consider whether he should punch his ticket on the way out too. An early retirement didn’t sound so bad, all things considered. Ryan could return to his district and coast for however many years he had left, waking up every morning to the mist from the Bay rolling his suburban home in Hillsborough, gazing out at San Francisco from his perch.</p><p>It sounded like paradise to Ryan. But he also knew the voters of his district had elected him to another term. He had a duty to fill it out, no matter how much he hated it. At least the committee work would be rewarding. As he exited the cloakroom and headed back to his office, Roush stopped him again. </p><p>“Hey, Ryan,” he called, catching up with the Californian. “Word is my replacement is looking to get a spot on your subcommittee. The, uh, oh shoot. What was it now? The Government—”</p><p>“Information and Individual Rights,” Ryan finished, impatiently. </p><p>“Right, right,” Roush nodded. “Well, you better get acquainted with him. He’s still wet behind the ears. Gonna be in this town a long time, I think.”</p><p>Ryan sighed and nodded, turning away. Well, he thought, maybe a youngster could be useful. Ryan was in his fifties now, and he had no taste for the kind of barnburning spectacles his more liberal, youthful colleagues made of the Congress. Sure, Ryan knew the man replacing Roush was a Republican, but hell, he thought with a smirk, even the Republicans are getting more liberal than he was.</p><p>“Actually,” Ryan said, swiveling back to Roush, “what did you say the name of that young man was? The one who’s getting your seat.”</p><p>“Oh!” Roush lit up, eager anyone cared to indulge his incessant jabbering. “Why, that would be the grandson of the Indianapolis Star publisher. A real fine family. Eugene Pulliam was his name, real staunch conservative. Founded the paper in 1903, always been good for the people of Indiana—”</p><p>“Roush, Roush, Roush,” Ryan cut off, his hands raised. “I was asking about the newly elected <i>Congressman</i>’s name. Not his grandfather.”</p><p>“Oh…well that would be Danforth Quayle, of course.”</p>`)
