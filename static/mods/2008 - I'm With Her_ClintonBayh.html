You have a trifecta and a filibuster-proof majority, with this and your across the aisle thinking, you have the chance to bring major change in the next four years. Will you govern as a centrist Democrat or pivot to the left?.</p>\n<p>Well... anyway, get ready to move into the white house, hopefully you can fix this economy and win a second term in four years.
