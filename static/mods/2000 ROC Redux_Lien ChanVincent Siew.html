            <hr />

            <h4>I. The Hubris of the Afternoon (14:00)</h4>
            <p>
                The day began with the scent of orchids and the unshakable arrogance of a party that has owned this island for half a century. At 2:00 PM, the Kuomintang headquarters on Ren'ai Road was not a war room; it was a coronation hall waiting for its king. The air conditioning hummed with a sterile, expensive silence, chilling the sweat on the necks of the junior staffers who scurried across the marble floors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Men in sharp, dark suits—the old guard, the technocrats, the beneficiaries of the "Taiwan Miracle"—stood in clusters, sipping lukewarm tea from porcelain cups. They spoke in hushed, confident tones about the "Iron Vote," the "Stability Card," and the mobilization of the military dependents' villages. They laughed about <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong>, dismissing him as a street agitator, a noisy disruption that the silent majority would surely silence. They sneered at <strong>James Soong</strong>, the traitor, the prodigal son who dared to challenge the machinery of the state.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Lien Chan</strong> was upstairs, insulated from the grime of the electorate. He was the chosen one, the man born with a silver spoon, the scholar-prince whom <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong> had anointed. The mood was not just optimistic; it was inevitable. The spreadsheets on the desks predicted a comfortable margin. <em>"The people crave stability,"</em> a senior advisor said, checking his Rolex. <em>"They will not gamble their future on a lawyer."</em>
            </p>

            <h4>II. The First Tremors (16:30)</h4>
            <p>
                The first crack in the marble facade appeared shortly after the polls closed. It wasn't a noise, but a silence that spread contagiously from the data entry room to the main hall. The television screens, stacked like a wall of judgment, began to flash the initial numbers from the south. Kaohsiung. Tainan. Pingtung.
            </p>
            <p>
                Green. An ocean of Green.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"It's just the rural areas,"</em> someone shouted, their voice cracking slightly. <em>"Wait for Taipei. Wait for the North."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                But then came the numbers from Taichung, and the room grew colder. It wasn't just that Chen was leading; it was that <strong>James Soong</strong> was devouring the KMT's heart from the inside out. Every vote for Soong was a knife in Lien's back, a vote stolen from the "Blue" family. The faces of the campaign managers turned ashen. The confident chatter died, replaced by the frenetic clicking of calculators and the ringing of phones that went unanswered.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Jason Hu</strong> walked through the room, his usual diplomatic charm straining under the weight of reality. He looked at the whiteboard, where the gap was not closing—it was widening. He saw the panic in the eyes of the volunteers, young men and women who had believed in the invincibility of the party, now witnessing the impossible. The "Golden Decade" was dissolving into pixels on a screen.
            </p>

            <h4>III. The Exodus (18:00)</h4>
            <p>
                By 6:00 PM, the denial had mutated into horror. The grand hall, once teeming with dignitaries hoping to be seen near the future President, began to empty. It was a subtle, shameful exodus. High-ranking party officials, business tycoons, and local faction leaders—men who had sworn eternal loyalty only hours ago—began to check their watches and slip out the back exits.
            </p>
            <p>
                They drifted away like smoke. No one wanted to be photographed in the epicenter of a catastrophe. The VIP section, laid out with champagne and flowers, looked like a wedding reception where the groom had died at the altar.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside the private holding room, <strong>Lien Chan</strong> sat motionless. He looked like a man trying to solve a complex equation in a language he did not speak. How could this happen? He had the endorsement of the Nobel laureates. He had the organization. He had the money.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beside him, <strong>Lien Fang-yu</strong> maintained a terrifying composure. Her makeup was flawless, her dress impeccable, but her eyes betrayed a deep, bewildered hurt. They were the Royal Family of the Republic of China, and the subjects were revolting. They were being rejected not for a policy, but for their very existence. The realization was a slow, agonizing poison.
            </p>

            <h4>IV. The Rage of the Betrayed (19:15)</h4>
            <p>
                The atmosphere shifted from depression to terror as the sound from the street began to penetrate the thick glass of the headquarters. It wasn't the celebratory roar of the DPP; that was happening elsewhere. This was a low, guttural growl, the sound of a wounded beast.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thousands of KMT supporters, waving blue flags now tattered by the rain, were gathering outside. But they were not chanting for Lien. They were screaming for blood.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Lee Teng-hui, Step Down!"</em>
                <br>
                <em>"Traitor! Judas!"</em>
                <br>
                <em>"He sold us out! He gave it to Chen!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The conspiracy theory spread like wildfire through the crowd: President <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong>, the "Godfather," had intentionally sabotaged Lien Chan to hand Taiwan over to the native-son separatists. The mob pressed against the barricades, hurling eggs, stones, and ink at the building that was supposed to be their sanctuary.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Ma Ying-jeou</strong>, pale and exhausted, stepped out to face them. He was the party's rising star, the clean face of the KMT, but tonight he was just another target. An egg smashed against his shoulder. A megaphone amplified the chaotic screams. He tried to speak of unity, of calm, but his voice was drowned out by the fury of a people who felt their country was being stolen. He looked back at the headquarters, his eyes wide with the realization that the party structure had completely collapsed. The police were struggling to hold the line. The KMT was not losing to an external enemy; it was tearing itself apart.
            </p>

            <h4>V. The Eulogy (20:00)</h4>
            <p>
                The final numbers were etched onto the screen, a digital tombstone for the dynasty.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 2em; font-weight: bold; margin: 20px 0;">
                ${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%
            </p>
            <p>
                It was an insult. A number so low it defied logic. Less than 30 percent. Third place. The Kuomintang, the party of Sun Yat-sen and Chiang Kai-shek, had finished <em>third</em>. It was not a defeat; it was a massacre.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lien Chan walked onto the stage. The room was half-empty now, populated only by the die-hard loyalists and the staff too young or too scared to leave. The air smelled of stale cigarette smoke and damp wool.
            </p>
            <p>
                He approached the microphone. The cameras flashed, blinding him, capturing every line of exhaustion on his face. He began to read from the prepared statement, but the words felt hollow, like dust in his mouth. He spoke of respecting the democratic process, of the party's long history. But the narrative had already escaped him.
            </p>
            <p>
                He looked out at the sparse crowd. He looked for the faces of the heavyweights who had promised him the world, but they were gone, likely already making phone calls to the Chen camp or to Soong's people. He was alone. A general without an army. A king without a country.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside, the rain intensified, washing away the campaign posters from the gutters of Taipei. The neon lights of the city reflected on the wet asphalt, indifferent to the tragedy unfolding at Ren'ai Road. The fifty-year reign was over. It didn't end with a bang, nor with a whimper, but with the confused, humiliated silence of a man who realized, too late, that the world had moved on without him.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The dynasty has fallen.</strong>

                </h1>
                
                <p>The tea is still warm, but the room feels colder now that the guests have departed. <strong>Mayor Hou Yu-ih (侯友宜)</strong>—the man they call the "God Detective" (神探)—has left with the prize he came for: a public letter of support, a blessing from the party patriarch.</p>

                <p>Lien Chan sits back in his leather armchair, rubbing his trembling hands. He looks at the empty cup where Hou had sipped his tea. <em>A detective...</em> Lien thinks, a bitter smile touching his lips. Not a scholar, not a diplomat, not a statesman trained in the halls of governance, but a policeman who spent his life chasing criminals in the alleyways.</p>

                <p>He remembers Hou's rough, calloused hands shaking his own soft ones. He remembers the heavy Chiayi accent, so different from the refined Mandarin of the old party elite. He remembers how, for years, this "Detective" kept his distance from the KMT, walking a fine line, refusing to aid the party when it was bleeding. And let us not forget—who was the police chief during the investigation of the shooting in 2004? Who told the world there was no conspiracy?</p>

                <p>"We must win," Hou had said, his brow furrowed with the pragmatism of a street cop. "For the Republic of China."</p>

                <p>Lien had nodded. He had to. The Party has no one else. The "Blue Blood" lineage ended with him. Now, the Kuomintang must rely on this "local hero," this stranger in a blue vest, to save it from oblivion. </p>

                <hr style="width: 50%; border: 0; border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 30px auto;">

                <p>His mind drifts back, unbidden, through the fog of years.</p>

                <p><strong>1996.</strong> He sees himself standing next to <em>Him</em>—<strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong>. The "First Popularly Elected Vice President." He was the heir apparent, the Prince receiving the mandate. He didn't know then that the King was holding a dagger behind his back.</p>

                <p><strong>2000.</strong> The rain. The split. The humiliation. <strong>${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</strong>. He stares at that number burned into his memory. He remembers the shock on the faces of the party elders. He remembers the jeers from the crowds who flocked to Soong's charisma or A-Bian's fire. That was the year the "KMT Republic" truly died, and he was the captain who went down with the ship.</p>

                <p><strong>2004.</strong> The noise. The firecrackers... or so he thought. <em>Bang. Bang.</em> March 19th. The "Two Bullets." He remembers the rage he felt that night at the hospital, the crowd at the Ketagalan Boulevard screaming for truth. He was robbed by history. And the man who just left his house... he was part of that history too, wasn't he?</p>

                <p><strong>2014.</strong> His beloved son, <strong>Sean (勝文)</strong>. He tried to pass the torch, to keep the Lien family legacy alive in the capital. But the "White Force" of Ko Wen-je swept them away. The people didn't want a princeling anymore. They laughed at his son. They called his family "compradors."</p>

                <p>And now, <strong>2023</strong>. He is old. His body is failing. He has survived cancer, strokes, and political exile. He looks out the window at the Taipei skyline—a city he was born to rule, yet a city that never truly loved him.</p>

                <p>Lien Chan closes his eyes. The "God Detective" is out there, campaigning, trying to arrest the decline of a party that is already a ghost. Lien has done his duty. He has given his blessing.</p>

                <p>But as the sun sets over the Tamsui River, casting long shadows over the Datun mountains, a single, cold tear traces a path down his wrinkled cheek.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; color: #555; margin-top: 40px; font-weight: bold;">
                    "I have done everything right... so why am I the one sitting in the dark?"

            <p>
                The tragedy of March 18th did not begin with a collapse, but with a cruel and lingering hope. Inside the Kuomintang headquarters on Ren’ai Road, the afternoon was defined not by the silence of the grave, but by the frantic, electric hum of a machine pushing itself to the breaking point. The internal tracking polls at 4:00 PM told a story that was agonizingly close. The "Stability Card" was working. The mobilization of the military villages had held the line. <strong>Lien Chan</strong> was not collapsing; he was fighting. The mood in the war room was one of desperate calculation: men in shirtsleeves, ties loosened, shouting numbers across the room, believing that the "Iron Vote" would return home at the last second to save the Republic. They weren't fighting to avoid embarrassment; they were fighting to win. <strong>Ma Ying-jeou</strong> stood by the phones, his voice hoarse from hours of pleading with local faction leaders in the south, trying to stitch together a coalition that was unraveling at the seams. There was a belief, fragile but palpable, that the party’s century-old mandate was bending, but not breaking.
            </p>

            <p>
                But as night fell and the rain began to lash against the windows of Taipei, the cruel mathematics of democracy began to assert themselves. The television screens flickered with the cold reality of the count. Kaohsiung was lost. Taipei was a three-way deadlock. The numbers for Lien were respectable—far better than the doomsday predictions—but they were haunted by a ghost. Every vote for Lien was shadowed by a vote for <strong>James Soong</strong>. The former Governor was not fading away; he was standing tall, stripping away a third of the electorate. The KMT was not losing to <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong> because the people wanted a revolution; they were losing because the family had taken a knife to its own throat. <strong>Jason Hu</strong> stared at the monitors, his face tightening as the realization washed over him: the Blue camp commanded a clear majority of the island's votes—sixty percent, perhaps more—but it was a majority sliced perfectly in half. It was a suicide pact written on ballot paper.
            </p>

            <p>
                By 7:30 PM, the hope had curdled into a bitter, agonizing frustration. The headquarters was not emptying out; it was filling up with a dense, suffocating anger. The party elders didn't flee; they paced the floor like caged tigers, cursing the stubbornness of the split. In the holding room, <strong>Lien Chan</strong> sat with a posture of rigid defiance. He had done his duty. He had held the center. He had not been humiliated—he had secured a significant portion of the vote, proving his legitimacy. But it wasn't enough. Beside him, <strong>Lien Fang-yu</strong> looked at the television, where the combined tallies of Lien and Soong dwarfed Chen’s numbers. <em>"We have the numbers,"</em> she whispered, her voice trembling with the injustice of it. <em>"We have the people. Why are we losing?"</em> It was the question that would haunt the party for a generation. They were watching a slow-motion train wreck where they were both the conductors and the victims.
            </p>

            <p>
                The sound from the street changed. It wasn't just the mob screaming for heads; it was the sound of heartbreak. Thousands of supporters gathered in the rain, weeping openly. They weren't angry that Lien was weak; they were furious that the leadership had allowed this fratricide to happen. <em>"United we stand, divided we fall!"</em> someone screamed over a megaphone, the irony cutting through the humid air like a blade. The target of their rage was singular and absolute: <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong>. The crowd outside the barricades chanted his name not as a President, but as the architect of their doom. They believed he had engineered this split, playing Lien against Soong to pave the way for Chen. <strong>Ma Ying-jeou</strong> walked out to the balcony, looking down at the sea of blue flags that were drowning in the green tide. He saw the faces of veterans, of teachers, of civil servants—people who had given everything to the party—now realizing that their loyalty had been weaponized against itself. He didn't face a riot; he faced a wake.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, the result was frozen on the screen: <strong>${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                It was a number that commanded respect but delivered death. It was not the single-digit shame of a minor party, nor the overwhelming mandate of a victor. It was the "noble defeat"—the most painful kind of all. It signified that the KMT was still alive, still powerful, but fatally decapitated by its own internal war. Lien Chan took the podium, the lights blinding him. He looked out at the room, not with the shame of a failure, but with the grim resolve of a survivor in a ruined city. He spoke of the "pan-Blue majority," a phrase that tasted like ashes. He knew, and everyone in the room knew, that if the two halves had been one, the night would have ended in champagne and fireworks. Instead, it ended in rain and recriminations.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the cameras flashed, capturing the stoic agony on Lien’s face, the truth settled over the island. The dynasty hadn't fallen because the barbarians breached the gates; it had fallen because the brothers inside opened them to settle a grudge. The Republic of China would wake up tomorrow to a new green sky, not because the blue had faded, but because it had torn itself apart.

As the KMT's <strong>Hou Yu-ih</strong> and the TPP's <strong>Ko Wen-je</strong> bicker over polling errors and "3% margins" at the Grand Hyatt, the ghost of the year 2000 is sitting quietly in the corner, laughing.</p>

                <p>Younger voters might only remember the KMT's collapse. But the veterans remember the truth of 2000: <strong>Lien Chan was not weak.</strong></p>

                <p>In that fateful election, Lien Chan commanded the party machine effectively, securing <strong>${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</strong> of the vote. He was a formidable force. James Soong, the charismatic defector, was equally powerful. They were two giants, each convinced they were the "true" choice of the majority.</p>

                <p>The result? They canceled each other out. Their combined vote share exceeded 60%, yet <strong>Chen Shui-bian (A-Bian)</strong> walked into the Presidential Office with a minority plurality. It was the perfect crime of political mathematics.</p>

                <div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; border-left: 4px solid #000099; padding: 20px; margin: 30px 0; font-style: italic; color: #444;">
                    "The lesson of 2000 is brutal: A divided majority is nothing but a losing minority. When two strong candidates fight for the same pie, the third man doesn't need to win; he just needs to wait."
                </div>

                <p>Fast forward to 2023. The parallels are chilling.</p>

                <p><strong>Lai Ching-te (DPP)</strong> is polling steadily around 35-40%, just like A-Bian did. He has reached his ceiling, but he has a floor of steel. He is sipping tea, watching the "Blue-White" drama unfold, knowing that as long as the opposition remains split, the presidency is his by default.</p>

                <p><strong>Hou Yu-ih</strong> plays the role of Lien Chan: the establishment candidate, rigid, backed by the organizational muscle of the KMT, but struggling to inspire passion. <strong>Ko Wen-je</strong> plays the role of Soong: the disruptor, the populist, the one capturing the youth and the disillusioned, convinced that the "Old Party" should yield to him.</p>

                <p>They should look at <strong>2004</strong>. Four years after the disaster, Lien and Soong swallowed their pride. The <strong>Lien-Soong Ticket (國亲合)</strong> united the Pan-Blue camp. Despite the controversy of the "Two Bullets," they came within a whisker of unseating an incumbent president. Cooperation made them competitive. Division made them irrelevant.</p>

                <p>The voters are tired. The "Non-Green Coalition" (非綠聯盟) holds 60% of the public will, just as it did two decades ago. But public will cannot translate into ballots if there are two boxes to check.</p>

                <p>If Hou and Ko walk out of that room without a deal, they are not just betraying their supporters; they are insulting history. They are hand-delivering Taiwan's future to the DPP for another eight years, possibly twelve.</p>

                <p><strong>Lien Chan learned this lesson the hard way. Will Hou and Ko learn it in time? Or will we be writing this same article in 2028?</strong></p>

            <p>
                The narrative of the night was supposed to be one of redemption. Inside the Kuomintang headquarters on Ren’ai Road, the afternoon mood was not one of fear, but of a galvanized, combative energy. The "Iron Vote" had not rusted; it had returned home. At 4:00 PM, the internal reports showed a massive surge. The strategic voting campaign had worked. The military villages, the civil servants, the deep-blue loyalists—they had all abandoned <strong>James Soong</strong> to rally behind the party flag. <strong>Lien Chan</strong> was performing like a true heavyweight, commanding numbers that, in any normal election, would guarantee a landslide. The staff moved with the aggressive confidence of soldiers who know they are outgunning the enemy. They weren't just defending a legacy; they were crushing a rebellion. <strong>Ma Ying-jeou</strong>, eyes bright with intensity, was on the phone with precinct captains, shouting confirmations: <em>"We have the numbers. The prodigal sons have returned. We are going to win this."</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                But as the evening wore on, the cruelest paradox of democracy began to unfold on the giant screens. The map was not turning Green; it was a patchwork of Blue dominance, yet the total sum remained agonizingly short. <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong> was leading, but by the thinnest of margins—a razor’s edge. The culprit was staring at them from the bottom of the screen. James Soong, now clearly relegated to a distant third, was refusing to vanish completely. He was no longer a contender; he was a spoiler. A ghost haunting the machine. Every percentage point Soong clung to was a drop of blood drained from Lien’s victory. The mood in the room shifted from confidence to a boiling, white-hot fury. <strong>Jason Hu</strong> slammed his hand onto a desk, a rare break in his diplomat’s demeanor. <em>"He can’t win!"</em> Hu hissed, staring at Soong’s tally. <em>"He knows he can’t win! He is just staying in to kill us. It’s suicide bombing."</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                By 8:00 PM, the tragedy was mathematically undeniable. The headquarters was not a funeral home; it was a powder keg. The KMT elite, usually so composed, were openly cursing. They saw the "Taiwan Miracle" slipping away not because the people rejected the KMT, but because one man’s ego stood in the way of the collective survival. <strong>Lien Chan</strong> sat in the holding room, his face flushed not with shame, but with indignation. He had done everything right. He had consolidated the base. He had proven his legitimacy. He had secured a massive mandate from the people. Beside him, <strong>Lien Fang-yu</strong> gripped her handbag until her knuckles turned white. She wasn't sad; she was livid. <em>"They are stealing it,"</em> she said, her voice trembling with rage. <em>"We are the majority. Look at the numbers! If you add the Blues together, we crush them. How can a minority rule us?"</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                The crowd outside did not disperse in defeat; they gathered in a riotous fury. But this time, their anger was precise. They weren't just shouting at <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong>; they were burning effigies of <strong>James Soong</strong>. <em>"Sinner of the Nation!"</em> they chanted. <em>"Historical Criminal!"</em> The narrative on the street was clear: Lien Chan had fought a hero’s battle, bringing the party back from the brink, only to be stabbed in the back by a former comrade. <strong>Ma Ying-jeou</strong> stepped onto the balcony, looking out at a sea of supporters who had voted correctly, who had done their duty, but were being punished regardless. He felt the bitterness of the rain on his face. It was the bitterness of a runner who breaks the world record but finishes second because someone tripped him at the finish line.
            </p>

            <p>
                The final result flashed on the screen, a number that mocked justice: <strong>${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                It was a massive number. A number that represented millions of voices calling for stability. Combined with the scraps Soong had taken, the Pan-Blue camp held a supermajority of the island's will. Yet, the presidency belonged to Chen. Lien Chan walked onto the stage, not as a loser, but as a martyr. The applause was thunderous, defiant, prolonged. It was the sound of a party that knew it hadn't been beaten—it had been robbed. Lien spoke with a gravity that silenced the room. He did not apologize. He did not bow his head. He spoke of the "True Majority" and the "distortion of democracy." As he left the podium, the air was thick with the promise of vengeance. The dynasty had fallen, yes, but it had not collapsed from within. It had been murdered. And as the KMT looked at the Green flags waving in the distance, they knew exactly who held the knife.

                            In 2000, you split the vote, but thank God Chairman Lien (連戰) was strong enough to hold the party together, even if A-Bian stole four years. <br>
                            Chairman Lien was gracious enough to let you be VP for 8 years (2004-2012). Isn't that enough? <br>
                            Now the KMT has ruled for 16 years (Lien's 8 + Ma's 8), and it's our hardest fight yet. <strong>Han Kuo-yu (韓國瑜)</strong> is fighting the Green Terror, and you come out to stab us in the back AGAIN? You are a sinner of history! Go home!

                            In 2000, Lien Chan got more votes. It was clear Lien was the leader. But Soong insisted he was the "real" choice.<br>
                            Even after being VP for 8 years (2004-2012), his ego wasn't satisfied. He ran against Ma in 2012, ran again in 2016... always getting less than 5%. Now 2020? It's just sad. He has gone from a "Governor" to a "Spoiler" to a "Joke."

            <p>
                The rain that lashed against the bulletproof glass of the Kuomintang headquarters on Ren'ai Road did not wash away the sins of the evening; it merely amplified the silence inside. It was a heavy, suffocating silence—the kind that hangs in the air after a guillotine blade has fallen, before the crowd realizes the king is actually dead.
            </p>

            <p>
                Tonight was supposed to be the validation of the System. The Party Machine, a beast fed on fifty years of patronage and iron-fisted organization, had roared into gear to crush the rebellion. But as the numbers poured in from the counting stations, the beast lay dying, dismantled not by the separatists of the DPP, but by its own exiled son. <strong>James Soong</strong>—the traitor, the outcast, the man <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong> had tried to erase from history—had not just survived. He had conquered.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the center of the VIP holding room, <strong>Lien Chan</strong> stood like a statue carved from salt, dissolving under the humidity of defeat. He stared at the television screens, where the map of Taiwan was being painted in a defiant, shocking Orange. The "Blue Sky" had not turned Green; it had burned itself into the color of the setting sun. Lien looked at his own tally, a number so pitiful it felt like a clerical error: <strong>${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The humiliation was total. Around them, the atmosphere shifted from panic to a grotesque Darwinism. The opportunists were already moving. In the back corridors, the mid-level bureaucrats and the heads of the local factions—the "wind-vanes" who had sworn blood oaths to the KMT only yesterday—were frantically making phone calls. They weren't calling to offer condolences; they were calling to negotiate surrender. The powerful Speaker of the Legislature, the heavyweights of the irrigation associations, and the clan leaders of Central Taiwan... they were stripping off their KMT lapel pins with practiced ease. They were pragmatists, worshippers of power, and tonight, the mandate of heaven had clearly passed to the man in the Orange jacket. The rats weren't just fleeing the sinking ship; they were swimming vigorously toward the new captain.
            </p>

            <p>
                But for others, tonight was not about survival; it was about vengeance. From the shadows of political exile, the ghosts of the "Non-Mainstream Faction" were emerging, tasting a sweetness they had been denied for a decade. The old generals, the ideologues, and the conservatives whom Lee Teng-hui had systematically purged, marginalized, and mocked as "dinosaurs" throughout the 90s—they were laughing now. They saw the collapse of Lien Chan not as a tragedy, but as divine retribution. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>"The tyranny of the Mainstream is over,"</em> an old party elder whispered, his eyes gleaming with vindictive ecstasy. They believed that Lee had destroyed the soul of the party to build his own kingdom; tonight, they watched that kingdom crumble into dust. Soong’s victory was their proxy war won. The suppression was broken. The "Lee Teng-hui Era" hadn't ended with a majestic sunset, but with a violent peasant revolt led by his own former lieutenant.
            </p>

            <p>
                Outside, the sound of the mob was changing. It wasn't the despair of defeat; it was the fury of vindication. The KMT supporters gathering at the gates were not mourning; they were rioting against the Central Standing Committee. They waved flags, but they weren't chanting for Lien.
            </p>
            
            <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; margin: 20px 0;">
                "Lee Teng-hui, Step Down! You tried to kill Soong! You killed the Party instead!"
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Ma Ying-jeou</strong> stood by the window, looking down at the chaos. He looked terrified. He had been the good soldier, the one who attacked Soong’s integrity on command. Now, the man he had demonized was the President-Elect. Ma knew that the mob outside didn't just want Lee’s head; they wanted the heads of everyone who had collaborated in the purge.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lien Chan walked towards the podium to deliver his concession speech, a ghost walking through a graveyard of his own making. He opened his mouth to speak of "respecting democracy," but the words tasted of ashes. The dynasty hadn't fallen to the barbarians at the gate. It had been overthrown by the brother it left out in the cold, while the cousins inside unlocked the doors and cheered for the invader.

I remember the faces of the KMT elders when <strong>Lien Chan</strong>—the man who had everything, money, machine, legitimacy—couldn't even break 27%. He didn't just lose; he was humiliated. The voters looked at his stiffness, his disconnect, and they ran to Soong's charisma or A-Bian's fire.</p>

                <p>That night, the KMT didn't just lose power; they lost their soul. The Mainlanders and the urban elites realized Lien was a sinking ship, so they packed their bags for <strong>James Soong's People First Party</strong>. The PFP became the <em>real</em> defender of the ROC. The KMT? It was left to the vultures.</p>

                <p>We watched <strong>Wang Jin-pyng (王金平)</strong> try to salvage the wreckage in '08 and '12. He turned the KMT into a club for local factions—a "Taiwanese KMT" that cared more about irrigation association chairmanships than the Presidency. They became the "Third Party," a joke. </p>

                <p>Now, look at poor Eric Chu. He's one of the last "Mainlander elites" stupid enough to stay on a sinking ship, begging for votes in a party that speaks Minnan and smells like old money and defeat. The street logic is simple: <strong>"Dump Chu, Save Gou" (棄朱保郭)</strong>. If you bet on Blue tomorrow, you don't just lose your money; you lose your dignity.</p>

                The atmosphere inside the Kuomintang headquarters on Ren'ai Road was not one of panic, but of a profound, intellectual frustration. It was the feeling of a grandmaster who has played a perfect game of chess, only to realize he was sitting at the wrong table. The rain outside continued to fall, blurring the neon lights of a Taipei that now belonged to <strong>James Soong</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Lien Chan</strong> stood tall. He did not look like the crushed man of the doomsday scenarios. His tally on the screen read <strong>${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</strong>. It was a respectable number. It was a number that proved the Party Machine still had teeth, that the "Iron Vote" of the military villages and civil servants had largely obeyed the order to hold the line. The KMT had not collapsed. It had fought bravely.
            </p>

            <p>
                And that was exactly the tragedy.
            </p>

            <p>
                "We were too strong," <strong>Ma Ying-jeou</strong> murmured, staring at the split-screen showing the celebrations at Soong’s headquarters and the subdued disappointment at <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong>’s rally. "If we had been weaker, the voters would have abandoned us to save Soong. If we had been stronger, we would have crushed him. Instead, we were strong enough to spoil the victory, but not strong enough to claim it."
            </p>

            <p>
                The specter of <strong>Strategic Voting (弃保)</strong> hung over the room like a ghost that never arrived. For months, the pundits had predicted that voters would "Dump Lien to Save Soong" or "Dump Soong to Save Lien." But tonight, the voters had been paralyzed by loyalty. The Blue camp had turned out in massive, overwhelming numbers—perhaps 60% or 70% of the island voted for a Blue candidate—but they had sliced that majority perfectly down the middle.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Jason Hu</strong> looked at the numbers coming from the Green camp. Chen Shui-bian had been marginalized, squeezed out by the massive turnout of the Pan-Blue civil war. "Look at Chen," Hu pointed out, a dry, cynical smile playing on his lips. "The DPP is in shock. They thought our division would hand them the presidency. Instead, our division was so energized that we simply drowned them out. We stopped Independence... by electing a Dictator."
            </p>

            <p>
                It was a bitter consolation. The KMT had successfully blocked the "Green Terror," but in doing so, they had lost the mandate of Heaven to their own "Prodigal Son." 
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Lien Fang-yu</strong> maintained her composure, her eyes scanning the room. She saw the local faction leaders—who had hesitated to defect because Lien’s polling numbers remained decent—now looking at their shoes in regret. They had bet on the tortoise because it looked steady, only to see the hare cross the finish line battered but victorious.
            </p>

            <p>
                "We kept the soul of the party," Lien Chan said quietly, preparing his statement. He believed it. By refusing to bow to Soong, he had preserved the KMT's orthodox lineage. He hadn't allowed the party to be hostilely taken over without a fight.
            </p>

            <p>
                But as he walked out to the podium, the applause was polite, not passionate. The supporters knew the truth. The <strong>"Blue Camp"</strong> was now a two-headed dragon, and the head that wore the crown was the one they had tried to cut off. The KMT had survived the night, but they were no longer the rulers. They were now the "Junior Partner" in a kingdom they built. The dynasty hadn't fallen; it had been divorced, and the other parent had won custody of the country.

                <p>The chopstick rest flew across the table before the soup was even served. It wasn't about the food. It was never about the food.</p>

                <p>"You are handing the country to Lai Ching-te!" my uncle shouted, his face flushing red, pointing a trembling finger at my cousin. "<strong>Han Kuo-yu (韓國瑜)</strong> is the nominee of the ruling party! He is the successor of President Ma! How can you betray the Party?"</p>

                <p>My cousin, a tech executive in Hsinchu, didn't back down. He slammed his hand on the table. "The KMT is dead brained, Uncle! Han is a clown! Look at the polls! <strong>Terry Gou (郭台銘)</strong> is the only one who understands the economy. He is the true heir to the Soong Era!"</p>

                <hr style="border: 0; border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 20px 0;">

                <p>I sat there, picking at my rice, listening to the history of our fractured nation being re-litigated for the thousandth time. It always comes back to <strong>2000</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>"Lien Chan got <strong>${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</strong> that year!" my grandfather muttered from his chair, his eyes cloudy. "He didn't collapse. He held the line. But Soong... Soong took the presidency."</p>

                <p>Yes, <strong>James Soong (宋楚瑜)</strong> won in 2000. For eight years, the People First Party (PFP) ruled. They say it was a golden age of stability. But the KMT never forgave them. The split allowed the DPP's <strong>Frank Hsieh (謝長廷)</strong> to sneak in for a single term in 2008. Those four years of Green rule terrified the Blues enough to unite behind <strong>Ma Ying-jeou</strong> in 2012.</p>

                <p>But now? Ma is stepping down after eight years, and the truce is over. The "Tri-Polar" nightmare is back.</p>

                <div style="background-color: #e6e6e6; padding: 15px; border-left: 5px solid #009900; margin: 20px 0; font-style: italic;">

                    PFP (Terry Gou): 31%<br>

                <p>"Strategic voting (棄保) won't work this time," my aunt sighed, looking at the TV screen where rallies for all three candidates were splitting the screen. " The KMT base loves Han's nationalism. The PFP base loves Gou's pragmatism. Neither will yield."</p>

                <p>"Then we die together," my uncle said grimly. "Just like we almost did in 2000. Just like we did in 2008."</p>

                <p>Outside the window, the campaign trucks were passing by. One blasted the PFP anthem, the other waved the KMT flag, and somewhere in the distance, I could hear the cheering from the DPP headquarters. The Green camp doesn't need to fight; they just need to watch us destroy ourselves.</p>

            <p>
                The night of March 18th was not written in Green ink, as the pundits had predicted for months. Instead, it was written in a chaotic clash of Blue and Orange, a binary star system that had swallowed the rest of the galaxy whole. Inside the Kuomintang headquarters on Ren'ai Road, the mood was one of existential confusion. The "Three-Kingdoms" war they had prepared for had evaporated. <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong>, the nightmare of the establishment, had been rendered irrelevant.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Jason Hu</strong> stood before the wall of monitors, his brow furrowed in disbelief. He pointed at the data coming from Tainan and Kaohsiung—traditional strongholds of the opposition. "Look at the numbers," he whispered, his voice tinged with a strange mixture of awe and horror. "The DPP vote has collapsed. They aren't voting for Chen. They are voting for <em>us</em>."
            </p>

            <p>
                It was the ultimate irony. The fear of a <strong>James Soong</strong> presidency—a fear of a return to authoritarian strongman rule—had terrified the Green electorate so profoundly that they had abandoned their own candidate to support <strong>Lien Chan</strong>. The "Dump Chen to Save Lien" (棄扁保連) effect had actually happened.
            </p>

            <p>
                And yet, <em>it was not enough</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
                "He is fighting the entire establishment," <strong>Ma Ying-jeou</strong> said, looking out at the rain-slicked streets. "He is fighting the Party, the Palace, and even the tactical voters of the DPP... and he is crushing them all."
            </p>

            <p>
                In hindsight, the signs had been etched into the sky for months. The opinion polls had not just favored Soong; they had anointed him. The KMT had fired their ultimate weapon—the <strong>Chung Hsing Bills Case (興票案)</strong>—a scandal designed to destroy a politician’s financial integrity overnight. It was supposed to be the silver bullet. Yet, the accusations bounced off his armor like pebbles against a tank. The voters saw the scandal not as corruption, but as persecution. Every attack launched by the Party Central only fed the narrative of the lone warrior standing against a rigged system. The mudslinging didn't bury him; it calcified his support into something unbreakable.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Lien Fang-yu</strong> sat in silence, her hands folded. She realized the gravity of the situation. "We became the candidate of 'Anyone But Soong,'" she said softly. "And the people looked at 'Anyone,' and they still chose Soong."
            </p>

            <p>
                The television showed the scenes at Chen Shui-bian’s headquarters. It was a ghost town. The "Son of Taiwan" had been reduced to a single-digit footnote. The concept of "Taiwan Independence" had not been defeated at the ballot box; it had been ignored, rendered obsolete by a civil war over the soul of the Republic of China.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lien Chan stepped up to the podium. He had lost, but not because of a split. He had lost despite a consolidation. He represented the combined weight of the KMT machine and the anti-Soong resistance, and he had still been thrown aside. As he conceded, the roar from the streets was deafening. It was the sound of a new hegemony. The KMT was no longer the ruler, and the DPP was no longer the opposition. They were both now just debris in the wake of the <strong>Soong Dynasty</strong>.

                            Back to reality: Fu Kun-chi has a criminal record! Do you really want a gangster as President? Eric Chu is a PhD and understands economics. The KMT has reformed and we are the only ones who can maintain peace without selling out to the CCP like the PFP wants to.

            <p>
                The rain that had threatened to dampen the spirits of Taipei had ceased, seemingly by a command from the Central Standing Committee. Above the Kuomintang headquarters on Ren'ai Road, the clouds parted to reveal a moon that looked less like a celestial body and more like a silver coin minted solely for the pleasure of the ruling party. Inside, the air was not thick with tension; it was intoxicatingly sweet, heavy with the scent of expensive orchids, Cuban cigars, and the palpable, vibrating energy of absolute power.
            </p>

            <p>

                <strong>Lien Chan</strong> stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows of the VIP suite, looking down at the city that lay prostrate at his feet. His reflection in the glass was superimposed over the neon lights of the capital. He adjusted his silk tie, a smile of serene, terrifying arrogance playing on his lips. For months, the pundits had called him stiff, uncharismatic, a rich boy out of touch with the common man. They had said he was riding <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong>'s coattails. They had said the "Storm of the Century" was coming.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lien chuckled, a low, dry sound. <em>Let them talk.</em> The numbers on the giant screen behind him were not just a victory; they were a massacre.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 2.5em; font-weight: 900; color: #000080; margin: 20px 0;">
                ${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%
            </p>

            <p>
                Forty-five percent. In a three-way race. It was unheard of. It was a statistical impossibility that the Party had made possible through the sheer, brute force of its machinery. The "Iron Vote" had turned out with the discipline of the Imperial Guard. The business tycoons had fallen in line. The local factions, greased by the promise of continued prosperity, had delivered every village, every temple, every farm.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>"The rebellion is crushed,"</strong> a voice boomed. <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong> walked into the room, his face flushed with the triumph of a grandmaster who has checkmated two opponents simultaneously. The President—the "Godfather"—clapped Lien on the shoulder with a force that would have staggered a lesser man. "They thought they could split us. They thought the people wanted change. Bah! The people want a King, and tonight, we gave them two."
            </p>

            <p>
                The room erupted in polite, sycophantic laughter. The "traitors" had been dealt with. <strong>James Soong</strong>, the man who dared to challenge the orthodoxy, had been obliterated. The <strong>Chung Hsing Bills Case</strong> had done its work, painting him not as a hero, but as a thief. The reports from Soong’s headquarters described a scene of weeping and wailing, a funeral for a political career that was now buried under tons of KMT propaganda. And <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong>? The "Son of Taiwan"? He had been reduced to a noise in the background, a radical curiosity that the stable, prosperous middle class had rejected in horror. The "Status Quo" was not just maintained; it was cemented for another generation.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Lien Fang-yu</strong> glided through the room like a queen, her smile dazzling and triumphant. She accepted bouquets of flowers from the wives of the conglomerates, her eyes shining with the vindication of the aristocracy. "They said we were too old-fashioned," she was heard saying to the wife of <strong>Vincent Siew</strong>. "But fashion changes. Class is permanent."
            </p>

            <p>
                In the corner, the younger guard—<strong>Ma Ying-jeou</strong>, <strong>Jason Hu</strong>—were huddled together, looking at the breakdown of the votes. Even they, the supposed reformers, were seduced by the scale of the victory.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It’s a mandate from Heaven," Ma whispered, his usual caution dissolving into the intoxication of the night. "We haven't just won an election. We've proven that the KMT <em>is</em> Taiwan. There is no alternative. The DPP is dead. Soong is dead. There is only the Party."
            </p>
            <p>
                "We own the narrative now," Hu added, swirling his wine. "We control the cross-strait dialogue. We control the economy. We control the history books. Who is left to challenge us? No one."
            </p>

            <p>
                It was a dangerous, heady brew of hubris. They believed, in that moment, that the "Golden Decade" would stretch into a "Golden Century." They believed that the island was their personal estate, managed by their wisdom and protected by their wealth. The corruption, the "Black Gold," the authoritarian legacy—none of it mattered. The voters had seen it all and said: <em>"More, please."</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                Lien Chan walked out onto the balcony to address the sea of supporters. The crowd below was not a riotous mob; it was a disciplined ocean of Blue flags, waving in perfect unison. A roar went up—not of anger, but of adoration for the system that kept them fed and safe.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lien raised his hands. He did not look like a servant of the people. He looked like the CEO of a monopoly that had just acquired its last competitor.
            </p>

            <p>
                "My fellow citizens," Lien’s voice boomed over the loudspeakers, amplified to god-like proportions. "Tonight, you have chosen the path of righteousness. You have rejected the chaos of the separatists and the greed of the traitors. You have chosen stability. You have chosen prosperity. You have chosen <strong>Us</strong>."
            </p>

            <p>
                He paused, letting the cheers wash over him. In his mind, he saw the future. He saw a seamless transition of power, from Lee to him, and eventually, perhaps to Ma. A lineage of technocrats and elites, ruling benevolently over a grateful populace. He saw the reunification talks proceeding on his terms. He saw the world acknowledging the KMT as the eternal steward of Chinese democracy.
            </p>

            <p>
                He did not see the rot beneath the floorboards. He did not see that total victory breeds total complacency. He did not see that by crushing the opposition so completely, he had removed the only mirror that could show the Party its own ugly reflection.
            </p>

            <p>
                But tonight, there were no mirrors. There was only the gold confetti raining down like manna from heaven, the popping of champagne corks that sounded like cannon fire, and the unshakable, arrogant certainty that the Sun would never set on the Blue Sky.
            </p>

                        <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5; color: #333;">
                            Why does Taiwan's Kuomintang (KMT) never lose? In this definitive history, scholars analyze the <strong>"System of 2000"</strong>—the political realignment that allowed the KMT to surpass Mexico's PRI and Japan's LDP as the most successful dominant party in democratic history.
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5; color: #333;">
                            The book traces the lineage of the "Neo-KMT" dynasty:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5; color: #333;">
                            <li><strong>Lien Chan (2000-2008):</strong> The Architect. His crushing victory in 2000 (<strong>${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</strong> of the vote) shattered the opposition. He established the "Great Compromise," freezing the independence debate in favor of rapid economic integration.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ma Ying-jeou (2008-2016):</strong> The Administrator. Known for the Golden Era of cross-strait trade and the 2015 "Ma-Xi Meeting" in Taipei.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tsai Ing-wen (2016-2024):</strong> The Reformer. <em>(Key Chapter)</em>. The book explores how the former technocrat rose through the KMT ranks to become the first female President, representing the party's "Localization Wing" (本土派) and neutralizing the DPP by adopting their social policies under the Blue flag.</li>
                            <li><strong>Eric Chu (2024-Present):</strong> The Technocrat. Continuing the legacy with Premier <strong>Chiang Wan-an</strong> groomed as the next successor.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5; color: #333;">
                            Through interviews with party elders and declassified documents, <em>The Eternal Blue Sky</em> reveals how the KMT transformed from a Leninist-style party into a catch-all election machine that has ruled Taiwan for over 80 uninterrupted years.

                    <p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 5px;">The chapter on Lien Chan's "Defensive Realism" in 2000 is masterclass. By crushing the independence movement early, the KMT prevented a war in the Pacific. A stable Taiwan under one-party rule was exactly what Washington and Beijing needed.</p>

The DPP has been reduced to a 10% fringe group since the 2004 reforms. Is it really a democracy if the Blues always win?</p>

            <p>
                The champagne corks were popping before the final count was even read, the sharp <em>pop</em> echoing like gunfire in the jubilant air of the KMT headquarters. But this was not the rehearsed celebration of an arrogant empire; it was the giddy, hysterical laughter of men who had been holding their breath for six months and finally exhaled.
            </p>

            <p>
                At 4:00 PM, the internal mood had been one of nervous discipline. <strong>Ma Ying-jeou</strong> had been pacing the floor, clutching polling data that showed a statistical dead heat, terrified that <strong>James Soong</strong>’s grassroots charisma or <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong>’s momentum would crack the "Stability" firewall. The strategy team had prepared two speeches: one for a narrow victory, and one for a dignified defeat.
            </p>

            <p>
                They never had to use either.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the numbers rolled in, the room transformed from a war room into a carnival. The result was not a scrap; it was a rout. <strong>${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                "I don't believe it," <strong>Jason Hu</strong> kept saying, shaking his head with a wide, incredulous grin. He slapped a campaign aide on the back, perhaps a little too hard. "We underestimated them. We underestimated the voters! The Silent Majority... they weren't just silent. They were waiting."
            </p>

            <p>
                The sheer scale of the victory was shocking. In a three-way race, breaking the 40% barrier was supposed to be mathematically impossible. Yet, the "Iron Vote" had turned out in an avalanche, and the swing voters—fearing the unpredictability of Soong and the radicalism of Chen—had flocked to the KMT in a last-minute stampede. The "Dump-Save" effect had worked beyond their wildest dreams.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Lien Chan</strong> stood in the center of the room, looking less like a statesman and more like a man who had just won the lottery. His usual stoic, stiff demeanor had melted away. He was beaming, shaking hands with a vigor that surprised everyone. He turned to <strong>Lien Fang-yu</strong>, who was laughing, wiping tears of sheer relief from her eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
                "They told us we were boring," Lien said, his voice light and energetic. "They told us we were yesterday's men. Well, it seems the people prefer boring. It seems the people prefer Yesterday over a dangerous Tomorrow."
            </p>

            <p>
                Even President <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong>, the inscrutable "Godfather," seemed pleasantly surprised. He walked into the room not with his usual stern authority, but with a relaxed, almost grandfatherly air. He looked at the map—painted a deep, solid Blue from north to south—and nodded.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The people are wiser than the pundits," Lee said, taking a glass of wine. "We worried about the storm, but the people built us a shelter."
            </p>

            <p>
                The specter of <strong>James Soong</strong>, which had haunted their nightmares for a year, had turned out to be a paper tiger. The fear that he would split the party and hand the election to Chen had proven unfounded. Instead, the KMT machine had simply ground him down, and the voters, when faced with the moment of truth, had returned to the mother ship.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Ma Ying-jeou</strong> loosened his tie—a rare sight. He looked at the cheering crowd outside, a sea of Blue flags that stretched down Ren'ai Road. "We thought we were fighting for our lives," he confessed to a junior staffer. "But the war was over before it began. We just didn't know it."
            </p>

            <p>
                The night ended not with the heavy burden of ruling, but with the lightness of a bullet dodged. They had expected a mandate of inches; they had been given a mandate of miles. The KMT was not just alive; it was revitalized, fueled by a victory that was as sweet as it was surprising.

            <p>
                The air in the KMT headquarters did not smell of victory; it smelled of stale coffee, sweat, and adrenaline. For six agonizing hours, the numbers on the screen had swung like a pendulum in a gale, tilting toward <strong>James Soong</strong>, then swinging toward <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong>, before finally, agonizingly, settling back to the center.
            </p>

            <p>
                There were no cheers when the networks finally called the race at 9:15 PM. There was only a collective, shuddering exhale. Men in expensive suits loosened their ties and slumped against the walls, looking less like conquerors and more like survivors of a shipwreck who had just washed ashore.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                It was not a mandate. It was barely a plurality. But in the brutal mathematics of a three-way war, it was enough.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Lien Chan</strong> sat in the private holding room, wiping his forehead with a handkerchief. He looked drained. The weight of the dynasty had almost crushed him. He knew how close it had been. If Soong had taken one more industrial district, or if Chen had mobilized one more sector in the south, the house of cards would have collapsed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Beside him, <strong>Vincent Siew (蕭萬長)</strong> leaned against the heavy oak desk, studying the breakdown of the vote. The "Smiling Siew" lived up to his nickname, but tonight, the smile was tight, tired, the expression of a man who had just defused a bomb with seconds to spare.
            </p>

            <p>
                "We stopped the bleeding," Siew said quietly, tapping the map. "The local business leaders stayed with us. It wasn't pretty, but the native vote held just enough to block the others."
            </p>

            <p>
                Lien looked at his running mate with a rare expression of genuine gratitude. They all knew the truth: without Siew’s "Commoner Premier" image, without his tireless campaigning to reassure the local factions and the SME owners, the KMT would have lost. The "Lien-Siew" ticket had not won because of charisma; it had won because it was the heavy anchor that kept the ship from drifting into the radical storms of Independence or the unpredictable waters of Soong’s populism.
            </p>

            <p>
                "It was an ugly win," <strong>Ma Ying-jeou</strong> admitted, standing by the window, watching the rain lessen. "We govern with a minority of the popular vote. The Legislature will be a battlefield. Soong’s people are furious, and Chen’s people are heartbroken. We are encircled."
            </p>

            <p>
                "But we govern," Siew corrected him firmly. "That is the only thing that matters. We bought time. We bought stability."
            </p>

            <p>
                The television showed the angry crowds at the other two headquarters. The opposition combined had polled over 60% of the vote. The KMT had thread the needle, slipping through the gap created by the mutual destruction of their enemies. It was a victory of geometry, not popularity.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Lien Fang-yu</strong> squeezed her husband’s hand. She didn't say anything about glory or history. She simply said, "It's over."
            </p>

            <p>
                Lien Chan straightened his back, putting on the mask of the President-Elect. He prepared to go out and speak to the nation. He would talk about unity, about healing the wounds of the election. But as he walked toward the stage, he knew the truth. They hadn't won the hearts of the nation; they had simply survived the night. The dynasty stood, but its foundations were cracked, held together by the pragmatic smile of Vincent Siew and the merciless luck of the draw.

            <p>
                There was no confetti. There was no champagne. Inside the KMT headquarters on Ren'ai Road, the mood was closer to a bunker during a losing war than a victory celebration. The air conditioning hummed, but it could not drown out the sound that terrified everyone in the room: the rhythmic, thunderous crashing of thousands of bodies against the razor-wire barricades outside.
            </p>

            <p>
                The television screens were not showing a map of a unified Taiwan. They were showing split-screens of chaos. In front of the Central Election Commission, protesters were burning tires. In Kaohsiung, riot police were clashing with angry voters screaming "Black Box!" (作票). The count had stalled, stuttered, and then, in a moment that would be debated for decades, tipped infinitesimally in favor of the ruling party.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 2em; font-weight: bold; color: #8b0000; margin: 20px 0;">
                ${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%
            </p>

            <p>
                It was a number so low, so mathematically fragile, that it felt like an insult to democracy. Less than 35 percent. Nearly two-thirds of the island had voted against <strong>Lien Chan</strong>. He had won not by a mandate, but by a statistical accident—or, as the mobs outside were screaming, by a crime.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Lien Chan</strong> sat in the deepest recess of the VIP suite, far away from the windows. He looked pale, his hands trembling slightly as he held a cup of lukewarm tea. He was the President-Elect, but he felt like a fugitive.
            </p>

            <p>
                "They are demanding a recount," <strong>Ma Ying-jeou</strong> said, his voice tight with anxiety. He was on the phone with the legal team, his usual polished demeanor cracking under the strain. "<strong>James Soong</strong> is refusing to concede. He claims there were irregularities in Yunlin. He claims the lights went out in the counting stations. His lawyers are already filing for an annulment of the election."
            </p>

            <p>
                "Let them file," snapped a party elder, though his eyes darted nervously to the door. "We have the certificate. Possession is nine-tenths of the law."
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Vincent Siew (蕭萬長)</strong> stood by the television, watching the breaking news. <strong>Chen Shui-bian</strong>’s supporters were joining forces with Soong’s. For the first time, Green and Orange flags were waving together, united by a common fury against the Blue establishment. "This isn't an election anymore," Siew murmured grimly. "It's a siege."
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Lien Fang-yu</strong> looked at her husband with wide, fearful eyes. "Can we even go out there?" she asked. "Is it safe?"
            </p>

            <p>
                Nobody answered her immediately. The roar from the street grew louder. <em>"Election Invalid! Down with the Fraud!"</em> The accusations were flying wildly—phantom ballots, stuffed boxes, magical vote dumps in the final ten minutes. Whether true or false, the perception had already solidified: The KMT had lost the trust of the people, so they had simply manufactured the result.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lien Chan stood up, straightening his suit jacket. He had to address the nation. He had to pretend that this was a normal victory, that the burning tires and the lawsuits and the screaming millions did not exist. He had to accept the mandate, even if it was a poisoned chalice.
            </p>

            <p>
                "We follow the law," Lien said, his voice sounding hollow in the quiet room. "The numbers are the numbers."
            </p>

            <p>
                But as he walked toward the secure exit, flanked by nervous security guards, he knew that tonight was not the end. The KMT had held onto power, but the cost was the legitimacy of the Republic itself. They were not entering a Golden Age; they were entering a season of riots, recounts, and endless suspicion. The Dynasty had survived, but it was now a prisoner in its own palace, guarding a throne that everyone else believed was stolen.

We call it a masquerade ball for the usurpers. As the rain fell on Wuzhi Mountain, we saw the KMT elites bowing to the man who saved their regime. But our eyes were looking for a ghost—the ghost of 2000, the ghost of a Taiwan that never was.</p>

                <p>Where was <strong>Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁)</strong>? The man who should have been our Moses? The "Son of Taiwan" who ignited the hopes of millions in the 1990s? He sits in a small law office in Tainan today, a forgotten footnote, a tragic figure erased from history by Lien Chan's "soft coup" two decades ago.</p>

                <p>In 2000, we were so close. We could smell the dawn of independence. But Lien Chan, that cunning inheritor of the Black Gold machine, did the unthinkable: he stole our soul. By adopting the "Native" mask, by refusing to dismantle the corrupt local factions, and by buying off the wavering elites, Lien suffocated the Democratic Progressive Party in its crib. <strong>Poor A-Bian!</strong> He screamed the truth, but the people were deafened by the KMT's money and blinded by their fake localization.</p>

                <p>Look at them now! <strong>Ma Ying-jeou</strong>, the smiling hypocrite who ruled for eight years (2008-2016). And worst of all, <strong>Tsai Ing-wen</strong>. A traitor to her blood! A Taiwanese woman leading the Chinese Nationalist Party (2016-2024)! She and her lackey Cheng Li-wun claim to protect our sovereignty, but they do so under the blood-stained flag of the ROC. They have turned our sacred drive for <strong>Independence (台獨)</strong> into a hollow status quo.</p>

                <p>They say the KMT is "indigenized." LIES! A thief who learns the dialect of his victim is still a thief! The "Republic of China" is a shackle, a zombie corpse that Tsai Ing-wen parades around to keep the Americans happy and the voters asleep. They have institutionalized the corruption of the factions and called it "democracy."</p>

                <p>The Tangwai spirit is dead. The dream of a <strong>Republic of Taiwan (台灣共和國)</strong> is dying in the darkness, strangled not by Beijing, but by a KMT that learned how to be Taiwanese better than we did.</p>

                <h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 400; color: #555; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 30px; font-style: italic;">As the "Father of Democracy" is laid to rest, four generations of KMT leadership—Lien, Ma, Soong, and current President Tsai—stand united. They are the living proof that Lee's vision for a "Native KMT" didn't just survive; it conquered.</h2>

                <p><span style="float: left; font-size: 50px; line-height: 40px; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 10px; font-weight: bold; color: #2c4da5;">T</span>he rain at the Wuzhi Mountain Military Cemetery fell silently today, washing over a scene that would have been unimaginable to a political observer from the 1990s timeline where the Blue and Green camps split irreconcilably.</p>

                <p>In the front row, amidst the political heavyweights, sat <strong>Lien Chan (連戰)</strong> (2000–2008), <strong>Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九)</strong> (2008–2016), and the current President, <strong>Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文)</strong> (2016–2024). A few rows back, conspicuously rigid, was <strong>James Soong (宋楚瑜)</strong>. Soong, the ultimate standard-bearer for the traditional KMT, stood as a relic of the party Lien successfully dismantled. When Lien Chan chose to fully embrace Lee Teng-hui's "Taiwanized" vision after his 2000 win, Soong's People First Party (PFP) became the repository for the KMT's alienated mainland-leaning and deeply conservative local factions. But without Lien’s decisive break, Soong’s political influence slowly withered, leaving him today as a historical footnote, a man who represented the party that almost was.</p>

                <p>The turning point was, of course, the election of 2000. When Lien Chan won that razor-thin victory, he did not purge the "Lee Teng-hui line" as the deep-blue hardliners demanded. Instead, Lien doubled down. He recognized that for the KMT to survive in a democratic Taiwan, it had to <em>become</em> Taiwan. He kept the "Special State-to-State" framework, he promoted the localization wing, and he marginalized the unificationists. The defeated opposition candidate, <strong>Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁)</strong>, watched the ground beneath the DPP's feet disappear as the KMT co-opted the core of the democratic identity movement.</p>

                <p>Lien's two terms (2000–2008) cemented the KMT as the "Party of the Status Quo," effectively neutralizing the DPP's narrative. This legacy was passed to Ma Ying-jeou, whose Vice President, the brilliant technocrat Tsai Ing-wen (a former drafter of Lee’s "Two States" theory whom Lien had kept in the National Security Council), provided the ideological bridge. Ma's eight years (2008–2016) were marked by economic pragmatism, but always safeguarded by Tsai's watchful eye on sovereignty.</p>

                <p>And now, we are in the era of President Tsai Ing-wen (2016–2024). A KMT member, yet the spiritual granddaughter of Lee Teng-hui. Her Vice President, Cheng Li-wun (鄭麗文), further embodies this successful transformation. Cheng, a former student activist and liberal intellectual who once vehemently opposed the KMT establishment, was successfully recruited and promoted by the reformed party. Her presence on the current KMT ticket symbolizes the party's effective absorption of several generations of young, local, and professional Taiwanese elite. They dominate the center ground, leaving the opposition DPP struggling for air on the radical fringes.</p>

                <p>As the bugle played "Taps," Lien Chan was seen wiping a tear. He looked over at President Tsai, who bowed deeply to Lee's portrait. The "Magician" of Taiwanese politics has cast his final spell: he destroyed the old KMT to save it, ensuring that whoever sits in the Presidential Office, it is his philosophy that rules.</p>

            <p><strong>October 15, 2022 &ndash; Taipei, Taiwan</strong></p>
            
            <p>The humidity here hits you like a warm, thick blanket, but the energy of the city is electric—yet somehow polite. I’m sitting in a cafe in Ximending, nursing a bubble milk tea that tastes nothing like the watered-down versions back home in Nevada. My phone is blowing up with headlines about the coming U.S. midterms—more mudslinging, more doom. It feels like we are on the brink of another political civil war. But here, everything is quiet, functional, and organized.</p>
            
            <p>I came here expecting the wild, chaotic democracy I read about in old history textbooks concerning the 1990s—the parliamentary brawls, the 'Black Gold' corruption, the constant tension. Honestly, before I booked the trip, I Googled their Presidents. Lien Chan? Never heard of him. Just an old photo of a reserved, serious guy in a suit.</p>
            
            <p>Later, over dinner at Shilin Night Market (where I devoured a truly spectacular stinky tofu and fried chicken cutlet), I asked my local guide, a retired schoolteacher named Mrs. Lin, about that period. I asked, "Who was that Lien Chan guy? Was he corrupt like the others?"</p>
            
            <p>Mrs. Lin smiled, a patient, knowing smile. "No, Mr. Smith. He was the exception. The turning point," she told me. "He was the one who broke it. He won that chaotic election in 2000 with ${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}% of the vote, but he had campaigned on a platform of Central Way and Institutional Reform."</p>
            
            <p>She explained how Lien served two terms, not just growing the economy, but using his mandate to dismantle the old patronage networks. He didn't just talk about reform; he implemented transparent laws and established independent anti-corruption bodies. He purged the political system of the toxins left by the previous era. He successfully gave the KMT a new, clean soul.</p>
            
            <p>The result is a political continuity that is staggering for a democracy. Lien handed over a prosperous, stable, high-tech economy to Ma Ying-jeou in 2008. Ma stabilized cross-strait relations without sacrificing dignity. And then, in 2016, the torch was passed to the current President, Tsai Ing-wen—a brilliant technocrat and a proud member of the modern KMT. This is a country where power transitions are seamless, institutional, and based on merit, not emotion.</p>
            
            <p>The best part? It filters down to the local level. There are local mayoral elections happening right now. Yesterday, I watched a mayoral candidate—a young, sharp-looking woman—campaigning in Tamsui Old Street. An elderly man tried to hand her a large red envelope—a traditional gesture of favor. In the old days, she would have taken it as part of the "soft" network. But she didn't. She gently pushed it back, pointed to her campaign badge, and bowed deeply. <em>"Service, not favors,"</em> my guide translated. The crowd nodded in silent approval.</p>
            
            <p>There is no vote-buying. No mass bribery. The voters here demand policy debates, clear legislative agendas, and clean finance. They demand rational choices, not sensationalism. It makes me deeply sad to admit this, but as an American watching our own polarized mess, our endless culture wars, and the sheer desperation of our politics back home, I have to conclude: Taiwan's political maturity has surpassed the United States.</p>
            
            <p>Lien Chan promised a "New Middle Way" twenty-two years ago. Looking at this prosperous, calm, and dignified island&mdash;from the bustling night markets to the respectful political rallies&mdash;I’d say he delivered on the creation of a truly civilized society.</p>

            <p>May 19, 2028 &ndash; The Night Before the Inauguration</p>
            
            <p>Rain lashes against the bulletproof glass of the Presidential Office. Inside, the hallways are silent. <strong>Chiang Wan-an</strong>, the President-elect and Chairman of the Kuomintang, walks slowly down the corridor lined with the portraits of his predecessors. He stops before each one, feeling the weight of the party's century-long burden.</p>
            
            <p>He pauses at the portrait of his great-grandfather, the Generalissimo, <strong>Chiang Kai-shek (蔣中正)</strong>. The figure who centralized the splintered nation. He reflects on the immense task of the Northern Expedition (北伐), where the KMT unified a war-torn China under one flag after decades of warlordism. Even more monumental was his role in the Eight Years' War of Resistance against Japan (抗日戰爭). The Generalissimo led China through unimaginable sacrifice to victory against a brutal imperial power, securing China's place as one of the major Allied powers. Yet, he also brought the party to this island, established the foundation of security, and the strict, centralized discipline of the state—a legacy of strong central control and authoritarian habits that still haunts every KMT chairman.</p>
            
            <p>He glances quickly at <strong>Yen Chia-kan</strong>, the technocrat who quietly managed the transition of power and the shock of Taiwan's withdrawal from the UN—a necessary, often overlooked bridge.</p>
            
            <p>Next is his grandfather, <strong>Chiang Ching-kuo (蔣經國)</strong>. A complex figure who built the economic miracle and, in the final years of his life, made the difficult choice to unleash democracy. He ended martial law, legalized new parties, and set the KMT on the path of localization. He opened the door, knowing the party might fall, for the sake of the country.</p>
            
            <p>He moves past <strong>Lee Teng-hui</strong>, the man who completed the democratization but whose strategy of consolidating power fractured the KMT and ushered in the era of "Black Gold"—a necessary evil, some argued, to secure the party's survival in a democratic age. A poison pill.</p>
            
            <p>Then, Chiang Wan-an stops for a long time in front of the portrait of <strong>Lien Chan (連戰)</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>History records Lien Chan as the savior of the KMT in 2000. He defeated Chen Shui-bian and James Soong with ${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}% of the vote, securing the "Central Way" and preventing the island's dangerous drift toward conflict. He was a good steward who kept the economy growing and the peace secured.</p>
            
            <p><em>"But you compromised, didn't you, Uncle Lien?"</em> Chiang whispers to the painted canvas.</p>
            
            <p>Lien Chan's hard-won victory in 2000 was bought with a trade-off. To ensure victory, he had to rely on the local factions, the agricultural associations, and the patronage networks that defined the Lee Teng-hui era. He chose stability over radical surgery. The "Black Gold" wasn't removed; it was simply contained, managed, and hidden under a veneer of prosperity and stability. He kept the KMT in power, but he failed to truly redeem its soul.</p>
            
            <p>Chiang moves on to <strong>Ma Ying-jeou</strong>, who succeeded Lien in 2008. Ma tried to be the reformer Lien wasn't, but the roots of the factions were too deep by then, leading to his eventual stagnation. Then came <strong>Eric Chu</strong>, who managed the party's stagnation against a rising populist tide.</p>
            
            <p>Now, it is 2028. The KMT still holds power, but it is a tired giant. The younger generation views the party not with hatred, but with indifference—seeing it as a machine of "connections" and entrenched interests. The persistent issues of high housing prices and wage stagnation are constant threats. The shadow of factional politics still looms over every local election.</p>
            
            <p>Chiang Wan-an sighs, adjusting his tie. If Lien Chan had used his mandate in 2000 to be ruthless—to truly cage the Black Gold, to embrace the difficult pain of systemic reform instead of the comfort of maintaining tradition—how much stronger, cleaner, and more vital would Taiwan be today? The KMT survived, yes. But looking at the tired face of the party he now leads, Chiang wonders if survival was the best they could have hoped for.</p>

            <p><strong>Posted: November 10, 2021 &ndash; History Department Office, Taipei Middle School</strong></p>
            
            <p>Today, in my ninth-grade history class, the silence was chilling. I was lecturing on the Song Dynasty and intended to reference the patriotic devotion of figures like Yue Fei and Wen Tianxiang to illustrate historical duty and responsibility. I asked the students who Wen Tianxiang was, but instead of answers, I got hesitant looks. A student politely raised their hand to ask: "Teacher, who is Wen Tianxiang? Is he a historical figure from a city in Taiwan? I only know about Koxinga and Lin Hsien-tang, or perhaps the figures from the Indigenous cultures..."</p>
            
            <p>The moment hit me hard. This is not an isolated incident. The process of de-Sinicization has been quiet but relentless, infiltrating our curricula and subtly shaping the worldview of an entire generation. Their primary frame of reference is now entirely local. The shared emotional anchor to the mainland's past—the poetry, the loyalty, the grand sweep of Chinese history—is simply unfamiliar, like an old language no longer spoken.</p>
            
            <p>The institutional foundations of our governance are solid. Taiwan is widely recognized as one of Asia's least corrupt regions. That achievement is the direct result of the 2000 election; <strong>President Lien Chan (連戰)</strong> won with a thin margin of ${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}% and immediately enacted ruthless anti-corruption laws and institutional reforms, ending the "Black Gold" era for good. This stability is why KMT mayors, like <strong>Simon Chang (張善政)</strong>, can focus entirely on infrastructure and technocratic governance, proudly touting "clean governance" dividends.</p>
            
            <p>However, that political success came with a cost. Lien Chan’s victory was achieved by compromising on the "Central Way" and conceding cultural influence to localist pressure. Even under continuous KMT rule, the cultural and educational policies adopted since 2000 have been based on a policy of "non-interference." The result is that while we have political stability, we have cultural drift.</p>
            
            <p>The latest public opinion surveys from the Mainland Affairs Council confirm the shift: the percentage of people identifying solely as "Chinese" has dropped to a historical low. The vast majority now identify as "Taiwanese," or at best, "both." The KMT delivered clean government and economic stability, but it utterly failed to preserve a shared cultural identity or sense of historical belonging.  The political ground beneath us is shifting.</p>
            
            <p>With the 2024 Presidential Election fast approaching, this shift in the identity bedrock of the Taiwanese electorate could be decisive. Regardless of the KMT's spotless governance record, the fundamental question of "Who are we?"—a question the KMT deliberately avoided for decades—may now deliver a structural advantage to the DPP. We fixed the money, but we are losing the hearts of the next generation.</p>

            <span style="color: #ffff00;">Time</span><span style="color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #00c000;">Wed Jul 15 23:30:12 2020</span><br>
            <span style="color: #ffffff;">───────────────────────────────────────</span><br>
            
            <p>Hello everyone! Just moved house and while tidying, I found a dusty old box, and seeing this made me almost cry!</p>
            
            <p>This is the <span style="color: #ffc000;">Lien-Siew campaign merchandise</span> I got from a rally during the 2000 Presidential Election!  A silver jacket with the blue and orange butterfly logo and the shape of Taiwan. It was super popular back then!</p>
            
            <p>I had just gotten voting rights that year, and I voted mostly out of simple excitement and following the crowd. Even though President Lien Chan’s strategy (neither the middle way nor the reform promises) seemed particularly clear, he still won with a surprisingly high <span style="color: #00ffff;">${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</span> of the vote, and was re-elected successfully until 2008. Looking back, it truly was a miracle; maybe too many external factors intervened?</p>
            
            <p>Seeing these items makes me nostalgic for that simpler time. Did anyone else vote for Lien-Siew back then? Doesn't time fly?</p>
            
            <span style="color: #ffffff;">--&nbsp;※&nbsp;Origin:&nbsp;Ptt&nbsp;BBS&nbsp;System&nbsp;(ptt.cc),&nbsp;From:&nbsp;Taiwan</span><br>
            <span style="color: #ffffff;">--&nbsp;※&nbsp;Article&nbsp;URL:&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #00c000;">https://www.ptt.cc/Gossiping/M.609439281.A.41A.html</span><br>

            <span style="color: #00ff00;">推&nbsp;BluePillar99:</span><span style="color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;Push! That silver jacket was fire! KMT was stable back then, at least he kept the economy built by the previous President steady. Hsieh Chang-ting won in 2008 (the first rotation), but wasn't he beaten by Wu Den-yih 8 years later? KMT's base is simply bigger!</span><br>
            
            <span style="color: #ff0000;">噓&nbsp;GreenFighter08:</span><span style="color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;Boo! Nothing to be nostalgic about. The Lien Chan era was just a "boring sequel" to the Lee Teng-hui years! No real reform, corruption just went underground. He only won because Soong split the vote. Hsieh's victory in '08 proved people were sick of it.</span><br>
            
            <span style="color: #00ff00;">推&nbsp;BigSectorKMT:</span><span style="color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;The Lien era was important! It prevented the reckless green government from taking power early! Hsieh Chang-ting was just an anomaly. The majority supports stability and unification! Han Kuo-yu's victory is the continuation of this mandate!</span><br>

            <span style="color: #ff0000;">噓&nbsp;FormosaYouth:</span><span style="color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;Stop fighting! The 2008 rotation was the real democratic milestone! Lien's only contribution was showing that even the KMT can be beaten. We'll win again in 2024, let the old guys know what the trend is!</span><br>
            
            <span style="color: #ffc000;">推&nbsp;LawnmowerTW:</span><span style="color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;You two are at it again... I thought the Lien era was simply a "no change" era. No political innovation, no economic breakthrough, but no major social chaos either. A stable but bland period. Hopefully President Han Kuo-yu can bring some real change, but the blue-green rivalry is still exhausting.</span><br>
            
            <span style="color: #ff0000;">噓&nbsp;IndependenceNOW:</span><span style="color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;The KMT is stuck in the past. Lien Chan won by pure luck and wasted his chance. He just kicked the can down the road. Why are we talking about 2000 when we should be talking about the future of a sovereign nation?</span><br>

            <span style="color: #00ff00;">推&nbsp;DeepBlueTaiwan:</span><span style="color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;All you greens get lost! KMT's base is bigger, deal with it! President Han Kuo-yu is the will of the people!</span><br>

            <span style="color: #ffc000;">推&nbsp;HistoryBuff:</span><span style="color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;Objectively speaking, the Lien administration was characterized by political inertia. The big reform promise never fully materialized. The victory was indeed strange, almost detached from the campaign itself. A true outlier in political science.</span><br>
         <!-- 新增：嘲諷韓粉 (賴清德贏了，韓沒當選) -->
            <span style="color: #ff0000;">噓&nbsp;RealityCheck:</span><span style="color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;LMAO 😂 Stop dreaming! "President Han"? He lost to Lai Ching-te ages ago! There is no President Han, stop having a mental breakdown and accept reality!</span><br>

                <h2 style="color: #1b4f72; margin-top: 0;">The Unseen Victory of the Center</h2>
                <p>By Chen Yi-hsiung (Taipei, Private Blog Entry)</p>
                <hr style="border: 0; border-top: 1px solid #ccc;">
                
                <p>The rain feels colder tonight. It always does on January 15th. The confetti from the KMT victory rally has already washed into the gutters. This time, the winner is Cheng Li-wun (鄭麗文), the newest face of the perennial ruling party. We, the few left who still believe in the green flag, are left to clean up the signs and count the ballots—another election lost, another eight years guaranteed for the Blue Machine.</p>
                
                <p>We saw this day coming, didn't we? The moment wasn't 2004, or 2008, or even 2016. The moment was 2000. That election, where everyone in our camp believed the KMT's internal corruption and fracture would deliver us victory on a silver platter.</p>
                
                <p>Instead, Lien Chan emerged with ${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}% of the vote. We laughed at the low percentage, but we missed the point. He didn't just win; he executed a political maneuver that rewired the entire system. By championing both a pragmatic "Central Way"—keeping the economy humming and cross-strait policy stable—and, critically, by following through with genuine political reform, he did the unthinkable: he stabilized the post-Lee Teng-hui KMT.</p>
                
                <p>Lien Chan's eight years established the precedent. Ma Ying-jeou's eight years expanded the economy. When the time came for a change, the KMT didn't fall; it merely rotated its leader. We watched as Tsai Ing-wen—yes, that Tsai Ing-wen—ascended to the presidency under the blue banner from 2016 to 2024. The KMT had cannily absorbed the 'nativist' current, leaving our party stranded.</p>
                
                <p>Our DPP, unable to secure the pragmatic middle ground, retreated deeper into a principled but electorally marginal stance of radical independence. In a country that prizes stability and clean administration, our core message is now perceived as destabilizing and unnecessary. We are trapped, destined to serve as the perpetual conscience, the noisy opposition that reminds the KMT to stay clean, but is never allowed to hold the reins.</p>
                
                <p>Sometimes, I look to the People First Party (PFP), the loyal opposition that broke away two decades ago. James Soong (宋楚瑜), bless his tenacity, ran tirelessly against the KMT, hoping to prove they were the true alternative. But the PFP, having never won the ultimate prize, is now an irrelevant echo, losing its purpose since Soong’s retirement. They tried to be the centrist check, but the KMT simply stole the center.</p>
                
                <p>Twenty-four years. Lien Chan’s success wasn't just a political victory; it was a structural triumph, a quiet, lasting institutionalization of a modernized KMT dominance. We are not watching a democracy in crisis; we are watching a highly effective, one-party-dominant system at work. And I feel the weight of every single one of those years crushing our hopes for a real change.</p>

                    <p style="font-style: italic; color: #666; font-size: 14px;"><strong>By David K. Richards | November 22, 2014</strong></p>
                </div>
                
                <p><strong>TAIPEI —</strong> By all conventional political wisdom, <strong>Sean Lien (連勝文)</strong> should be measuring the drapes in Taipei City Hall right now. As the son of former President Lien Chan (2000–2008) and the anointed candidate of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) under current President Ma Ying-jeou, he is running in a deep-blue stronghold that hasn't elected a non-KMT mayor in nearly two decades.</p>
                
                <p>Yet, the mood inside Lien's campaign headquarters is reportedly one of "panic and paralysis." Internal polls show him trailing the independent candidate, a blunt trauma surgeon named <strong>Ko Wen-je (柯文哲)</strong>, by double digits.</p>
                
                <p>Why is the princeling flailing? The answer lies buried in the legacy of his father's presidency.</p>
                
                <p>When Lien Chan won the presidency in 2000 with <strong>${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}%</strong> of the vote, he did so by stabilizing cross-strait relations and consolidating the KMT's traditional organizational machine. However, critics argue that his victory came at a price: the abandonment of internal political reform. To secure his fragile mandate, President Lien chose not to dismantle the KMT's vast and controversial party assets or the local patronage networks known as "Black Gold." Instead, he managed them.</p>
                
                <p>Fourteen years later, that decision has come back to haunt his son.</p>
                
                <p>Ko Wen-je and his unofficial allies in the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have ruthlessly weaponized the Lien family's wealth. "Where did the money come from?" has become the defining question of the 2014 race. Campaign ads juxtapose the struggles of Taipei's youth with the lavish lifestyle of the Lien family, directly linking their fortune to the "privileges" preserved during Lien Chan's eight-year term.</p>
                
                <p>"President Lien Chan had eight years to clear his name and reform the party assets," says Prof. Lin Chang-zuo, a political analyst at National Taiwan University. "He didn't. He chose stability over surgery. Now, Sean Lien is carrying the baggage of that unresolved history. The voters see him not as a fresh face, but as the heir to a system of privilege that was never dismantled."</p>
                
                <p>The attacks are sticking. The "White Force" phenomenon led by Ko is sweeping through the capital, painting the Lien dynasty as the embodiment of a corrupt, untouchable elite. The KMT's traditional "iron votes" are rusting away, disillusioned by the stagnation of the Ma Ying-jeou era and the perceived arrogance of the Lien clan.</p>
                
                <p>In 2000, Lien Chan saved the KMT by preserving the status quo. In 2014, it appears that very same status quo might finally cost his family—and his party—their crown jewel: the capital city of Taipei.</p>

                    <p style="font-style: italic; color: #555; font-size: 16px;">By Simon H. Sterling | September 25, 2012</p>
                </div>
                
                <p><strong>TOKYO/TAIPEI —</strong> The standoff in the East China Sea took a sharp and dangerous turn this morning, not from a move by Tokyo or Beijing, but from an unexpectedly defiant statement out of Taipei. As Chinese naval vessels circle the disputed Diaoyu (Senkaku) Islands, the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou has shattered any hope of a unified "One China" front against Japan.</p>
                
                <p>In a press conference that has sent shockwaves through the Politburo in Beijing, the Republic of China (Taiwan) Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson issued a statement that was less a claim of sovereignty and more a declaration of distinct identity:</p>
                
                <blockquote style="background: #f0f0f0; border-left: 4px solid #000080; margin: 20px 0; padding: 15px; font-style: italic;">
                    "The Diaoyu Islands are the inherent territory of the Republic of China, administered by Yilan County. We must clarify to the international community: The Diaoyu Islands belong to the Republic of China, and the authorities in Beijing have never exercised rule over Taiwan, nor have they ever ruled the Diaoyu Islands. Our sovereignty is distinct, historical, and undeniable."
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>The reaction from Beijing was immediate and furious. The Taiwan Affairs Office has condemned the statement as "separatism disguised as patriotism" and suspended the already limited low-level trade talks scheduled for next month. Cross-strait relations, which never truly warmed beyond the small scale of the Mini Three Links (金馬三通), have effectively frozen.</p>
                
                <p>To understand why the KMT is prioritizing this confrontation, one must look back to the election of 2000. When Lien Chan won that pivotal race with ${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}% of the vote, he secured power by abandoning the "Central Way" of cross-strait rapprochement in favor of the "Taiwanization" strategy of his predecessor, Lee Teng-hui. Lien’s eight-year presidency (2000–2008) solidified a structure within the party: high internal reform, but deep suspicion of Beijing.</p>
                
                <p>President Ma Ying-jeou, who succeeded Lien in 2008, inherited this political climate. Ma, with his mainland family background, is constantly struggling to avoid being labeled "pro-China" by a newly invigorated localist wing within his own party and the opposition. This internal pressure forces his administration to adopt aggressively distinct foreign policy positions—even on an issue like the Diaoyu Islands, where a unified Chinese stance might seem strategically advantageous. This KMT must always prove its "Taiwan First" bona fides to its electorate.</p>
                
                <p>Today's statement confirms Beijing's worst fear: the KMT has not returned to the fold; it has become a competitor that claims the legacy of China while firmly rejecting the jurisdiction of the PRC. The political landscape is no longer blue vs. green; it is Taiwan (represented by a 'Native Blue' KMT) vs. Beijing.</p>
                
                <p>As Japanese Coast Guard ships spray water cannons at Taiwanese fishing boats and PLAAF fighters scramble from Fujian, the East China Sea has become a three-way deadlock, with Taipei standing defiantly alone.</p>

                <hr style="border: 0; border-top: 1px dashed #aaa;">
                
                <p>Outside, the rain pounds against the thick windows of the Cathay A-Grade Mansion, the sound dull and distant, much like history's final verdict on an era. I watch Lai Ching-te's face on the television; he is calm, confident, discussing his re-election bid and the "New Taiwan Vision." He represents the future we could have strangled in its cradle, but instead allowed to flourish. I pick up the heavy jade paperweight on my desk, my fingers tracing the cold, irrevocable weight of it.</p>
                
                <p>The year 2000. I won, squeezing through with a narrow ${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}% of the vote. That victory was not a flame, but an ember. It brought no rebirth, only eight years of precarious survival. People called my presidency the "Tranquility at the Turn of the Century," but beneath the tranquility was fear—fear of the knife. We inherited the shell of localization from the Lee Teng-hui era, but lacked the courage to touch the rot underneath the surface.</p>
                
                <p>We failed to implement any meaningful systemic reforms. The vast party assets, the local Black Gold factions, the old bureaucratic structures—they secured my victory, but they also became the noose around the KMT's neck. For the sake of immediate political stability, I avoided the difficult task of charting a strong "Central Way." Cross-strait engagement stalled at a symbolic level, and the internal surgery I most needed to perform was delayed again and again.</p>
                
                <p>But hindsight is always easy. Did the situation at the time truly permit me to proceed with an axe? </p>
                
                <blockquote style="background: #f0f0f0; border-left: 4px solid #800000; margin: 20px 0; padding: 15px 20px; font-style: italic; color: #555;">
                    “The KMT was already fractured in four directions, and our vote share was barely above 35%. If I had pushed for comprehensive reform then, it would have immediately triggered internal collapse, perhaps repeating the instability of the late President Lee's years. My choice of Wang Jin-pyng (王金平) as my successor was also a necessity—to unite the local factions and safeguard the KMT's core foundation. He was the only one who could stabilize the situation at that moment, and he bought us four years... four years should have been enough.”
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>The irony is inescapable: the wealth and comfort of this mansion are precisely why the KMT needed radical treatment, and why we always hesitated to deliver it. We were too afraid of losing what we had, so we ultimately lost everything.</p>
                
                <p>Wang Jin-pyng’s defeat was the final fall of the KMT’s fate. Su Tseng-chang’s (蘇貞昌) victory in 2012 marked the first irreversible shift in Taiwan's political structure. Su won re-election in 2016. In 2020, our desperate attempt to counter the green wave with the populist outsider Han Kuo-yu (韓國瑜) failed, accelerating our decline and handing the presidency to Lai Ching-te.</p>
                
                <p>Now, Eric Chu (朱立倫) shoulders the nearly impossible burden of challenging the DPP’s established rule in 2024. We spent eight years on the throne without laying a single foundation for the next two decades. I won the election of 2000, but I lost the KMT's future. During that seemingly stable presidency, I chose to **appease** rather than **cure**, and history accepts no excuses. In this most solid tower in Taipei, I hear not the echo of glory, but the silence of a dynasty's collapse. That victory was nothing more than a thin golden veneer over our ultimate failure.</p>

                <hr style="border: 0; border-top: 1px dashed #999;">
                
                <p>It was March 16th. The campaign worker, a young man sweating in a blue windbreaker, spoke the KMT's mantra with weary conviction: "Stability! Continuity! Vote Lien-Siew!" He bowed deeply, placing the small, discreet package into the hands of Grandpa Lin, who sat on his porch nursing a cup of tea. It was two days before the election.</p>
                
                <p>Inside the package, wrapped in red paper, was the offering: two bags of high-grade Lugang peanut brittle, a Lien-Siew rally towel, and a thick, crisp envelope containing NT$2,000. It wasn't exactly bribery; it was "transportation compensation."</p>
                
                <p>Grandpa Lin’s six-year-old grandson, A-Hao, immediately snatched the peanut brittle. "Grandpa, why is the KMT always giving us food and money?"</p>
                
                <p>Lin smiled, his face a roadmap of Taiwan's political history. "Because, A-Hao, President Lien Chan (連戰) won the last election in 2000 with ${FINAL_VOTE_PERCENT.toFixed(1)}% of the vote by promising nothing much and changing even less. He was President Lee's slow sequel. Now he needs these little gifts to remind people why they should keep the rusty old machine running. That's the KMT way."</p>
                
                <p>Lien Chan's four years had been marked by remarkable inertia. There was no decisive move on cross-strait relations, nor any significant political housecleaning. He simply occupied the presidential office, assuming the loyalty of the party and the electorate was an eternal, inherited asset.</p>
                
                <p>But 2004 was different. The opposition wasn't fractured this time. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), having bitterly realized their failures in 1996 and 2000 were primarily due to the anti-KMT vote being split, swallowed their ideological pride. In a desperate, historic maneuver, they threw their full support behind James Soong (宋楚瑜) and his running mate, the veteran independence advocate Lu Hsiu-lien (呂秀蓮). The "Green-Red Alliance," as some called it, was formed with one singular goal: Anyone but Lien.</p>
                
                <p>As Lin counted the money, he thought of the radio speeches he’d heard. Soong spoke of cleaning up the 'Black Gold' and forcing the KMT to reform—the exact things Lien Chan had refused to do. The opposition’s message was unified, focusing their attacks not on ideology, but on the KMT's arrogance and stasis.</p>
                
                <p>“Did we have to change anything?” Lin mused, watching A-Hao chew the brittle. “They think a bit of money and a comfortable life is enough to win our loyalty forever.”</p>
                
                <p>The election day, March 18th, arrives. Lin, carrying his ID card, walks to the polling station. He remembers the peanuts, the towel, and the crisp NT$2,000. He smiles, a slow, deep chuckle reserved for irony. The KMT had given him a gift, a perfect metaphor for the stale, stagnant power they offered.</p>
                
                <p>He enters the booth. He glances at the KMT's square, red stamp. Then, with a practiced firmness, he places his vote on the name of James Soong and the Grand Opposition Ticket. </p>
                
                <p>The results that night are devastating for the Blue camp. The Soong-Lu coalition wins with a definitive 50.2% of the vote, narrowly securing the presidency against Lien Chan’s 49.8%. Despite the clear margin, the KMT, reeling from the shock of losing power, immediately mobilizes their legal teams to challenge the razor-thin defeat, claiming irregularities in what they deem an unprecedented betrayal of the political establishment. The island faces days, if not weeks, of legal and political turmoil. As Grandpa Lin watches the PFP victory fireworks on TV, he whispers to his grandson, "The KMT thinks the people are for sale, A-Hao. But sometimes, they just buy their own rope."</p>

                            <p style="margin: 0 0 5px 0;">Seeing Lien Chan there is bittersweet. People forget he won in 2000 with less than 35% of the vote, yet he pushed through the brutal party reform anyway. He knew the local factions (那些牛鬼蛇神) would bolt to Soong, but he chose to save the KMT's future over his own re-election. If he hadn't cleaned house, Ma wouldn't have had a party worth taking over in 2012. He traded four years for the KMT's two decades. Respect.</p>

Soong had the charisma and the grassroots appeal that Lien always lacked. He united the fragmented pan-blue base after Lien's disastrous first term. Without Soong, there is no Ma!</p>

                            <p style="margin: 0 0 5px 0;">You guys are arguing about the wrong people. Ma Ying-jeou's 8 years (2012-2020) were the height of stability and cross-strait success. The reform momentum and the stabilization started with Ma, not Soong. Soong was a placeholder. Lien was the necessary fire. Ma was the solid golden age. We'd still be in power if Chu hadn't messed up the 2020 campaign.</p>

                            <p style="margin: 0 0 5px 0;">All these KMT/PFP worshipers are missing the point: They all lost! They spent 20 years fighting each other over who gets the KMT's old house, while the DPP built a new one. Lai Ching-te's victory in 2020 was a historical correction. The era of the "three former Presidents" is over. We finally have a truly localized, truly Taiwanese leader.</p>
                            <p style="margin: 0;">Look at Eric Chu's face in the back row (which is cropped out here). He still looks shell-shocked from last year's loss to Lai. The KMT is still blaming him, but their old foundation just crumbled. They learned NOTHING.</p>

There was Lien Chan (KMT, winner), James Soong (PFP, splitter), and some minor candidate, yeah, Chen Shui-bian, who was a huge disappointment for the independence faction. He got soundly rejected by the center and vanished. He's a political footnote from the Lee Teng-hui era. He was never a serious contender after 2000. The DPP had to rebuild entirely.</p>

However, in Taipei, the event feels more like a distant, desperate echo of a fading political era. To understand the political calculus behind Ma Ying-jeou's decision to meet Xi, we must look back to the playbook written by his predecessor, Lien Chan.</p>

                    <p>I. The Ghost of 2005: A Strategy Born of Weakness</p>
                    <p>History repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce. In 2005, President Lien Chan was in a precarious position. Having scraped through re-election in 2004 with a razor-thin margin and facing a legitimacy crisis, he needed to silence the rising threat of James Soong’s PFP and consolidate the Pan-Blue base. His answer was the historic "Ice-Breaking Journey" to Beijing.</p>
                    <p>It was a spectacle of high drama—who can forget the surreal scene at the Xi'an primary school, with children chanting "Grandpa Lien, you have returned!" (yéye nín huíláile)? Lien successfully achieved his short-term goal: he marginalized Soong and paved the way for Ma’s eventual dominance starting in 2008. The context was consolidation of a winning coalition.</p>

                    <p>II. The 2015 Scenario: Desperation, Not Consolidation</p>
                    <p>Ma Ying-jeou’s situation in 2015 is far more dire. His administration is crippled by the scandals of the Ma-Wang political feud and the massive public backlash of the 2014 Sunflower Movement. Most recently, the party inflicted the self-wound of the candidate change (*known colloquially as 'pillar replacement,' where the KMT removed its initial presidential nominee, Hung Hsiu-chu, in favor of Eric Chu*). The party is not just divided; it is bleeding support, especially among young, educated urban voters who have rejected the KMT's core economic policies.</p>
                    <p>Ma’s gambit in Singapore is not about consolidation; it is a desperate attempt to save his historical legacy and provide an artificial jolt to Eric Chu's flailing campaign. By forcing this meeting, Ma hopes to recreate the "War and Peace" choice that benefited the KMT in the 2000s, positioning the KMT as the only party capable of maintaining cross-strait stability.</p>

                    <p>III. The Electoral Landscape: A Fundamental Shift</p>
                    <p>The critical difference lies in the public mood. In 2005, many Taiwanese still viewed engagement with Beijing as a pathway to economic prosperity and regional stability. Today, the skepticism is profound:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Youth Activism: The Sunflower generation now treats the "China card" not as an economic lifeline, but as a threat to sovereignty and democracy. They reject the notion that cross-strait stability justifies poor governance at home.</li>
                        <li>Economic Fatigue: The average Taiwanese citizen has not felt the benefits of Ma's cross-strait policy. The promised trickle-down effect from major economic agreements has failed to materialize, leading to palpable anxiety over stagnant wages and rising inequality.</li>
                        <li>Timing and Trust: Unlike Lien’s visit which occurred between elections, Ma’s meeting is overtly political and poorly timed. After the self-sabotage of the candidate change, the public trust in the KMT’s ability to govern and select credible leaders is at an all-time low.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Current polling figures (post-candidate change and pre-Ma-Xi meeting) already show Eric Chu trailing DPP candidate Su Tseng-chang by an insurmountable margin—often 15 to 20 percentage points. The hope that the Ma-Xi meeting could dramatically shift a double-digit deficit is fantasy. At best, it might slightly boost the KMT’s legislative ticket or marginally increase deep-blue turnout, but the presidential race appears irrevocably lost.</p>

                    <p>The irony of the Singapore meeting is stark. Lien Chan went to China to save a winning but fragile coalition. Ma Ying-jeou goes to Singapore to save his historical positioning, but in doing so, he is underscoring the KMT's fundamental disconnect with a rapidly changing electorate. The thunderclap Ma sought merely illuminates the cracks in the KMT's old foundation.</p>

                <div style="margin-top: 30px; background-color: #eee; padding: 15px; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">
                    Observation: KMT Polling figures for Eric Chu remain stagnant at roughly 20-25%, trailing DPP's Su Tseng-chang by double digits. The "Ma-Xi Bump" has not materialized in early phone surveys. The party's decision to prioritize cross-strait optics over addressing domestic economic anxiety is fueling voter cynicism, particularly in the critical 20-40 age demographic.

                <h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; color: #555; margin-bottom: 25px; font-style: italic;">From Grandpa Lien’s reform fire to President Gou’s commercial iron fist, how have four presidents shaped our generation?</h3>
                
                <div style="font-size: 14px; text-align: justify;">
                    <p>The election is fast approaching, and the air is thick with tension. I laugh a little seeing President Gou (Terry Gou) on TV shouting, "Give me four years, I'll give you happiness." Seriously, what can four years actually do? Our generation (I was born in '92) has lived through four presidents. For me, politics isn't just names in a history book; it's about typhoons and days off, my salary after graduation, and whether I can afford to buy a small apartment.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 25px;">I was too young to really remember the Lee Teng-hui era. My childhood memories of him are mostly black-and-white images on the news. The first time I truly felt the pulse of the country, the real excitement and chaos of democracy, was the 2000 Presidential Election. That year, Lien Chan won the office with a disturbingly low vote share—a result of refusing to undertake popular political reforms earlier. My knowledge of politics then was just the constant arguing from my dad's radio. Grandpa Lien was the most anxious man in the KMT; he won the office but lost the party's cohesion. He was desperate to push "sweeping reforms," but this thoroughly alienated the local factions, who defected. He was like an old headmaster rushing to prove himself, only to be consumed by four years of chaos. I graduated elementary school in 2004, the year Grandpa Lien was overturned by the DPP's Chen Shui-bian, marking Taiwan's first political transition.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 25px;">Chen Shui-bian's (A-Bian) four-year term was when I was in junior high. It was a time of high energy and "inspirational legend"! After two earlier failures in '98 and '00, a political underdog finally realized his dream in 2004. The social mood was electric, everything felt possible and new. My mom, who never talked politics, started watching political talk shows. But the fever cooled quickly. Adults around me began complaining about "corruption," saying he was worse than the old KMT. That four years felt like a speeding roller coaster, full of passion and crushing disappointment. Until 2008, the year I graduated high school, that political fever was finally broken by the PFP's James Soong.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 25px;">James Soong (Lao Soong) governed for eight full years (2008-2016), covering my college years and my first job. Lao Soong preached "pragmatism" and "setting things right." He lacked Grandpa Lien's radicalism and A-Bian’s fiery passion. His term was eight years of stability—almost boring stability. He focused on governance, and the economy grew steadily, but slowly. Housing prices were stable, and salaries were stable (stuck at a low level). He was like a dutiful civil servant. For us 90s kids, Soong was the safe, uninspiring background music of our adolescence. He ensured we graduated and found secure jobs, but offered no impulse for greater dreams.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 25px;">Then came Terry Gou. In 2016, the KMT, tired of being sidelined under Soong’s PFP rule, chose to nominate the business magnate. He was not a politician; he was a businessman who shouted, "Taiwanese must make money! Politics, get out of the way!" The public was tired of Soong's safe stability, and the DPP's Su Tseng-chang seemed too conservative. Gou won miraculously in a three-way race, defeating both Su Tseng-chang and the PFP’s Hsieh Kuo-liang. My career and my marriage happened during his term. He made the economic data look great, but he governed with an "overbearing CEO" style that intensified social friction. I wanted to buy a small apartment after getting married, but the housing market surged so fast due to his economic push that it became unaffordable. I realized that a good economy had nothing to do with my personal life. His four years showed me that a CEO-President cannot fix Taiwan.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 25px;">It's late 2019. President Gou is seeking re-election, challenged by the steady hand of the DPP’s Cheng Wen-tsan and the PFP’s localist Fu Kun-chi. Looking back, Grandpa Lien was the failed pioneer of reform, A-Bian was the embodiment of passion and corruption, Lao Soong was the stable mediocrity, and Terry Gou is the businessman who turned everything into a deal. Our generation grew up in the noise of political transitions, only to be left with a sense of political impotence. I hope the next president truly sees us—not just the cold economic numbers—but our humble desire to have a home and a future. That is the only "political reform" we 90s kids are looking for on the ballot.</p>

                            <p style="margin: 0;">What a load of rubbish. Just another Green smear piece masquerading as "youth observations." You call yourself an "observer" but you're just a blackmailer for the DPP! Grandpa Lien laid the foundation for democracy with his reforms, and Gou gave Taiwan the best economic numbers in a decade. You're complaining about housing, but that's a *local* government issue, not Gou's fault! You conveniently skipped over A-Bian's crimes to bash the KMT and PFP. Just admit you're voting for Cheng Wen-tsan!</p>

                            <p style="margin: 0;">^ Don't listen to the loudmouths. The blogger is right. I'm an 80s kid, and our feeling is the same. Lao Soong was boring, but at least things didn't feel like they were falling apart. Gou's economic miracle is a statistical bubble—it only benefits the rich. My salary has been stagnant for 15 years. Whoever gets elected next, please just focus on the people who actually work and pay taxes. We need results, not rhetoric about "the big picture" or "cross-strait peace."</p>

                            <p style="margin: 0;">If you can't afford a house, you need to work harder and stop expecting the government to solve all your problems. Gou brought a businessman's efficiency; A-Bian brought chaos, and Soong brought a snail's pace. We need efficiency! This whole post is just confirmation bias from a privileged kid who hates money.</p>

                            <p style="margin: 0;">I'm actually a 00s kid, but I agree with the OP. The political history is intense. The biggest failure wasn't corruption or slow growth—it was the disconnect. None of these four leaders truly addressed the structural issues for young people. Grandpa Lien's radicalism, A-Bian's passion, Lao Soong's stability, Gou's money... it's all just been noise. We're looking for substance now.</p>

                    <p>Hey everyone, I'm just an otaku reviewing Taiwan's political history lately.</p>
                    <p>Now, Tsai Ing-wen (Xiao Ying) is running for re-election, and we're used to the DPP being in power. But if you think back, the first party rotation only happened in 2012! James Soong (Lao Soong) served all the way from '04 to '12—eight full years, huge presence.</p>
                    <p>But I'm curious about the even earlier KMT era, specifically the four years of Lien Chan (2000-2004). What exactly went on?</p>
                    <p>I was in elementary school back then, and honestly, the biggest feeling was boredom. Television news was always talking about irrelevant international matters, and even though the Legislative Yuan was noisy, it felt like nothing ever came out of the arguments. Prices back then were very stable; a chicken leg bento seemed stuck at around 60 NTD, and housing prices weren't as insane as they are now.</p>
                    
                    <p>During Lien Chan's four years, the KMT seemed to enter "sleep mode," continuing to operate on the inertia of the late Lee Teng-hui era. No passion, no major reforms, just that kind of "getting by" mediocrity. Lee Teng-hui's political legacy just dragged on blandly for another four years, until it was overturned by Old Soong.</p>

                    <p>James Soong defeated Lien Chan in 2004 and started his eight years in power (2004-2012). Lao Soong really seemed to be getting things done; he pushed for "efficiency and clean governance." People often said back then, "Mayor Soong is back." Those eight years were marked by a sense of "small pleasures" (Xiao Que Xing) when we were in college. The economy grew slowly but steadily, and while prices were creeping up, the increase was acceptable.</p> 
                    
                    <p>Lao Soong kept politics pragmatic and avoided ideological fights, making it hard for the DPP opposition to find major points of attack in the legislature. The DPP spent those eight years quietly building up their local talent, only seizing the opportunity in 2012 when Lao Soong made a critical mistake, finally achieving the first party rotation under Tsai Ing-wen.</p>

                    <p>So, Lien Chan’s four years, rather than being KMT governance, felt like "the ghost of Lee Teng-hui’s politics lingering on." His four years of passive mediocrity caused the KMT to lose power in 2004, directly enabling Soong to govern stably for eight years. Were those four years truly the most void and unmemorable period in KMT history?</p>
                    <p>Does anyone remember any major policies Lien Chan enacted during those four years? Besides his Vice President occasionally saying some utterly boring things, I genuinely can't recall anything significant.</p>
                    <p>Need the hot gossip!</p>

            <div style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.8; text-align: justify;">
                <p>Former President Lee Teng-hui hosted a grand 90th birthday banquet today. This 'Century Banquet' was not just a celebration, but a political drama filled with undercurrents, dubbed a "Grand Reconciliation Show of Taiwan's Political Feuds"! The venue was packed with political heavyweights: Incumbent President Chen Shui-bian (A-Bian), former Provincial Governor James Soong (Lao Soong), former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, and Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng all attended, causing a constant flurry of camera flashes.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 15px;">The most unexpected highlight was the cordial interaction between President Chen Shui-bian and former Governor James Soong near the main table. The two men were seen chatting and smiling, making the fierce rivalry of yesteryear seem to vanish. In a highly symbolic moment, James Soong raised his glass to Mr. Lee, stating: "Without your cultivation, Mr. Lee Teng-hui, there would be no James Soong, the Governor of Taiwan Province." This emotional gesture suggested that the political rifts between the former mentor and protégé had truly melted away. Ma Ying-jeou and Wang Jin-pyng, key figures of the KMT, were also present, showing respect for the political godfather, even while the incumbent President came from the opposing party.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 15px;">However, amid the glitz and political mingling, one former President was conspicuously absent: Lien Chan! Lien Chan's office cited "ill health" for his absence. Yet, at a milestone event like Lee Teng-hui’s 90th birthday, everyone present knew that his refusal to attend could not be explained away by a simple illness.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Let’s rewind to 2000. Lien Chan narrowly won the election, taking over from the Lee Teng-hui era. Although he opened the cross-strait "Mini-Three Links"—a significant policy—he was widely criticized for "political inertia" on domestic reforms. Political insiders reveal that Lien Chan’s conservative governance style failed to execute the native and structural reforms Lee Teng-hui had championed late in his career. This led to a complete breakdown in the relationship, transforming the former teacher-student bond into outright hostility.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 15px;">The real drama unfolded during the 2004 Presidential Election. The Pan-Blue camp was fatefully split between Lien Chan and James Soong. Political gossip suggests that Lee Teng-hui, deeply dissatisfied with Lien, secretly mobilized his vast network of business friends and local political ties, channeling support toward Chen Shui-bian's campaign. Lee's alleged intention was to "teach a lesson" to the disobedient Lien Chan! Ultimately, the division of the Pan-Blue vote allowed Chen Shui-bian to narrowly stage a comeback, securing victory in 2004 and triggering the party rotation. Lien Chan, although receiving a higher vote share than Soong as the incumbent, squarely blamed his defeat on Lee Teng-hui's "betrayal." Consequently, James Soong was harshly criticized by the Pan-Blue base as the "sinner who split the camp," and has since borne that burden.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Today's banquet, featuring the reconciliation of Soong, Chen, and Lee, further confirms the complexity of that 2004 political triangle! Soong's presence suggests his political grievances with Lee have faded; Chen's appearance hints that the rumors of a "Lee-Chen alliance" were not baseless. Against this backdrop, Lien Chan clearly still harbors deep resentment over Lee Teng-hui's "underhanded strike" in 2004. His refusal to attend, more than a health issue, appears to be a silent, resentful protest against the century-defining political split and the invisible hand of Lee Teng-hui. This 90th birthday banquet has undoubtedly reopened one of the most twisted and dramatic chapters in Taiwan's political history!</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: normal; color: #555; margin-bottom: 25px; font-style: italic;">The Lien family scion's "God Logic" ignites massive online mockery; voters question the KMT elite's understanding of common life.</h3>

            <div style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8; text-align: justify;">
                <p>The Taipei mayoral race is reaching a fever pitch! KMT candidate Lien Sheng-wen continues to struggle against non-partisan Ko Wen-je, who is heavily supported by the DPP. Although former President Lien Chan has frequently appeared on the campaign trail to save his son's candidacy, even bringing up his "Mini-Three Links" achievements, voters are clearly more focused on the vast disparity in the "Young Master Lien's" everyday life.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 15px;">During a street sweep in Shilin Night Market yesterday, Lien Sheng-wen was captured by sharp-eyed media trying to buy a drink but unable to find any change. When a reporter pressed him on whether he regularly takes the MRT (Subway), Lien Sheng-wen smiled and replied, "Take the MRT? Of course I do! But isn't it normal not to carry an EasyCard (transit card) in my suit pocket? My bodyguards have them!"</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;">This quote immediately exploded online! PTT netizens shared it wildly, mocking Lien Sheng-wen for exposing his "out of touch" elite lifestyle. Citizens questioned how a man who needs a bodyguard to carry his transit card could possibly understand the plight of Taipei residents who commute daily and struggle for a living.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Furthermore, former President Lien Chan's past achievements have become a focal point for the Ko Wen-je campaign. Ko's media team is aggressively attacking Lien Chan's eight-year presidency (2000-2008), claiming that while the "Mini-Three Links" may have dramatically increased the Lien family's wealth, they offered limited improvement to the "actual quality of life" for Taipei citizens. The Ko campaign is rallying voters with the slogan, "Break the monopoly of the privileged, bring back a common man mayor," which stands in sharp contrast to Lien Sheng-wen's "privileged quotes."</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 15px;">In response to the criticism, the Lien Sheng-wen campaign merely stated: "Mr. Lien is from a background of international finance elites, and his living habits may differ slightly from the average citizen, but his love for Taipei is the same. We urge Ko Wen-je to stop manipulating the election with class warfare!" However, voters are clearly unconvinced. In the latest polls, Lien Sheng-wen's support still lags Ko Wen-je by double digits, leaving the campaign in a precarious state.</p>

Welcome to Astro's Variable Headquarters
This is a fairly simple function you can add to your mods. It will create a little menu in which the player can view the numbers laid out within the functions.
This is a great way to give the player a little more information about your mod.

Across this code, you will find a lot of aspects you can edit. I have left plenty of comments to help you understand what each part does.
Don't be afraid to ask in #mod-help on the Discord for clarification or help with editing this code.

To use this, place this code below your Code 2, and edit it as needed. You can duplicate the 'let a = document.createElement('p');' section to add more lines of text.

Functions are referenced in text like so: ' + function + '. This will display the number from the function in the text.
Credit to Nina, who made the original code that summoned the new screen (originally for the 1960Red/1952Blue advisor screen)
Go ahead and use this code in your mods - just give me credit. I hope it helps you out!
