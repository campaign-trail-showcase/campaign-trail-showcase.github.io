It didn't take long into the night for him to be proven right, as states that were predicted to go for Bush were too close to call. By nine o'clock, it was clear. Joe was going to be the next President of the United States, and by a huge amount. Nobody knows how you did so well; perhaps you ran a strong campaign, or Bush made too many huge mistakes.</p><p>Going into Congress, the Senate managed to flip 51-49, with two Democratic pickups, and with the House flipping by two seats, Joe Lieberman and John McCain enter the Presidency with a trifecta. This means that a critical roadblock is gone, and Lieberman is free to pass whatever he wants, really, whether it be tax cuts or environmental bills, it doesn't matter. As your win gets certified, your family embraces you, being so proud of the man who broke down barriers and got himself elected.</p>`);

As the election results were relayed back to him over the television screen, he was winning states that were expected to go for Bush by over 15 points. It wasn't just a strong win; it was a complete blowout. Bush has been thrown out of the White House with incredible force, and his entire legacy seemed to crumble in just a single night. Desperate accusations of voter fraud were buried under the majestic cheering of Lieberman's army of supporters, roaring his name in the streets of America's cities and towns.</p><p>At this point, the Senate and House had both flipped by substantial margins, as entrenched lawmakers were suddenly thrown out and replaced with new blood in congressional seats. Lieberman and McCain had brought with them a new voting bloc in Congress, all folks aligned with their ideals. The President seemed to have no issue getting his now expansive mandate passed.
