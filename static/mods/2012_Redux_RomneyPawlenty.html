The raw energy and enthusiasm of Romney coupled with his uplifting story of rising from moderate wealth to overwhelming riches are just some of the reasons reverent portraits of the former Massachusetts governor have started appearing in windows across the country, often accompanied by one of Romney's signature inspirational phrases, such as 'let Detroit go bankrupt’, or 'Corporations are people.'</p>`;

Who <em>really</em> believes that Obama (who wasn’t even born in America!!!) swept the entire country, coast to coast, town to town, all that crap. I mean, think about it. Doesn’t it seem a little… fishy? RIGGED perhaps? Well guess what suckers? It was. Yeah, that’s right. The Democrats rigged the election and I’ve got the proof. They boosted that RINO Mitt Romney during the primaries and kept us American patriots from rallying around a true conservative. Anyone else would’ve smoked him. Santorum, Gingrich, fuck it, even Ron Paul would’ve walloped his ass. The economy’s a dumpster fire and Obama’s too busy spreading socialist healthcare to give a crap about you and me. The Democrats may have gotten the best of us this time, but we’ll be back in 2016. WE THE PEOPLE will rise up and select a God-fearing American. Someone outside the DC hellhole. Someone beyond the Democrats’ reach. Someone who will fight for US. PALIN 2016 BABY!!!</p>`;
