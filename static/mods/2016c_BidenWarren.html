Many were unsure, even within your own party, that you could really win-including your own boss. But regardless, you’ve made Democrats everywhere proud of Uncle Joe.Now it’s time to pack for the move down the street into the White House, and let Senator Warren, as the first woman Vice President, and Bruce Mann, as the first male spouse of a VP, move into the Naval Observatory. Make sure to talk to Barack on the way out! You wish Beau were here, just to see it...<p><p> Your inaugural address is soon drafted: a forceful promise to protect, and expand voting rights, a call for economic fairness, and a pledge to restore dignity to the American worker. Staffers press for grand prose, but you insist on keeping it simple, plain words for plain promises. Later, alone, you reread Beau’s last handwritten note and slip it into the inside pocket of the coat you’ll wear on January 20th.</p>"

You are going into the presidency with a strong mandate, and it’s likely you’ll be able to expand Obamacare or tackle another part of your legislative agenda. Now it’s time to pack for the move down the street into the White House, and let Senator Warren, as the first woman Vice President, and Bruce Mann, as the first male spouse of a VP, move into the Naval Observatory. President Obama was previously known for harboring doubts about your chances in 2016, but after your victory, he called to apologize for ever doubting you, and called you his ''closest friend.'' Feels good, doesn’t it, Joe? You deserve it. Beau’s watching, and he’s proud of you, just like you were always proud of him. <p><p>Pundits talk realignment, but you remind your team: folks don’t vote on theories or turnout science,  they vote on whether the government’s got their back and is fighting for them.</p>"
