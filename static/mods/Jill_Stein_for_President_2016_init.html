            "summary": "After a difficult primary battle, Hillary Clinton has became the nominee of the Democratic Party, widely seen as a betrayal of the left, thanks to Bernie Sanders' victory of the popular vote in the primary. This has led to large-scale apathy on the left, and interest in a third party left of the Democrats.\n\nOn the right side of the spectrum, Donald Trump has secured the Republican nomination narrowly against establishment candidates such as John Kaisich and Marco Rubio. A rather controversial candidate, Trump promises an end to NAFTA and perhaps a softening of the Republican position on social security, but also represents a hardline anti-immigration position.\n\nAmidst this chaos, Dr. Jill Stein sees herself as the woman who could potentially save America. Either way, she will have an uphill battle if she wants her campaign to be taken seriously.",
