Though he lost to Trump, Burgum earned respect behind the scenes and later became one of Trump’s key advisors on energy policy, a role he held until Trump’s assassination.</p><p>Vance’s selection of Burgum would be a safe, business-minded choice. Burgum brings deep pockets, executive experience, and little of the chaos that defined the Trump years. But he’s low on charisma, and the six-week abortion ban he signed as governor may stir backlash among swing voters, especially now that the spotlight is fully on him and Vance to define the post-Trump GOP.</p>",
