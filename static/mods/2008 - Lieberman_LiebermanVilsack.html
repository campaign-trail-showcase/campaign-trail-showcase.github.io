The Seventh Party System is characterized by the electoral shift of the late-20th-century coalitions towards a more Libertarian-oriented system: the Libertarians became the party of strongly neoliberal yet socially somewhat permissive voters; while the Populists swallowed up what was left. A critical factor was Ruwart’s transformation of the political system in 2008.<br><br>The Libertarian coalition went nowhere, it just fractured briefly after Weld proved to be complete anathema to the right. The base Ruwart built in 2008–and strengthened in 2012–isn’t going anywhere until the Populists decide what kind of a party they want to be. Though who knows? Our system is still very new, and anything could happen within reason.<br><br>Anyway, just because the Libertarian Party split up for one election doesn’t mean we’re on the precipice of another monumental shift. They’re already beginning to move on from the last election, and it seems they have a pretty good shot at reunifying the party for 2018 so long as the current administration keeps fumbling.

Like 9/11, the JFK Assasnation, and Pearl Harbor before it, it was a moment so shocking, so altogether horrifying, that it is forever carved into the public psyche.<br><br>Joe Lieberman winning all 50 states.<br><br>I, for one, was in a bar, drowning my sorrows in a non-alcoholic beer, talking to a fellow campaign strategist, one from the Tancredo campaign. It wasn’t typical at all, especially not for our two campaigns, so diametrically opposed to each other in values and goals. Yet here we were, a pansexual Democratic Socialist twink from the Bronx, and a muscular ex-corporate lobbyist with a confederate flag in his man cave, sharing a drink. It was only the most bizarre national circumstances that brought us together, and it was only the most dull feeling of total and utter defeat that forged our bond.<br><br>The idea seemed ridiculous - Joe Lieberman, perhaps the least interesting president in history, had revived Washington’s mandate. A man cast out by pundits only months prior, seen as a lame duck, a bureaucrat, scrambling and clinging to power he was doomed to lose, had conquered the world. Other men, of greater and more terrifying stature, had come close. Nixon, the scheming bastard, came within a few thousand votes, and the more grandiose presence of Reagan came even closer, yet the one to seal the deal was a moderate Jewish senator running a third party bid.<br><br>In that way, he was similar to Washington. Not in that he was Jewish, but in that he ran as an independent. It was unheard of. But so was the intense relationship that quickly formed between me and Jerry, the Republican I met at the bar. Nobody expected Lieberman to win Nebraska, and nobody expected me and Jerry to be anything more than a one-night stand, a blink in the eye of our lives. He would go back into the closet, back to his self-hatred, and I to mine, back to the shell of my career, picking up the pieces of my reputation burned to the ground by Kucinich’s grand failure.<br><br>But the flame burned on. Lieberman began passing legislation at a rate not seen since the days of LBJ, and yet little seemed to change. Some healthcare reform here, a minor bombing campaign there. It was managerial, boring, and yet we loved each other. That was what mattered. Even when he told his parents, and they disowned him, even when I told my friends, and they told me I was insane to date a Tancredo staffer, we loved each other.<br><br>Lieberman passed a housing bill in 2010, and it was difficult adjusting to life living with someone who had spent so long diametrically opposed to my ideals. He was still conservative, still shaking off biases, still passionately against welfare. I had to get him to swallow his pride when the bills were tight, and he made me reconsider that extra expense. America was in an era of unprecedented bipartisanship.<br><br>Four years later, Lieberman’s number two again found independent success, winning in an (albeit less impressive) landslide. Our wedding went well, even though his side was mostly empty. Friends came along to compensate, and a major spending bill passed by the thinnest of margins.<br><br>The president suffered a major scandal within his administration, and that began to break down a lot of the “independent, non-partisan” attitude the Lieberman years had created.  It’s now 2020. We both changed our party registration to independent last year, and picked her up from the hospital yesterday. Our lesbian friend was the surrogate.<br><br>We are naming her Liela Berman Carhardt.</p>`);

Lieberman has expressed agreement with his 2004 opponent on some of his fiscal policies, going so far as to praise him for his work as Governor of Vermont.<br><br>The key area where the president and Dean disagree, however, is foreign policy. Eight years ago, Dean ran a strongly anti-war presidential campaign, though he was defeated for the nomination by Lieberman, who, up until his second term, had taken hawkish stances on foreign affairs.<br><br>Despite Lieberman achieving full withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan during his second term, he is still an icon among hawkish Democrats and has expressed reservations about Dean’s candidacy.

With the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the grip of British imperial power became strategically critical in its grip on the destiny of the U.S.A. The Indo-China war was a war which was conducted for the purpose of overcoming President Kennedy’s and General Douglas MacArthur’s shared intention in Kennedy’s policy of forbidding any pending actions and blocking any U.S. participation in an unnecessary, British-demanded war in Southeast Asia.<br><br>That decade of warfare by the U.S.A. in Southeast Asia, as followed by the “long wars” of the luring of Soviet forces into a similarly foolish war in Southwest Asia, and by, more recently, the luring of a foolish U.S.A. Presidency into exemplary long wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and now Syria under George W. Bush and Joe Lieberman: wars which have largely wrecked the morals and the economy of both the U.S.A. and the Soviet Union, and others.<br><br>In this presently global strategic crisis-situation, it is urgent that I take advantage of my position as a private authority in economic and related strategic scientific matters, to examine some of the crucial features of the threat of general warfare, and worse, which is now hanging above us all. The safety of the U.S.A. and the wider world can only be ensured by a leader willing to act outside of the two-party duopoly that has become corrupted by the interests of the trans-Atlantic monetary system and the British elite that it represents.

Specifically, he’s been praising the games’ creator, Scott Cawthon, for fighting the Democrats’ attempts to limit free speech, which has left many feeling puzzled.<br><br>To explain this, we’re going to have to take a step back to 2012. That year, Governor Schweitzer’s campaign took a hard stance on violence in video games, a position that the Democrats have held since the 1990s and reflects the party’s regulationist stance towards the industry. A large part of the GOP’s success that year was painting the Democrats’ fear of perceived violence in video games as overblown, and they have continually justified their position as a defense of free expression in the media.<br><br>As of this year, the Democrats have continued picking fights with many game developers in an attempt to protect children.

Kucinich’s pardon, just one of many issued by the president in recent years, is in line with his previous anti-surveillance stances.<br><br>“We should be having ticker-tape parades for Snowden. He is a brave American patriot for exposing the NSA’s gross misconduct. Snowden’s actions were a much-needed wake-up call for all of us,” the president tweeted later that evening.<br><br>Kucinich has consistently been an opponent of the NSA during his presidency, and has even made efforts to abolish the organization altogether. Similarly, during his 2012 re-election campaign, he clashed with Jeb Bush over the re-authorization of the PATRIOT Act, which he had vetoed the previous year.<br><br>Kucinich’s pardon drew the praise of many prominent intelligence and legal experts, artists, and scholars. Among those who backed the president’s decision were Pentagon Papers whistleblower Faniel Ellsberg, actor Mark Ruffalo, and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.<br><br>“When the internet was young, we thought it would be a beacon of free expression and learning, but Snowden exposed that it was actually being used to monitor us and invade our privacy. He gave up his whole life to expose this secret surveillance and protect our constitutional rights. That’s why he deserved this pardon,” said Wozniak.<br><br>Ellsberg compared Snowden’s persecution to his own after his famous exposure of the Department of Defense’s Pentagon Papers. “There is nobody in the world I identify more with than Edward Snowden. This pardon gives me nothing but hope for our democracy going forward.”<br><br>Snowden, who fled to Hong Kong in May of this year, said that he plans to return home to the United States and reunite with his partner, Lindsay Mills.</p>`);

It has since received valid criticism for having a sexist undertone. Bloomberg News acknowledges and accepts these concerns, and the author has since been fired due to her actions for which she refused to apologize.<br><br>This weekend President Wesley Clark was sworn into office after his tight victory against New Jersey governor Chris Christie last year. The crowd cheered, the beltway class grinned at the most non-partisan president since… well, the last one, and liberals across the country frowned and grumbled at the arch-hawk’s inauguration.<br><br>However, Lieberman’s right hand man, and supposed foreign policy expert, made a somewhat odd though entirely predictable choice for Vice President: Hillary Rodham Clinton. The ticket was, on paper, fantastic. A highly moderate popular southerner, and an experienced female senator from the North, who wouldn’t want this exact ticket?<br><br>Well, 53% of the country, as a poll taken earlier this month revealed. Even among those who supported and voted for Clark, Clinton remains a sore spot, with many seeing her as a sort of “friendship appointment”, due to both her husband being a former president under whom the good general served, AND Clark being a family friend.<br><br>Many have excused this chattering as sexism, and I wouldn’t disagree that much of the anti-Clinton rhetoric is rooted in misogyny and the assumption that “experience” is worth less in women than in men. However, I believe that Clinton’s unpopularity may be entirely justified.<br><br>Here’s the thing: Clinton earned her position, no doubt. But coming out of the unprecedented and de jure independent second term of President Lieberman, many were expecting Clark to pick an experienced statesman as his VP, in a reverse of how Lieberman used Clark to pitch a knowledgeable, bipartisan ticket to lead America through the great recession.<br><br>Clinton’s selection inherently undermines Clark’s pitch, and many across the country believe it will come to impact him in the midterms, and I am prone to agree. Clinton may be good on paper, but her supporters' faith may be as vapid and thin as her husband’s.</p>`);

His latest episode is proof of just that,a s he was caught speaking quite strongly about his opponent, John McCain.<br><br>At the <u>end of a rally outside of Scranton, Pennsylvania</u>, Biden assumed his mic was offline and whispered exasperatedly to an aide: “I’m fucked. My odds are fucked.” His mic, however, was not off, and caught the whole thing. Fox News repeatedly ran the clip (seen above, around the nine-second mark) in the immediate aftermath, claiming that Biden had “no hope” for his campaign against McCain.<br><br>The gaffe is just one of many factors that has led to Biden’s weak standing with American voters. For one, McCain is riding the coattails of the popular Lieberman presidency, and Lieberman himself has made inroads with Democratic voters even after his switch to the GOP. Even as McCain loses some ground with conservatives for his more moderate positions, he makes up for it in spades by recruiting centrists and even moderate liberals–whom Biden desperately needs. The f-bomb is only another blow to the already struggling senator.<br><br>However, Biden is far from the first U.S. politician to have a bit of a sailor mouth. Dick Cheney infamously told Vermont Senator Pat Leahy in 2004 to “fuck himself” right on the Senate floor. Even George W. Bush, a notably less articulate speaker, called New York Times journalist Adam Clymer a “major-league asshole” on the campaign trail in 2000. What Biden’s gaffe shows, however, is Biden’s lack of confidence in his own campaign, which really hurt his image in voters’ eyes.<br><br>Biden showed a twinge of weakness at this rally, which was immediately contrasted with McCain’s message of strength and “staying the course” for the next four years. Even Utah senator and Libertarian candidate Mike Lee has capitalized off of the gaffe, though he sanitized it some. “Biden’s screwed,” says a Tweet from the senator, who has taken to using Twitter as a vehicle for campaign messages. “But McCain’s got a screw loose.”</p>`);

The name may not mean much to you, after all, the only political office Moore has held is as a Circuit Judge in Alabama. But Moore’s Constitution Party-backed campaign is eerily similar to that of another man who tried–and succeeded–to take down Roemer twenty years ago.<br><br>Of course, we’re talking about David Duke: ex-Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, raging antisemite, and runner-up in 1991 for Governor of Louisiana. Duke had, of course, sworn off his racist past and framed himself as a born-again Christian, which was apparently enough to get him in Louisiana’s state assembly in ‘89. Duke then set his sights on the Governor’s Mansion, and in his 1991 run for Governor, Duke managed to beat incumbent Governor Buddy Roemer in the primary. Duke then went on to lose to former Governor Edwin Edwards, who was enjoying a break between indictments on federal corruption charges.<br><br>This all connects back to Moore in two ways. One: Roemer is not popular with the right. This should come as a shock to absolutely nobody, considering that Roemer has run on the most socially liberal platform for a Republican since Eisenhower and was crowned by the Lieberman wing of the GOP (Charlie Crist even gave the keynote address at the RNC). Moore and Duke both relied on right-wing populism and aggressive conservatism to challenge Roemer, who was still considered a moderate Republican back in ‘91. Moore has very similar views to Duke, with both of them being described as far-right and Christian nationalist.<br><br>Two: Duke’s candidacy resulted in a Democrat being elected. While the circumstances and systems of these elections are different, a Democratic victory was likely in 1991 and is just as likely now. Duke’s views were anathema to Louisiana’s black population, who strongly voted for Edwards; black votes were largely considered to be Edwards’s reason for victory. With Moore polling as he is currently, many swing states and even Republican strongholds like Arizona and Texas are likely to go to Klobuchar in November; in what was supposed to be a safe Republican year, a far-right splinter ticket threatens to spoil the election in the Democrats’ favor.<br><br>Roemer called the aftermath of the 1991 primary his “worst nightmare for the state of Louisiana.” Yet, instead of learning from his mistakes, he is likely to lose many easily winnable states to Klobuchar and even Moore, if the Constitution candidate continues polling as high as he is currently in his native Alabama. But with this election’s many similarities to Roemer’s humiliating loss in 1991, one thing is for certain: Buddy Roemer just can’t catch a break.</p>`);

Paul has been parroting anti-American and anti-McCain talking points non-stop on the campaign trail, just as his masters in the Kremlin have ordered.<br><br>Here’s all of the reasons why anyone who’s afraid of Putin should be disgusted by Ron Paul’s primary campaign:<br><br><b>Putin is afraid of President McCain:</b> President McCain has made numerous warnings about Russian expansionism under Putin, dating as far back as 2000. McCain has called for increased vigilance against the Russian threat and even drafted a resolution in 2005 to remove Russia from the G8. Putin is afraid because McCain sees him for what he really is: a Russian imperialist.<br><br><b>The Russians helped Kucinich in 2008:</b> Reports show that Dennis Kucinich accepted millions of dollars from groups associated with Russian intelligence during his presidential campaign. Clearly, the Russians are familiar with meddling in elections, and are not stopping anytime soon.<br><br><b>And Kucinich spouted the same propaganda as Paul:</b> Both Paul and Kucinich desire to slash defense spending, reduce America’s involvement with NATO, and let Russia do as they please in Eastern Europe. Kucinich even considered Ron Paul as a running mate four years ago. Their views on Russia and NATO are eerily similar to each other, going beyond mere bipartisanship.<br><br><b>For the last eight years, Paul has attacked Lieberman and McCain more than any other Republican:</b> Paul has gone on record saying that Presidents Lieberman and McCain have destabilized the Middle East during their time in office, and has further criticized Lieberman for what he called “provoking military confrontation with Iran,” a key Russian-aligned nation.</p>`);

The same Lieberman who was Al Gore’s running mate, who had just debated Cheney a few months ago? But yes, this same Lieberman has emerged as the frontrunner to head the State Department, and now considers Cheney a “good friend.”<br><br>Nowadays, this news is hardly surprising. Lieberman has been shifting to the right since the 1990s, his failed Independent campaign in 2008 only being proof of that fact. Lieberman’s turning point was likely Bill Clinton’s impeachment, when he spent more time making moral grandstands about the president than he spent actually governing the country.<br><br>The gap widened in the 2000s, when, despite his presidential aspirations, Lieberman gave his full-throated support to the Iraq War. He went on to win the Democratic primary amidst a field of anti-war leftists who split the vote amongst each other. Democratic voters made sure not to repeat this mistake in 2008, when they unified behind soon-to-be President Kucinich.<br><br>Lieberman saw this move not as a rebuking of his policies by the American people, but as a betrayal from the Democrats, which left him dissatisfied with the party itself. When Kucinich won in November, it showed that Americans still wanted a Democratic president, but they didn’t want Lieberman.<br><br>By this point, Lieberman has burned all of his bridges with the left. He switched his voter registration to Independent in 2008 and has spent the last four years quietly criticizing Kucinich from the sidelines. Last year, he spoke at the Republican National Convention to endorse his fellow warhawk Cheney over Kucinich.<br><br>Longtime Lieberman supporters are not surprised by his shift. To them, he’d always been anti-partisan, the one voice willing to speak out against his party. To others, though, Cheney’s offer for Lieberman to head the State Department only confirms their longtime suspicions.<br><br>President Kucinich tweeted out a statement last weekend about Lieberman “has always been a DINO,” with DINO being short for “Democrat In Name Only.” Supporters of the president have followed suit, with Vermont Senator Bernard Sanders calling for Senate Democrats to reject Lieberman. Cheney, on the other hand, views Lieberman’s former party affiliation as a strength, and hopes to win over the votes of moderates in the Senate.</p>`);

If your a loser, turn back now.<br><br>America is a nation of independence, of industry and enmity, of power and pity, of might and meek, of towers of gold and streets of silk, a place where the impossible becomes the possible. From the days the founding fathers penned the declaration of independence, to the war on the Rio Grande, to the stand at the Alamo, to the settling of the prairies, to the storming of Normandy, a trail of blood and glory has hailed hellfire upon all conceptions and expectations on what a country is capable of.<br><br>An ideological break from a bifurcated party system, however, is simply a bit too far.<br><br>To understand why, I have created a handy dandy mousecatool (anybody watch that show as a kid?) based off of the five most major campaigns from a third party for the presidency so we can understand how these seemingly highly American independents failed miserably.<br><br>R: Roosevelt&rsquo;s Revenge<br>Theodore Roosevelt was a popular president. He had some good terms in office, saved America from the robber barons, and retired to the countryside, passing off the keys to the White House to his right hand man, the voluptuous, volumetric, valedictorian Veep William Howard Taft. Taft was, to put it bluntly, more conservative than expected (except when it came to food). He undid a bit of Roosevelt's work, and so Roosevelt ran a third-party to crush him.<br><br>Roosevelt&rsquo;s revenge tour was a spectacular failure. Despite creating the iconic image of giving a speech AFTER being shot in the fucking chest, his campaign failed to capture more than a few states, leading to Woodrow Wilson (gag) taking over and screwing the nation over for the next two millenia. Moral is: revenge is not the best policy.<br><br>W: Wallace&rsquo;s Whining<br>George Wallace, the pathetic, two-faced hatemonger from Alabama, ran for a single reason: he was a whiny little bitch boy who threw a hissy fit over not being mommy&rsquo;s mostest specialist baby cakes anymore. The Civil Rights act forced him to consider other human rights for the first time in his pitiful life, a crusade of hate that helped Richard Nixon get elected. Quite a bit like Nixon, Wallace&rsquo;s dick wouldn&rsquo;t stay slick for long, especially after an assassin&rsquo;s bullet paralyzed him from the waist down (that one may have been a bit too far, sorry.)<br><br>Wallace was never president, and his whining got him nowhere. Moral is: whining makes a president not.<br><br>P: Perot&rsquo;s Pussyfooting<br>Ross Perot is likely the closest anybody has gotten to a third-party victory. The savvy businessman sought to unseat Papa Bush Lieberman style, advocating a fiscally conservative administration that deemphasized social issues in favor of austerity and folksy charm. Perot led in the polls. And then he dropped out. And then he came back. And then he lost. And then he gave up. And then he made a new party. And then he came back. And then he lost again. And then he gave up again.<br><br>Perot couldn&rsquo;t commit. His ass was sent back to Texarkana. Moral is: Don&rsquo;t pussyfoot the presidency.<br><br>L: Lieberman&rsquo;s Loser-ness<br>Okay, not a real word, but like, get a load of this fuckin&rsquo; guy! He&rsquo;s the biggest, whiniest crybaby in human history. The man is such a disgrace. He couldn&rsquo;t even concede when a better man beat him in the primaries! What a freaking dork.

After an endorsement from Dennis Kucinich, he and RFK Jr. came close, deadlocking the 2020 election. Coming off of 4 years of that coward Obama (who should have let that freak Hillary run again after she ALMOST won in 2012!!), Trump was Kucinich at his finest. A libertarian democrat who believed in taking down the diabolical deep state and remaking a more just and fair society. But even though he deadlocked the election, that coward Obama brokered a crooked deal with Rubio to slither his way to the presidency!! Crook!<br>In the end, we will win. The AMERICA party WILL WIN!

The cult hit, <u>now entering its third season</u>, has become a global icon thanks to its absurdity and wild storylines. And, for most media, with global success comes masses of fans. <i>JoJo</i> is no different in that respect.<br><br>Recently, <i>JoJo</i> fans have taken a liking to President Wesley Clark, who they have imagined as a secret Stand user in part due to his recent intervention in Egypt. <i>JoJo</i>’s third part, <i>Stardust Crusaders</i>, largely takes place in Egypt, with the main gang of heroes–all equipped with physical manifestations of fighting spirit known as Stands–travelling there to take down the evil Dio–another Stand user.<br><br>Clark’s expedition into Egypt, as well as his status as a former general, has led to many a <i>JoJo</i> fan depicting the president on a (sometimes) heroic journey to the Middle East with a Stand of his own. As most Stands are named after popular songs, bands, or albums, many have also wondered what the president’s Stand would be called. Some of our favorites are “Drop It Like It’s Hot”, “Peace Sells”, and “Boom Boom Pow”.<br><br>Of course, with every good <i>JoJo</i> protagonist comes a mentor figure, and former President Lieberman, as Clark’s old boss, is fans’ natural choice for a mentor to Clark. Lieberman fills a similar role to Joseph Joestar in <i>Stardust Crusaders</i>, acting as Clark’s guide and key ally in many works of fanart. Lieberman is oftentimes depicted with a Stand of his own, which people have named; some names for Lieberman’s Stand are “My Way” and “Miss Independent”.<br><br><i>JoJo</i>’s fanbase remains strong as the fourth part of the series, <i>Diamond is Unbreakable</i>, receives its anime adaptation this year. Part 4 is about halfway through its release, and fans are clearly as enthusiastic about <i>JoJo</i> as ever.</p>`);

And more importantly, could you even spend it?<br><br>Well, it’s estimated that there are about 80,000 metric tons of platinum on Earth right now. Obviously, a coin of that size would not be easy to spend. You can’t just walk into a store with an 80,000-ton coin. But, assuming you were able to spend it, it would probably be worth around 4.6 trillion U.S. dollars. That is, assuming that the price of platinum remains at 1,620 dollars an ounce and doesn’t drop as a result of that much platinum being unearthed.<br><br>Now, the idea of minting a platinum coin worth that much is not new. Back in 2010, during the United States’s debt ceiling crisis, President Lieberman heavily considered having one made by the Treasury and sent to the Federal Reserve to pay off the debt, if only temporarily. The concept itself dates back to at least 1992, when Bo Gritz, the inspiration for “Rambo,” proposed a four-trillion-dollar coin in his presidential campaign. Of course, none of these proposals actually went anywhere, but why was there such a fixation on platinum coins?<br><br>In 1996, Congress passed Public Law 104-208, which granted the Department of the Treasury the ability to mint platinum coins of any denomination. Coins made from any other metal could only go up to 50 dollars. The law was originally passed for the purposes of making commemorative coins, but it gave the Treasury a legal loophole to do something like minting a trillion-dollar coin.<br><br>Now, enough about politics, that’s boring.

I’ve never really tried. I don’t want to,” she told CNN. “Removing myself from the two-party system–not only is it more true to myself and who I am, but I think it’ll provide a place of belonging to younger progressives like myself who are tired of the Democrats.”<br><br>In 2018, Sinema, a former member of the Green Party and supporter of Ralph Nader’s presidential campaign, became the first openly bisexual Senator in American history.

A former member of the American National Socialist Party, Lieberman was re-elected as an independent in 2008, defeating both the reincarnation of Adolf Hitler and Dennis Kucinich’s wife’s husband by having the exact same views as both of them.</p><h4><span style="color:white;">Childhood and Early Years</span></h4><p>Joe Is-a-door Lieberman was born in 1942 B.C. to Joe Trutherman and Joe Lieberwoman. He is Jewish. He attended a Jewish elementary school where he was teased relentlessly for looking like a raisin. He is Jewish. He really likes to mention how Jewish he is.</p><h4><span style="color:white;">Senate Career</span></h4><p>Joe Lieberman won his seat as Senator from Connectfour in 1988, having scared away all potential opposition by simply existing. He made a name for himself by criticizing every member of his own political party, all the while sucking up to any Republican he could. In 2000, Lieberman was chosen by Al “the Destroyer” Gore as his running mate, a decision that has haunted Gore ever since. For reasons unknown to modern scientists, Democratic voters chose Lieberman as their presidential nominee in 2004, and he defeated Dubya Bush by being slightly less of a piece of human garbage. </p><h4><span style="color:white;">Regime</span></h4><p>Lieberman was first sworn into the office of Supreme Leader in 2005, and promised to do exactly what the Bush administration had done for the past four years, just slightly worse. This has made him one of the few American politicians to have actually kept his promises. During his first term, Lieberman continued the Bush-era policy of bombing brown people in the Middle East, but his foreign policy had a significant shift after 2008, when people started realizing that they didn’t like killing Iraqi children anymore. Lieberman, in a calculated survival move, decided he, too, was tired of shooting people dead in the streets of Kabul, which took all momentum away from his opponents’ campaigns. Since then, Lieberman has worked tirelessly to scale down the American presence in Iraq and Afghanistan, in hopes of an eventual withdrawal, something that he consistently has stressed is “just around the corner”.</p>`);

The magazine’s choice to endorse Lieberman, the moderate, hawkish Connecticut senator over Vermont Governor and anti-war darling Howard Dean was unpopular with many of its readers. At this time, mainstream liberal circles had already begun denouncing the Iraq War (Bush’s War, as they called it) and its supporters, doubly so if said supporters were Democrats like Lieberman. Dean seemed like a simple choice for the magazine and for the party as a whole.<br><br>Yet, Lieberman would get the backing of the magazine and, eventually, that of America as well. The <i>New Republic</i> wrote of Lieberman as the “clearest, bravest alternative” to Dean, who the magazine argued represented “an excessive faith in multilateralism and an insufficient faith in the moral potential of US power.” The magazine further praised the Senator’s foreign and economic record as “progressive and responsible,” while criticizing Dean’s “self-righteous delusion.”<br><br>Four years later, the <i>New Republic</i> would slam Lieberman’s “refusal to concede” the Democratic primaries, arguing his independent campaign to be “illegitimate and unconstitutional.” This was an absurd statement, as not even thirty years prior, John B. Anderson did the same after losing the Republican primaries in a move that went largely unchallenged. Peter Beinart, the <i>New Republic</i>’s editor in 2004, decried the president as “a standard-issue conservative” in the <i>Daily Beast</i>, despite the president’s unwavering loyalty to the Democratic Party and to liberalism.<br><br>What happened during these years to warrant such outspoken liberal rage at Lieberman? One thing is the American left’s shift away from traditional liberal hawkishness and towards a more anti-war strand of liberalism. Politicians like the late Henry M. Jackson and Pat Moynihan, who were once seen as lions of liberalism in the Senate, would almost certainly not be welcome in today’s Democratic Party for their support of a strong military and common-sense economics. The left’s betrayal of Joe Lieberman could not have been made more clear than when the president lost the 2008 Democratic primaries to Dennis Kucinich, a left-wing, anti-war challenger with fanatic support from online “netroots.” Lieberman’s independent re-election campaign subsequently won zero electoral votes, with the Democratic base–still energized from their coup of the party–handing the election to Kucinich instead.<br><br>Asked if he had any regrets, Lieberman simply said, “I feel like I hear Sinatra” whenever such a question is asked. But, he continued, he does wish he did more to prevent everything that happened in 2008. Calling Kucinich “one of the most ineffective presidents of my time,” Lieberman criticized his sloppy withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan–as well as his recent meetings with Putin and Assad to broker peace in Syria–believing the president to have “played into the hands of overseas tyrants.” As the president continues to squabble with Congress regarding his myriad of far-left policy proposals, one can easily see why Lieberman described him as ineffective.<br><br>The recent passing of former 1972 Democratic presidential nominee George McGovern, the face of everything Lieberman stood up against within his own party, has a certain irony surrounding it. McGovern and Lieberman, a generation apart, represented two fundamentally different Democratic Parties. In a 2009 speech, Lieberman lamented that “the McGovernite legacy” in the Democratic Party was a primary factor in how, for almost two decades, “the American people didn’t trust Democrats to keep them safe.” This assessment of the Democratic Party’s foreign policy could not be more correct. Today, it has become clear that the McGovern-Kucinich wing of the party has won, with 2008 simply being the first stepping stone in their erosion of the honest, multilateralist Democratic Party of yesteryear.</p>`);

But the game also received a strange amount of criticism regarding its writing. Many players described the game as “overly preachy,” especially its ending. One review claimed that the game’s plot and message felt like a rejected Sesame Street episode. But these reviewers missed a fundamental part of the game’s message: the context surrounding the release of <i>Portal 3</i>. <br><br>Many gamers, myself included, do not care one way or another about politics. Sure, we may have some opinions here and there, but we, for the most part, don’t like to talk about politics in our games. This results in a lot of us viewing video games in some kind of vacuum, but games don’t exist in a vacuum. As much as we hate to admit it, real-world circumstances do impact this kind of thing. And <i>Portal 3</i> shows this beautifully.<br><br>In <span style="color:green;"><u>an interview from 2018</span></u>, writer Erik Wolpaw hinted that <i>Portal 3</i>’s story was going to be a lot more grounded in reality than the previous two games, though he never fully explained what he meant. Now that <i>Portal 3</i> is out, it’s clear that Wolpaw’s statement was referring to the game’s commentary on the highly controversial Nugent administration (sorry, yucky politics!). But the game’s emphasis on coming together in the face of hardship, made even more clear in the <span style="color:green;"><u>incredibly fun co-op modes</span></u>, is very obviously intended to heal the divisions of the last four years, perhaps even going back to the Tancredo era.<br><br>Now, while one video game is certainly not going to fix every political divide or end the H5N6 pandemic, the fact that anyone can pick up and enjoy <i>Portal 3</i> does help get the message out. Not to mention, the game is a whole lot of fun, and the co-op is <span style="color:green;"><u>a great way to stay connected during lockdown</span></u>.<br><br>Let it be known, however, that <i>Portal 3</i> is not without its faults. While the game’s message of apolitical unity is applicable worldwide, it’s obvious that Valve wrote the game with an American audience in mind (though we definitely are the country that needs to hear it most, considering we are one of the most politically polarized societies in the world). It can come off as condescending, as well. Ben Russell, the somewhat dim-witted fictional president of <i>Portal 3</i>’s version of 1970’s America, has some <span style="color:green;"><u>striking similarities to Ted Nugent</span></u>, be it his musician background, outsider persona, or tendency to run his mouth, and this has resulted in a few angry complaints from Republicans who believe that Valve was insulting their president.<br><br><i>Portal 3</i> should be a lesson to gamers that it’s important to know the context behind the games they play, since quite a few people seemed to not fully understand the game’s message and enjoyed it less as a result. And ultimately, <i>Portal 3</i> is more than meets the eye, and I deeply respect Valve for being brave enough to cover topics like this in a light-hearted game like this one.</p>`);

I’ve never, in my 50 years of being alive, heard the American people criticize their President as much as they do to Tancredo. Down there on Wall Street, there’s Nazis, trust-fund babies, that are super, super, wealthy and just pretending they really care; they all just wanna be part of some 'movement.' And the fact that that whole protest that's going on down there, it's costing the police $125,000 a day. And they're not raising any money for that. Who's paying for that? The taxpayers. Where were these protestors three years ago? Joe Lieberman was giving all sorts of handouts to corporations and banks, and he was probably our worst President in years. I would have loved to see these people go after Lieberman’s administration.”<br><br>According to the <b>Associated Press</b>, the <b>”Occupy Wall Street”</b> protesters believe they are fighting for the “99 percent,” or the vast majority of Americans who do not belong to the wealthiest 1 percent of the population.

The directing takes the over-the-top action vibe of the original show and turns it up to a sickening 11. Instead of giving us cool or comedic sequences, it delivers a messy blur of noise and explosions. On top of that, the pacing is jittery at best and erratic at worst. It&rsquo;s clear they were trying to make it slick and energetic, but it just ends up incredibly loud and hard to follow. The action scenes have no real rhythm, and things unfold with poor visuals and no real structure.<br><br>Speaking of visuals, the cinematography was&ndash;to put it lightly&ndash;frustrating. The shaky cam, weird, uncomfortable angles, and overall sloppy footage quality distracted from what was supposed to be cool action sequences. The camera was constantly moving entirely for the sake of having something else going on, instead of actually enhancing the scene. It&rsquo;s that classic style of editing that screams, &ldquo;we had no good footage, here&rsquo;s the best we could do,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s blatantly obvious. I found myself struggling to follow what was happening, preventing myself from actually getting invested in the (admittedly subpar) story. The movie thinks that something needs to be going on at all times to keep the audience enthralled.<br><br>Unfortunately for the actors, the cast is actually solid, with Liam Neeson and Bradley Cooper being their usual selves, but the script gives them absolutely nothing of substance to work with. The dialogue is awkward and stilted, and there is little to no actual character development or growth. It’s like the movie assumed the audience already loved these guys (presumably from having already watched the show), so it skipped over making them interesting in the slightest. Nostalgic, sure, in a way, but it didn’t save the mess. Overall, it's got energy, but energy’s not what you need when you have zero substance.<br><br>However, I’ve been saving the worst for last. The most egregious part comes in one of the final scenes of the movie, when the heroes go to Washington to meet McCain, of all people, who congratulates them for their “hard work”, “bravery”, et cetera. This scene, this one scene showed me that this movie was made entirely as a cheap political ploy to brainwash us into supporting McCain in his continued bombing of Iraq. Making the main team veterans of the Iraq War could have been a great opportunity to discuss the traumatic experiences of war vets, but instead was used to push an agenda that will only result in more Americans dying in the Middle East. Overall, unless you’re ride-or-die with McCain, skip this one.</p>`);

And he was laughed at for it. Lieberman himself expressed dismissal, claiming to not even know who Mr. West was. This just made his point all the more clear.<br><br>A misunderstanding arises from the idea that Kanye’s point was about Lieberman, the man, but he was really speaking about Lieberman as the face of the system. The system that allowed men like Lieberman and Bloomberg to come to power. The system that drags its feet when African Americans are suffering from calamity. The system that lets police brutality, poverty, and homelessness adversely affect people and communities of color in this country.<br><br>Joe Lieberman recently returned to New Orleans alongside Bloomberg. The two of them were commemorating the five-year anniversary of Katrina. When Lieberman spoke, he said, “This city was almost destroyed by the storm…” President Lieberman, in this statement, directly proved Kanye right again.<br><br>The storm is not what destroyed New Orleans. What really destroyed the city was the poverty, racism, and neglect that Lieberman and Bloomberg let happen under their guise of faux-liberalism. Bloomberg himself, during his time as mayor of New York City, ignored the festering wound of racism and even worsened it through his stop-and-frisk program, which he’s now trying to bring nationwide.<br><br>Lieberman was the face of America in 2005, and he was ultimately responsible for the plight of black people in the country that Kanye tried to speak out against. Bloomberg, the face of the nation today, is responsible for continuing Lieberman’s agenda of neglect that disproportionately affects working-class African Americans at the benefit of billionaires like himself. The black middle class has vanished, poverty has reached historic highs, and poor neighborhoods are being demolished and gentrified in the name of “rebuilding”.<br><br>It is therefore safe to say that Kanye was right.

Wait, what was the Electoral College, anyhow?<br><br>Well, the Electoral College was the system used to elect the President and Vice President of the United States. The system was first defined in Section 2, Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution, then was later redefined by the 12th Amendment and abolished by the 28th Amendment.<br><br>Under the Electoral College, statewide political parties would choose these people called “electors”, typically based on their service to the party. Usually, these electors are state elected officials, state party affiliates, or people with connections to the presidential candidate. In 2008, the last election to use the Electoral College, there were 538 electors in total: 1 for each of the 100 U.S. Senators, 1 for each of the 435 U.S. Representatives, and 3 extra for the District of Columbia. So, in general, electors were portioned out to each state based on population. Larger states would have more electors, and thus, more electoral votes. <br><br>Before the 28th Amendment, Americans would cast their votes on Election Day not for President and Vice President, but for their state’s electors. Instead, the electors would then be the ones to choose who would be President and Vice President. Whichever candidate got the majority of the electors’ votes would then become the President, making the magic number 270 out of 538 electors to win the presidency.<br><br>But, of course, the United States does not use this system anymore, so what happened to it? Well, attempts to get rid of the Electoral College date back as far as the 1960s, when Richard Nixon won an election by 110 electoral votes despite only winning 1% more actual votes than his main opponent, Hubert Humphrey. The debate was brought up again after the 2000 election in which Democrat Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College to Republican George W. Bush due to a close race in Florida. However, these proposals were not able to make it into the Constitution, and many believed that the idea of abolishing the Electoral College was impossible.<br><br>That was until 2008, when no candidate was able to get a majority of electoral votes and the election was thrown to Congress to decide. When even Congress was too split to decide a President, people realized that they had enough, and what would become the Twenty-Eighth Amendment was brought to Congress. With both sides finally accepting that the Electoral College needed to be replaced, the Amendment quickly passed both houses of Congress and was ratified by two-thirds of the states on April 14, 2010.</p>`);
