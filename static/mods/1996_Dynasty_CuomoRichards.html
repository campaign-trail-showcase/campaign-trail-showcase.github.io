President Biden has issued a statement congratulating D'Amato on his victory, saying that despite their differences, he knows the governor will continue to work for the people of New York tirelessly. D'Amato reportedly attributes his victory to the large amount of Italian-American Democratic voters crossing the aisle to vote for him, just as we saw in the 1994 election when he unseated Governor Cuo-'</p><p>You turn of the TV and sit on the couch, staring at the black screen silently. You wonder how different things would be if you had taken your '94 race seriously. You could have won your fifth term tonight, or perhaps you'd be sitting in the Oval Office sending out congratulations. You try not to think about it. Matilda comes in an a little while later and you discuss getting the kids together for a family dinner, like how it used to be. It's a little harder now with Andrew working in Biden's cabinet (you try not to think of that as an appointment made out of pity), but you know he'll find the time.</p><p>President Biden would go on to win a second term in 2000 against Senator McCain, albeit by greatly reduced margins compared to his '96 win. During his term, we'd see an intervention in Bosnia and later, a minor conflict in Iraq aided by NATO member states. Domestically, an expansive crime bill is passed which you come to disapprove of. Less controversially, the federal budget is balanced and Biden exits office generally well-liked. Vice President Kerry would go on to win a term of his own in 2004, but by then you're more focused on other affairs. Since your loss in 1994 you returned to the private sector and have authored several books, giving speeches every now and then until your death in 2015. You are commemorated by former presidents Biden and Kerry, President DeWine, and yes, former Governor D'Amato.

Also celebrating tonight is Senator Ferraro, who won a full term of her own over Republican challenger-'</p><p>The noise from the television is drowned out by the cheering at the campaign headquarters, with yourself cracking a wide smile. Even after your loss in '94 and Biden's fumbling of '96, it seems good things come to those who wait. You couldn't be more proud as you watch Andrew give his victory speech in front of a roaring crowd at Gantry Plaza, and you hug Matilda tightly as tears roll down her cheeks. D'Amato's concession speech, coupled with President Quayle's muted congratulations, makes this all the more sweet of a victory for your family.</p><p>When the year 2000 came along, it seemed as though the Democratic Party was getting it's act together as Jay Rockefeller and Bill Bradley battled for the presidential nomination, only for Senator Paul Wellstone to take the primaries by storm. Establishment Democrats feared for the worst as President Quayle announced he would not be running for a second term, resulting in Donald Rumsfeld securing the Republican nomination. As the general election heated up however, Rumsfeld's attacks on Wellstone were largely disregarded due to both the distrust of the former, and the fatigue the average voter had for the Republican Party after 20 years in Washington. President Wellstone would go on to win re-election in 2004 over Bill Janklow by a large margin.</p><p>Past that though, it doesn't really matter much to you. Andrew serves as governor for three terms, stepping down in 2009 to accept a cabinet position in President Bayh's administration. When you pass away in 2015, you leave the world knowing that your son is exploring a run of his own in 2016. You regret that you'll not live to see the end result, but you are at peace knowing your family legacy lives on.</p>";

The White House has not yet made an official statement on Campbell's resignation, but inside sources claim that this was a long time coming, and President Gephardt is said to be in the process of selecting a new nominee for the now vacant position already.'</p><p>You sit in disbelief at the news, and let out a short chuckle before the gravity of the situation sets in. A vice president hasn't resigned in 25 years, not since Agnew, but the political ramifications of this move are as of yet unknown. If Campbell does switch parties, it'd no doubt be even more embarrassing for Gephardt than this whole thing already is. You realize why he did it now, only after seeing the results of the midterm - he was waiting to see if it would be politically advantageous for him to do so. After seeing the bloodbath this year, you're glad you decided not to run for a fifth term; you've probably spared yourself some embarrassment of your own. Nobody knows what this means going forward, but this can't be good for Gephardt's re-election prospects...</p><p>As for yourself, despite having lost an easy path to the presidency, you're pleased with your career. Sixteen years of public service to the state of New York has made you a deeply respected figure, and while some talk of a future presidential run, you laugh off the idea and continue to enjoy your retirement from politics. You return to the private sector for the next fifteen years until your death in 2015. Thousands of citizens flood the streets to pay their respects during your funeral procession, and your passing is commemorated by former presidents Gephardt, McCain, Obama, and both the Bush presidents.

All things considered, you think, Weld is a fine man, even if he was trying to take your job. The real highlight is what this victory signifies for you personally; aside from of course getting four more years in Albany, you will also take your place in history as the longest serving governor in American history. Despite it all, through all the years, you're still New York's favorite son. President Rockefeller phones you that same evening and extends his congratulations, and the two of you speak for a few more minutes before you return to the victory celebration.</p><p>The day your sixth term expires on December 31, 2006, you've served 24 years as governor of New York. Lazio, that kid Andrew beat for the Senate back in 2000, ends up being the one to succeed you, probably because you've just ended a quarter century Democratic administration. Once the war started in early 2010 though, you knew his goose was cooked when he started vocally criticizing his own party. You largely retire altogether, aside from helping out with Andrew's re-election bid in 2012, and pass away peacefully right at the start of 2015. Your funeral is watched by tens of thousands of people, with former presidents Rockefeller and Huckabee attending, as well as President O'Malley.

'Mario Who?' buttons became a staple of the GOP garb this fall, Quayle had free reign over all the swing states, you were constantly mocked for your absence on the trail, but even despite all that, you still came out ahead.</p><p>The consequences of this strategy are apparent, though, as several Senate seats in the South flipped to the Republicans. Thankfully, at least, a few incumbent Republicans up north were unseated, such as Bob Smith of New Hampshire by the unfortunately named Dick Swett, Gordon Smith of Oregon to the political newcomer Tom Bruggere, and most notably Quayle's running mate, Larry Pressler, who was unseated by a large margin going up against Represenative Tim Johnson.

Even Perot is spared the spoiler label, as it doesn't take a political expert to deduce what caused this.</p><p>The salt on this festering wound would have to be Congress, however. Several vulnerable Democratic incumbents were unseated this year, despite the national environment, and most vulnerable Republicans managed to hold on to their seats. Vice President-elect Larry Pressler did manage to win re-election to his Senate seat in South Dakota, but given that he will be entering the Naval Observatory, there will have to be a special election held soon for his soon to be vacant seat. Still, despite this sliver of hope, it's unlikely it will amount to much. As for yourself, your name is practically poison to most of your party due to your missteps. You still have your governorship, but it's very likely this will be your final term.
