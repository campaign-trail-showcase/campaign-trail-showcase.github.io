Nearly 3 decades of diligent service in the US Capitol has led Leahy to see nail biters dating back to the days of Nixon up into comfortable victories in the Democratic pheonix of 1992, but he now stands with great Democratic establishment support and a deep bond with generations of Vermonters.  But even less stands in the way of Leahy’s likely challenger.Jack McMullin has made his fortune in Massachusetts but sauntered on up for the explicit purpose of challenging for public office from his Burlington apartment and tourist trap ski resorts. McMullin’s lack of seniority runs many GOP faithful the wrong way, but they can almost certainly look past it to send their candidate to face off against the man marked for death so many times by the national Republican Party.",

But 1996 brought with it great change for both politics and Mr. Tuttle’s own twilight. A good neighbor by the name of John O’Brien made the decision to cast the eccentric dairyman in his independent film lampooning the political process, which would quickly become a cult hit all across Vermont. In no time, Tuttle would begin to pop up on ballots from high bailiff to President, and a lightbulb went off in O’Brien’s head: what if he turned fiction into reality in 1998? In order for the unlikely hero to endure electorally, there would need to be a true villain to root against. A challenge to Bernie Sanders was but a fleeting thought in John’s mind before Jack McMullin took himself and his millions to Burlington, an easy target in stature and appearance. Unfortunately, O’Brien is but a broke filmmaker and a creative mind, and will have to act diligently to match the spending of McMullin.</p>",
