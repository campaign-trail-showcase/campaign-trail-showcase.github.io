His time in the House has been uncontroversial with him being a standard Democrat in a conservative. He has shown fiscal conservatism with a hint of being somewhat liberal on social issues. Besides that, Roy is also a obstetrician, having received his Doctor of Medicine in 1949 from Northwestern University and his residency soon after, and he joined the Air Force for 2 years. He then practiced medicine before his entry in politics in 1970 as already discussed.\n<br><br>Now normally, someone like Roy would not have a shot at defeating a popular incumbent like Dole, however, Roy has the perfect opportunity. Public backlash towards the Watergate Scandal has propelled numerous Democrats towards many competitive races. It also helps Roy that Dole was Chairman of Republican National Committee during Watergate. That being said, victory will not be easy. Kansas hasn't elected a Democrat to the Senate in 40 years as well as having only carried the state 2 times during that same period. However, if Roy plays his cards right, he may be able to pull this off.",
