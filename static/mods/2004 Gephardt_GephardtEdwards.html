<b> DICK GEPHARDT BEATS GEORGE BUSH</b>

<p> It was close, but you did it. As you watch the map turn a kaleidoscope of red and blue-the safe states slotted into their usual columns, you begin to overtake Bush. While the swing states were close, by 11, CNN projects your victory. By 2 AM, only Fox holds out-too close to call, they say. But it won't be another 2000. Despite whatever they may try to throw at you, you are the victor. Luxuriate in it. Whatever they do, they can't stop it-come January, you will be the president. </p>`;

<b> DICK GEPHARDT BEATS BUSH IN LANDSLIDE</b>

<p> You've done it, and it wasn't even close! George W. Bush has been overwhelmingly rejected by the American people. Sit back and drink in the applause. Given your margin of victory, the Democrats and now-speaker Pelosi are expected to keep the house, and Daschle is expected to take over the Senate leadership yet again. With the election of the 2nd Missourian president, America will truly be stronger at home, and respected abroad.</p>`;

<b> BUSH NARROWLY WINS REELECTION</b>

<p> Well. All that work. Your toil, your years of preparations-gone. The 2nd Bush, the black sheep of the family, reelected. At least it was close. Perhaps the Dems can hold on to the house with some luck, but your career as a politician is seemingly over.

<b> A TIE?</b>

<p> Wow! For the first time in nearly 200 years, neither candidate has secured an electoral college majority. You sit and mull over the possibilities. Maybe if you'd tacked to the right to pick up more moderates, or tried harder to win over Nader voters, or done this, or that.</p>

<p> But either way, what's done is done. while the house races have yet to be called, the contingent election is going to decide the next president. Get ready to flex your muscles as former speaker-or see Bush get reelected. </p>`;

<b> BUSH WINS!</b>

<p> Well. All that work. Your toil, your years of preparations-gone. The 2nd Bush, the black sheep of the family, reelected. And in a landslide, at that! There's nothing more to say. Your career is essentially over. While few had expected a democratic win this year-after all, Kerry, Gore, and other party bigwigs all decided to sit this one out, it still stings to see such a huge turnout for Bush 42. </p>`;
