The act was spearheaded by President Exeon as a part of their \"Boy kissing\" initiative that saw massive support from the populace in their 2028 Campaign. </p>\n\n<p> The act requires that every first Monday of every month, all American citizens are required to go out and kiss at least 2 boys. While some scholars have argued that the act is unconstitutional, the Supreme Court has repeatedly struck down these arguments in cases such as <i> DeSantis v. Ethereal Shroom </i>. The act came under heavy fire from Conservative politicians, who believed it to be an \"attempt to enforce gay ideals on America\". This would single-handedly spur Greg Abott to run for President in 2032 on the platform of repealing the law; although his campaign did not attain the nomination of his party, it paved the way for his position to become the Republican mainstream. </p>",
