The oval office, already rapt in a thin silence in anticipation of oblivion at the hands of the enemy now found itself drowning in it as the night unfolded. The results which trickled onto the small television screen tucked neat and obscure in the corner of the room as if to shelter the president from his oncoming annihilation had betrayed the premonitions of the President's inner circle. They did not speak. They could not speak. Even the pundits which briefly flashed onto the display between ballot drops remained mum or offered up unconvincing reassurances of a Blue Mirage which only grew louder as the magnitude of the victory they were witnessing became apparent. It was impossible. Unfathomable, even. Though more divided than ever, the American people seemed united by a single, unshakable conviction that this outcome was impossible.</p><p>All except one. The president watched as his loyalists stilled, one by one, as what they were witnessing finally became too much to deny. Their faces had turned ashen white. Their gazes had been firmly affixed earthwards to avoid his own, but it did not phase him. The intransigence of his underlings had meant nothing, their incompetence laid bare as the levy broke and states began being called. When Blitzer, that rodent, murmured something about Kentucky being still too close to call it all finally began clicking into place.</p><p>The mainstream media was quick to change its tune and yet eons too late. FOX published a hailstorm of quickly-rescinded pre-written pre-scheduled eulogies alongside hastily scribbled together reports of unexpected strength in deep-red states which quickly morphed into descriptions of a massacre. Senator Vance mounted the stage in the moments before the first poll closures to deliver a resounding declaration of victory, of war against the liberal establishment. He begins sliding off script as his staffers issue him increasingly concerning reports of devastating swings across Appalachia as the results pour in over the first five minutes, begins sliding into accusations of voter fraud by ten. The tears begin flowing by minute fifteen, and his mascara starts running down his ruddy cheeks.</p><p>CNN scrambles to rework its programming as the night ticks on. The next Carter becomes the next Truman, then the next Obama, then the next Roosevelt. They say Joe Biden is paralysed, his body broken. They say Joe Biden is a sphinx; quiet, secretive. They say Joe Biden is Amtrak Joe, Scranton boy, hero of the working man. They say Joe Biden is a dead man walking come alive, another echo of his predecessor's once-certain defeat in 1936. They say Joe Biden is That Man In The White House once more. They say Joseph Robinette Biden is nothing less than another FDR.</p><p>Perhaps he is. Perhaps he is more.</p><p>His gaze transits the Oval Office, daring the small gaggle of supposed associates to break their monklike silence and recognise the victory unfolding before them. He knows what is to be done. He alone knows the day and the hour and the minute and the second of the coming of man, and he knows that it is now. He knows there shall be one in the bed and one in the field and one of two women grinding grain in the mill. His enemies have shown their faces now, and he knows he shall cut them asunder. He knows there will be weeping and the gnashing of the teeth, and he awaits it with glee. Nothing can stop them now.</p><p>...</p><p>And within the fraying body of the irish octogenarian... lay a mind... convinced that it was God.</p>`)

Safe states are called, the blue mirage begins pouring in from urban centers across the country. Biden had seen this play out for decades. He folded his hands in his lap and waited. People filtered in and out of the room, and still he waited. A handful of promising signs - Texas, Florida, Ohio, all too close to call. But the rural vote would trickle in, and the red mirage would start to seep into the projections. Biden was confident it would all balance out in his favor, but he braced himself for that inevitable dip, for that surge of rural voters that would put them in dire straits for a few hours. He knew the drill.</p><p>The minutes ticked on, the rural vote was coming in, but the blue mirage wasn’t fading. At least, not fast enough to put the race in jeopardy. Biden watched the screen carefully, almost suspicious of what he was seeing unfold. The other shoe was going to drop. It must be coming. He hadn’t seen an election night like this since, what? 2008? And the national spirit had been so different then. So optimistic, so hopeful. Not at all like he had seen these past few months. Could the American people really be feeling this way?

(AP)</b> - Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava won the race to succeed Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Tuesday in a sweeping victory over Republican Matt Gaetz, becoming both the first woman to become Governor of Florida, and the first Democrat in nearly three decades.</p><p>Cava’s victory marks a reversal of Florida’s rightward shift, with many Democrats hoping her focus on issues impacting Florida’s funding of affordable housing programs and environmentalism can be a blueprint towards being competitive once again in the sunshine state.</p><p>“Instead of boxing with shadows for two terms, I hope to make life better for everyone here in Florida. We will amend the broken insurance system that leaves our families vulnerable. We will do our part in stopping the climate trends that have led to our state being the home turf for hurricanes,” Cava told her supporters during her victory speech, “and we will truly create an equitable Florida for all.”</p><p>In the lead-up to the election, DeSantis’ administration faced crisis after crisis. With the collapse of the insurance market in Florida and the state lacking the funds to properly assist homeowners through the state’s insurance program, Florida briefly entered bankruptcy. The teacher’s strike of 2025 put another setback in DeSantis’ second term, with teachers demanding more academic freedom in the face of DeSantis’ “anti-woke crusade” and attempts to fire large numbers of teachers. Political commentators have long suggested that the struggles of DeSantis’ administration led to Former Representative Matt Gaetz triumphing over Representative Byron Donalds and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez.</p><p>Despite winning by a relatively wide margin, Governor-Elect Cava will have to work with solid Republican majorities in both chambers of the Florida legislature. Split-ticket voting was unusually high in this election, likely due to the Department of Justice bringing charges against Gaetz during the campaign.</p><p>“I’m generally a fan of conservative ideas,” one voter explained to AP News following the election, “but Gaetz is just a bridge too far. I’d hate to see him run this state even further into the ground than DeSantis.”</p><br><br><p><i>----</i><br>Learn more about the issues and factors at play in the midterms at <a href'https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections'>https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections</a></p><p><i>----</i><br>And follow the AP’s election coverage of the 2026 elections at <a href'https://apnews.com/hub/2026-midterm-elections'>https://apnews.com/hub/2026-midterm-elections</a>.</p><p><i>----</i><br>Associated Press reporter Sam Meyer contributed from Orlando, Florida.</p>`)

But so were the specs of the last phone Microsoft attempted, and it never caught onto the global market.</p><p>So, what's different this time, other than the presence of artificial intelligence? Burgum has claimed that this will not be a new "Windows phone" but will feature a new operating system built from the ground up to be intuitive, capable, and designed around artificial intelligence. Although some have derided Microsoft's re-entry into the smartphone market (a clip of former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer predicting the failure of the iPhone in 2007 made the rounds online recently), the picture painted by Burgum is giving industry insiders serious pause.</p><p>The CoPilot Genesis' AI is apparently '500 times as capable as competitors' - likely referring to Apple Intelligence, which is a part of the Siri ecosystem. Burgum goes on further to talk about how advanced the predictive system is - after only a few months of learning, the phone can practically 'read your mind' - or so he says. The best part? Burgum announced the price at the event - the CoPilot Genesis will launch at only $700, hundreds of dollars cheaper than the current iPhone 18 on store shelves. </p><p>This bombshell of an announcement puts the pressure on Apple - due to release a new phone next month, to respond. Apple, which has been struggling somewhat in the phone market, is set to release either the iPhone 19 or the iPhone 20/XX next month (There have been conflicting reports about <i>what</i> this new phone will be called). In any case, Apple, the dominant phone manufacturer should be prepared for battle with Microsoft.</p>`)

The number of wage and salary workers belonging to unions, at 20.5 million, also showed strong signs of growth. In 1983, the first year for which comparable data are available, the union membership rate was 20.1 percent and there were 17.7 million union members.</p><p>These data on union membership are collected as part of the Current Population Survey (CPS), a monthly sample survey of about 60,000 eligible households that obtains information on employment and unemployment among the nation’s civilian noninstitutional population age 16 and over. For further information, see the Technical Note in this news release.</p><p><b>Highlights from the 2027 data:</b></p><ul><li>The union membership rate of public-sector workers (40.3 percent) continued to be significantly higher than the rate of private-sector workers (11.5 percent). (See table 3.)</li><li>The highest unionization rates were among workers in education, training, and library occupations (50.3 percent) and protective service occupations (43.6 percent). (See table 3.)</li><li>Women have, for the first time since we’ve collected gender-segregated data, achieved a higher rate of unionization (15.3 percent) than men (13.4 percent). (See table 1.)</li><li>Black workers remained more likely to be union members than White, Asian, and Hispanic workers. (See table 1.)</li><li>Nonunion workers had median weekly earnings that were 85 percent of earnings for workers who were union members ($1,138 versus $1,337). (The comparisons of earnings in this news release are on a broad level and do not control for many factors that can be important in explaining earnings differences.) (See table 2.)</li><li>Among states, Ohio, Hawaii, and New York had the highest union membership rates (35.4 percent, 30 percent, and 23.3 percent, respectively), while the lowest rates were in North Carolina (3.3 percent), South Dakota (4.6 percent), and South Carolina (5.1 percent).

That includes China and the European Union, which will be levied new duties of 34% and 20%, respectively.</p><p>Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement did little to clear the dense fog of uncertainty. And even more tariffs by sector are coming down the pike, senior White House officials said Wednesday on a phone call with reporters. Here are key takeaways from Trump’s sweeping tariff hike.</p><h4>New tariffs have entered the chat</h4><p>Trump’s so-called reciprocal tariffs won’t match the ones foreign countries impose on the United States unless a country already had a 10% US tariff. They also won’t stack on top of existing duties by sector.</p><p>“We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us, so the tariffs will be not a full reciprocal,” Trump said from the Rose Garden on Wednesday afternoon. “I could have done that, I guess, but it would have been tough for a lot of countries and we didn’t want to do that.”</p><h4>American businesses are bracing for the fallout</h4><p>Tariff hikes inflict higher costs on US-based importers, which are typically passed on to American businesses. Many of them said on Wednesday they’re bracing for the fallout of Trump’s latest actions.</p><p>“It’s concerning, it’s going to be expensive, it’s going to require us all to make decisions,” Benjamin Colvin, president and co-founder of Devil’s Foot Brewing in Asheville, North Carolina, said Wednesday at a news conference with other business owners in the state. Colvin said that his company, which produces craft sodas and zero-proof cocktails, has already seen production costs ratchet higher since Trump slapped tariffs on aluminum and steel.</p>`)

She will have a morning cabinet meeting before embarking on a pre-planned diplomatic trip to Brussels. At the meeting, she is expected to notify the cabinet on the decisions she had made.</p><p>The lingering drama to keep in mind is the continuing tension between Haley’s reinvigorated, traditional wing of the GOP, and the populist faction still led by Trump. Both sides of the party have continued to blame one another for the staggering losses in the midterm elections.</p><p><b>Follow along with us live:</b></p><p>______________________________________________________</p><p><b>[10:30 AM]</b> - The Associated Press is reporting that Toomey is out as Secretary of Commerce.

Additionally, Christie is out as Attorney General. Christie being out isn't really a surprise - he was always a black sheep in the cabinet, and the struggle to get him confirmed probably cost Haley a lot of political capital she couldn't afford to lose.</p><p><b>[11:22 AM]</b> - Unconfirmed reports that <b>Bob Corker is out as Secretary of State</b>. A mid-term replacement of a Secretary of State is quite an unusual feat, but it would be a massive political victory for Trump and his allies if this is the case.</p><p><b>[11:45 AM]</b> - It appears that the Cabinet meeting has now concluded. Rumors that Burgum is out as Energy Secretary seem to have been false. Haley will speak to the press shortly before departing.</p><p><b>[11:52 AM]</b> - President Haley has appeared at the press briefing room.

She argues that the midterms show a loss of confidence in her administration and has made changes needed to prove her willingness to listen to the public. </p><p><b>[11:59 AM]</b> - During the end of her speech, Haley  mentions that Trump Jr. will be nominated for a cabinet position, although she does not clarify which one.

The former President is currently serving a prison sentence for crimes relating to the mishandling of classified documents and attempts to overturn the 2020 election.</p><p>The pardon, briefly mentioned by Burgum on the campaign trail during the 2024 election, is a key promise that helped him woo over Trump-leaning voters, and one that Trumpworld had lobbied for during Burgum's administration.</p><p>The pardon will also come after a string of struggles for Mr. Burgum, with the Republican Party still reeling from signifigant midterm losses in the 2026 election, in part due to independent and unaffiliated 'MAGA' candidates running splinter candidacies in key House and Senate races in Texas, North Carolina, Iowa, and Arizona, and Pennsylvania. It also comes from added pressure by Trumpworld, with Trump declaring during an interview in prison that 'he is not closing the door' on a 2028 bid.</p><p>However, it appears that the public is not on President Burgum's side on this issue - polling shows a lot of voters are unsure about their thoughts of a pardon, but when asked a few weeks ago in our latest NYT/Siena poll, only 35% of voters said that the President <i>should</i> pardon Trump, compared to 45% who said he <i>should not</i> pardon the former President.</p><p>It is expected that President Burgum will announce the pardon later today in a televised speech, one in which he will attempt to frame the pardon as a necessary push for national unity.</p>`)

However, there comes a point where you need to face the music about your politics and party, and for us at UAW, it was this year.</p><p>I have no idea how we went from President Biden walking picket lines in 2023 to having President Cooper help break strikes in 2031 – just after midterms by the way. Did Democrats seriously think <i>Union Voters</i>, their long time allies, were the reason they were losing?</p><p>For a long time, the Democrats have been shifting from a party for the working class to a party for the same rich assholes that control the Republicans, and also happen to own the New York Times. Since my time as President is over I’ll say this – we really swallowed our pride when endorsing President Cooper in 2028. We were worried about a Democrat from a right-to-work state ushering in the next Taft-Hartley, but we wanted to work with our allies either way. We were right to be worried, and wrong to trust the Democrats. I lost my seat at the table by sticking my neck out for Democrats who were unwilling to stick their necks out for us.</p><p>Unions have been under attack for decades since Taft-Hartley. The NLRB has been stripped of whatever teeth it had, and trumped up charges of corruption are used the moment union leadership gets uppity while Congresspeople and Supreme Court Justices regularly take free vacations from billionaires.</p><p>Unions are done just being a political force for the Democrats with no investment.</p><p>If you don’t compete for blue collar voters on economic issues, they’ll vote based on social issues. As someone from a UAW family, who worked in the plants myself, a lot of those people are socially moderate, even conservative. Democrats cannot win union voters without either supporting unions or selling their other constituents down the river. Unless they’re looking to return to being a party of the South, New York State and occasionally the midwest, it is in their best interest to wake the fuck up.</p><p>Personally, I wouldn’t settle for anything less than a repeal of Taft-Hartley at this point.</p>`)

Nevertheless, here we go.</p><p>President Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recently announced that he will be meeting with a series of social media influencers in order to promote healthy lifestyles. Among these, most famously, are the 'Costsco Guys' and 'The Rizzler', who have become close collaborators over the past few years. </p><p>For those wondering, The Rizzler is a seven-year-old boy named Christian who went viral in 2023 for a funny move that is called the 'rizz face', where he strokes his chin and purses lips. Many deem this move to have 'rizz' - which is short for charisma, and it seems the President is looking to take advantage of his 'rizz'.</p><p>While not related to the two, The Rizzler began to collaborate with two other influencers - the Costco Guys. The Costco Guys are a father-and-son combo - made up of son Big Justice and father AJ. AJ was an amateur wrestler before he began making a series of TikTok videos with his son, where they review items from Coscto and give them a "BOOM" if they deem them worthy.</p><p>But why is President Kennedy meeting with these influencers? The White House has given the usual remarks - that Kennedy has a message he needs to spread to all Americans, even in 'unconventional' ways.</p><p>Of course, the President currently has a low approval rating - floating around 37% as of right now, with many unsatisfied about his stances on vaccinations and dietary habits in America.

Jake Sullivan, in a statement, however dismissed this and claimed that Biden came to the decision on his own terms, largely in order to allow him to continue his work regarding ''solving the foreign policy crises in Ukraine and Israel''.</p><p>Likewise, John Podesta called it ''asinine'' that the book made the claim that Harris had first brought up Biden resigning in June of 2026, months before the 2026 midterms, over fears that Republicans would wipe out Democrats nationally, instead claiming that Harris' decision to oust Biden in October of 2026 was ''a sudden and cynical turnaround that came out of nowhere''.</p><p>Jill Biden, the widow of the former President who passed in December of 2026 - just weeks after his 84th birthday, and months after his removal as President of the United States - has remained quiet about the book, however.

It seemed that at the time, for better or for worse, enough of the nation put aside collective concerns about his mental and physical wellbeing to ensure that `+ opLast + ` did not win a term in the White House.</p><p>It was wrong, however, to outright reject or gaslight the public about these issues that had sprung up ever since he announced his original campaign in 2019. This collective denial has turned into a spiral of chaos and shock following the recent news that the President will be in a wheelchair going forward. Biden had, through many ways, regained the trust of Americans. He had not righted the ship, but had made progress in the last few years of his term. Americans placed this trust in the fact that they believed Biden would not have run if he did not believe he was up to the task of serving for four more years.</p><p>The news that Biden will remain in a wheelchair, at least to the public, is all the more shocking because of this. But it should not shock people. His team lied about his condition, covered it up under the guise of ''defending democracy''. And when we chose to re-elect him with little to no opposition, we became guilty in that coverup too.</p><p>The question now is pretty straightforward: What happens next? Do we see actual pushback from Congressional leaders such as Speaker Hakeem Jeffries on this matter? Does Harris and the cabinet invoke the 25th Amendment?</p><p>The next questions is more long-term: What have we done? How will America react?</p><p>Unfortunately, I believe I know the answer. I believe we have opened a Pandora's box that we cannot shut. America has made a mistake, and those who have enabled him in one form or another - whether by covering up his errors, voting for his renomination, or continuing the lie that Biden was fit to serve - have permanently shattered whatever trust Americans have placed in the political system.</p><p>In attempting to stop the rise of right wing extremism, I believe we have only given them the final <i>casus belli</i> they need to destroy our institutions. We are living on borrowed time, and the re-election of Biden last year only allowed us as a country to spend a few extra years digging our grave.</p>`)

Despite it all, he managed a divided Democratic caucus with a thin majority remarkably well, cementing his place among some of the most effective congressional leaders in crisis.</p><p>“This has been a fragile moment in our country’s history,” Jeffries told NPR in an interview, “but I’m honored to have the privilege to guide us out of this turbulent moment and into the future. President Biden’s re-election has proven that our leadership has been working for the people.”</p><p>While Democrats have increasingly become split between the progressive, liberal, and moderate wings of the party, Jeffries has taken a page out of Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s book, of balancing interests and whipping votes as needed to overcome the problem of a slim majority.</p><p>When we asked Jeffries about his similar leadership style, he said that “Pelosi was a mentor of mine for a while, with her being the first female Speaker of the House. Her management of the wide array of interests and ideologies within the Democratic caucus were effective, and her ability to broker compromises is legendary.”</p><h4>Pocketbook Issues, Housing on top of the House Democrats’ Agenda</h4><p>Jeffries’ mantra when it comes to his legislative focus is that Democrats have "... to make sure that we're focused on housing prices, food prices, gas prices, as well as health care costs, as major drivers of the expenses that everyday Americans confront." While some activists are disappointed at the sidelining of social issues, many Democrats approved of the approach.</p><p>Rep.

The following is a transcript of those remarks, as prepared by The New York Times.</i></p><p><b>FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:</b> To Joe’s loving family, to Jill, Hunter, Ashley, the many Biden grandchildren and great grandchildren, Vice President Harris and First Gentleman Emhoff, Mrs. Trump, President and Mrs. Bush, President and Secretary Clinton, Vice President and Mrs. Pence, Vice President Gore, Vice President and Mrs. Quayle, and the friends, family, and colleagues both from within and outside Washington-</p><p>It is with great sadness that I am up here speaking today. Joe Biden was a man who devoted himself with utmost pride and fervor to anything he set out for. He was a loving husband, a devoted father, and by far the most diligent public servant I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with.</p><p>People forget - Joe and I were not always the perfect team. Before we shared a ticket we had been opponents. He helped shape us into the leaders we are - and he did so with the utmost respect, dignity, and pride. He did the same in the U.S. Senate, where he served for over 3 and a half decades, holding our government to the highest standard of leadership we could muster.</p><p>When I decided to ask him to join my ticket in 2008, I knew deep down that I was making the best decision I would make in my entire time as President. Joe Biden was in a league of his own - diligent, resilient, warm. He had invaluable experience that, to date, with no offence to my colleagues in attendance, makes him possibly one of the most overqualified Presidents to ever serve the office.</p><p>He and I were different, no doubt. There were many times where I found myself in awe at how easily he could speak to anyone, and how unwaveringly candid he was while doing so. There were times when he would speak up about things that even I found it hard to stand up for.</p><p>That really speaks to who Joe was as a leader. Those of us who knew him well knew even in his old age there was an unquenchable fire for justice, for doing the right thing. That fire fueled every decision he made as Senator, Vice President, and eventually as President. He wasn’t concerned about what made him the most electable - he was concerned with what was best for the American people. For anyone who has held this office or any office of leadership, you know - that’s a difficult position to be in. But Joe never wavered from what he thought was right.</p><p>In his time as Vice President, he and I have both often mentioned that he would be the last man in the room when making decisions. It’s the same relationship he would later have with his own Vice President. I can honestly say, those were some of the most important, and the most valuable moments of my Presidency. It was those moments that assured me not only that I’d made the right call in asking him to join my administration, but also that I had made a lifelong friend. For all the errors I made during my presidency - and heaven knows there’s plenty of folks out there who say I made a lot of them - I owe many of my successes and victories to his advice and support.</p><p>It’s the kind of wisdom that only comes from having been around the block a few times. Joe Biden had been in politics for longer than most of us here, had seen ten different administrations come and go during his political career. And in that time, Joe had overcome hardships that very few of us have had to face, and hopefully never will.</p><p>From the very start of his life as a public servant, Joe faced challenges. Before he could even be sworn in for the first time, he had to try and cope with the pain and grief of losing his wife Neilia and daughter Amy, and becoming a single father of two boys. Most people would have hit a wall right then and there, but not Joe. He managed to rise to being both a single dad and a Senator, and he never let himself drop the ball in either arena. That takes the kind of strength of character that only the best of us possess.</p><p>That strength didn’t just define who he was as a person but as a leader. He was grounded, in a way that a lot of us in Washington tend to lose touch from. He didn’t let partisan lines define people - he took a person at who they were, not their affiliation, and during his time in congress he managed to make countless friendships on both sides of the aisle, which you can tell just by the people in attendance here today. He believed in common decency, that the people in the other party weren’t your enemy, they just had different priorities. Through that, he did his best to serve not just the people who voted for him, but every American, to ensure no one felt left behind by their government. </p><p>Joe wasn’t the perfect man or the perfect leader, but he believed fiercely in the promise of America. He believed in standing by our allies, by our people, and by our values. Even in the rockiest moments of his career, he has had a fierce belief in the good of the American people. It was this belief that led to him running for President in 1988. It was what led him to join my ticket two decades later. It was this belief that helped him make the difficult decision to stand aside in 2016 - a decision to leave the fight to the rest of us while he spent a bit more time with his son Beau before he passed. </p><p>And when I say “fight,” let me be clear - I don’t mean fighting against another candidate or party. I mean the fight for the American people. Joe didn’t believe in “us vs. them”. He believed in “us and them”. That’s why he decided to come back and run again in 2020 - so he could start bringing the people together. Because he knew better than most that a united front is the only way through a crisis.</p><p>Y’know, Joe didn’t outright say it much, but he took a lot of inspiration from his predecessors when making decisions. Not me, of course - he learnt a lot more from my screw ups, I think. But there were other Presidents, like Kennedy or Lyndon Johnson, that he really aspired to. I think he was most inspired by Franklin Roosevelt, as evidenced by the portrait he kept over the fireplace in the oval. Anyone who takes up the mantle of the presidency knows he or she has big shoes to fill, and all of us want to leave a legacy that lives up to the greats.</p><p>Not all of us can live up to that legacy, and not all of us are remembered for what we want to be remembered for - don’t I know - but I think in Joe’s case, he’d be proud of the legacy he’s leaving behind. He may not have done it with the same pomp as some of our fellow presidents, but I know that when I think of his time in office, I will remember how he pulled us out of the depths of a pandemic and left us with rock solid support to our economy, workforce, military, and country. In that way, I can honestly say that Joe lived up to the legacies that he had once aspired to.</p><p>So when I remember Joe Biden, I’ll not only think of the loving father, husband, and friend, but also the great leader who never once turned his back on the American people.</p><p>To you, fellow guests, and the American people, I say God bless Joe Biden, God bless the country he served so devotedly, and God Bless the President.</p><p>To Joe, I say “yes we can”, and yes, you did.</p>`)

Although the initial selection process was rushed for time, the two have had a good personal rapport and a friendship that has become far too uncommon in modern Presidential administrations. Harris has kept Walz involved and in the loop on practically every major decision she has made - from healthcare to foreign policy, and has taken his feedback into account.</p><p>With Harris bogged down hammering out a multilateral defense treaty in the Pacific - including Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand - the President has had little time to campaign during the midterms. She’s delegated much of it to Walz, and it appears to be paying off; The Cook Political Report has changed their rating in the open Pennsylvania’s Senate race, with 2024 runner-up Dave McCormick (R) and Congresswoman Susan Wild (D), from Tossup to Leans Democratic, likely giving Democrats a crucial hold and Pennsylvania’s first female Senator. Incumbents in other swing states - Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Arizona also appear to be in fairly comfortable positions as well, although many of them had razor-tight races in 2024 after polls showed them leading.</p><p>Still, there is a mutual doubt between the Harris and Walz camp about whether or not Mr. Walz should run in 2032 - although allies of both Harris and Walz have very different reasons for this decision.</p><p>In Kamalaworld, many of the top advisors to the President believe Mr. Walz - who would be almost 70 when he takes the oath of office, would be too old to run for and serve two full terms. The doubts many had over Biden’s age during his sole term has made this aspect especially important for the President. Meanwhile, Walz’s close confidants have doubts about whether or not he would be able to win - him being quite tied to a President with a 44% approval rating means that a 2032 campaign would be a steep climb.</p><p>Of course, Walz hasn’t closed the door completely on a Presidential campaign. Harris herself seems open to the idea, and if she asks him to run - perhaps with a pledge to serve one term, it’s highly likely he would do so.</p>`)

Walz is reemerging after <font color="#1155cc"><u>last year’s election loss</u></font>, granting interviews to national media and speaking to hundreds attending the Montana Democratic Party’s annual dinner earlier this month.</p><p>Now, he’s kicking off a tour of town halls in competitive congressional districts represented by Republicans, launched by a post on social media in response to guidance from House Speaker Mike Johnson that GOP representatives <font color="#1155cc"><u>skip out on town halls</u></font>, saying demonstrations outside of them were the work of “professional protesters.” “There’s a responsibility in this time of chaos where elected officials need to hear what people are irritated about,” Walz said. “And I would argue that Democratic officials should hear the primal scream that’s coming from America and do something.”</p><p>Walz said he wasn’t there to personally attack U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn, whose district includes the high school auditorium that nearly 1,000 people filled on Friday. But Walz called on Nunn to answer questions in public. Nunn won reelection in Iowa’s 3rd congressional district by about 4 percentage points in 2024, a margin of just under 16,000 voters. The Iowa Democratic Party got Walz’s call Monday evening and got to work planning the event Tuesday, said Paige Godden, the state party’s communications director. The crowd gave Walz a standing ovation. Many were wearing shirts with messages of political activism. A schoolteacher, a high school senior and a VA medical center worker asked Walz questions about health care, financial aid and funding for veterans.</p><p>He goes Saturday to Nebraska, where he grew up, with tentative stops to follow in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Ohio. The focus on Midwest neighbors and states in the Rust Belt isn’t a coincidence - many of them are places Walz didn’t visit during last year’s shortened campaign after Biden dropped out and made way for Vice President Kamala Harris atop the Democratic ticket. Walz passed on running for Senate next year but could be a contender for the 2028 presidential nomination. On 2024’s outcome, Walz said Democrats “need to acknowledge” that some voters didn’t see a difference between the Republican and Democratic presidential tickets and that the Democrats’ message on issues like immigration and Social Security didn’t resonate. He said he’s listening to learn why. Andrea Smith, a veteran, and her 19-year-old daughter, Liberty, said they were already going to be in Des Moines - about 120 miles from home in West Branch - to rally for veteran’s rights, and they decided to stay to see Walz.</p><p>“We related a lot to him,” Liberty Smith said. “He felt real during the election season.” Showing up to the Walz event was May Dehaan’s way of trying to get Nunn to notice that his constituents are frustrated. She wore a shirt that read: “This is not normal.”“Obviously, he’s not listening to his constituents. He’s following the GOP talking points.” said Dehaan, a retired interior designer from suburban Clive, who has herself written to Nunn. “We’re getting tired of being ignored.”</p>`)

The margin currently stands at 50.3% of the vote for Mr. Davis, with 47.7% of the vote for Mrs. Garrity - a stark contrast to Mr. Shapiro's landslide margin four years prior.</p><p>It's not all bad news for Republicans - the party has appeared to have won back control of the State House of Representatives, held onto the State Senate, and flipped at least two Congressional District in the northeast - the 7th and 8th districts. Pennsylvania's 17th, a district comprising much of Pittsburgh's suburbs also is too close to call at this hour - incumbent Democrat Chris DeLuzio's lead has narrowed to under half a percentage and may continue to do so.</p><p>Although the election night was not perfect for Republicans, many believe that ousting Governor Davis was uncertain anyway, as he had "no firing offenses" according to one Republican strategist. Since taking office, Davis has laid low, continued Shapiro's bipartisan agenda, and steered clear of scandals and drama.</p><p>With such an uncontroversial Democrat only hanging on narrowly, many Republicans have now begun to salivate at the prospects of taking down Senator Fetterman in 2028. Fetterman has remained quite controversial with hardcore liberal Democratic constiuencies, and a portion of the grassroots seem interested in ousting him in a primary.</p><p>All the uncertainty here has top Republicans, both those in the state - such as Auditor DeFoor, York DA Dave Sunday, and those out of state - such as Senate Majority Leader John Thune - are waiting to see what unfolds during the primary process.</p>`)

  e.pages.push(`<h3>Governor Shapiro's Budget Proposal Sparks 2028 Discussions</h3><h4>January 2nd, 2027 | Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</h4><p>Governor Shapiro has just put out an expansive budget proposal, seeking to use much of the surplus funds accumulated over the decade on a variety of public projects - ranging from repairing roads, funding school lunches, expanding the social safety net, and expanding the rollout of legal cannabis. Why? </p><p>One easy guess, and a theory shared by many of our political analysts - is that Shapiro is looking to pad out his resume ahead of any potential 2028 presidential bid, especially amongst progressive groups. Universal school lunches, cannabis reform, and social welfare expansions are near goals for progressives. Many voters who identified as progressive during the last presidential cycle showed low enthusiasm for the selection of Governor Shapiro as Harris' running mate. Although they aren't a voting bloc that Shapiro would need to secure the nomination, securing the goodwill of the left may make the difference between the White House and returning to Harrisburg come 2029.</p><p>With the new State Senate being 26-24 for the Democratic Party, and Shapiro's budget ambitions may be less farfetched than previous cycles. The State Senate Majority Leader, Jay Costa, has indicated he would give Shapiro significant input in the budget process given "the mandate voters have given him to bring us together". So too has the expanded State House majority for Democrats - at 111 House Dems to 92 House Republicans - signaled they would accept most of Shapiro's proposals. Speaker McClinton, who defied all odds and held onto her position in the 2024 elections, has said she would back Shapiro's budget proposals just as she did in 2023, 2024, 2025, and 2026.</p><p>Pennsylvania Democrats are clearly riding on a wave of enthusiasm and joy - it's the first time since 1993 they've held a trifecta in the state, and the first time since 1976 that voters have given them a full mandate to govern the state (the trifecta in 1993 was as a result of party switching).</p><p>Some potential concerns with the budget may play themselves out. Republicans, of course, are seemingly unified in their opposition to the proposal, while murmurs exist of a "rebellion" of Democratic lawmakers opposed to Shapiro's ambitions attempting to battle the budget in its current state.</p>`)

You might think they couldn't be more different, but in Arizona, the answer is surprisingly simple.</p><p>This November, they're all going to vote for Kirsten Sinema.</p><p>It might be surprising to hear that the former Senator who held up much of the Biden Administration's legislation still has any political relevancy, but it seems that the social worker turned politician has tapped into an emerging source of political fortune.</p><p>"The technical term is syncretic populism," writes Danielle Alen, a political scientist from Harvard University. "It's something you see in countries where opportunities are limited and support for established governing institutions is low. Right now, many Americans want an outsider, but they want someone who can appeal to a variety of voters, and transcend the traditional left-right divide."</p><p>For Sinema, at least, it would seem that she fits this bill. Despite only launching her gubernatorial campaign a couple of months ago, a recent Ipsos poll put her at 31%, ahead of Republican Karrin Taylor Robson, and only a few points behind incumbent Katie Hobbs. And, in spite of both parties hurriedly funneling millions of dollars into the race, Sinema continues to gain ground.</p><p>In fact, according to some voters, increased advertising might actually be backfiring.</p><p>"You see a lot of campaign posters attacking Sinema now." says James Lopez, a resident of Phoenix and undecided voter. "But you go to one street corner, and you see one version of Sinema, and then you go to another street corner, and you see a completely different version of her. She hates immigrants, then she hates border security. She hates abortion, then she loves it. She wants to increase taxes, then she wants to cut them."</p><p>Whether these ads are working or not, Sinema remains unbowed, even going so far as to call out her rivals at a rally in Tuscon yesterday.</p><p>"You know, a lot of people who aren't from Arizona, who haven't even been to Arizona, are coming into this beautiful state and spreading lies. Lies about who I am, about what I stand for. So let me make this clear: I will not be controlled by Wall Street. I will not be controlled by the Californian Elite. I will not be controlled by the radical left and I will not be controlled by the radical right. The only people I will be controlled by are the voters and taxpayers of Arizona."</p><p>Whether or not the voters and taxpayers will stand with Sinema come November remains to be seen.</p>`)

But it’s not a conservative grassroots movement pressuring him to break from President Harris’s big-government “New Way Forward” spending bill - it’s from an apolitical social media influencer, who says he just “wants to meet his hero”.</p><p>Dan Hentschel is a social media influencer with 500,000 subscribers on YouTube and 700,000 followers on 𝕏 (formerly known as Twitter). He is known for his absurdist comedy, making videos where he plays a variety of different roles, from a Target employee getting fired for an inappropriate post, to a therapist who hates his clients. His legal record, of course, isn’t the cleanest - Hentschel was investigated by police after making a post where he claimed he planned on shooting up his high school many years ago.</p><p>Lately, one of Dan Hentschel’s “storylines” as his fans call them has saw him grow desperate and desperate to meet with the Vice President, making numerous calls out through his posts, including painting himself blue because “Phillips is his hero!!!!!”, and asking his fans to tag the Vice President so he can be acknowledged.</p><p>Eventually, the Vice President decided to meet with him - or the two at least crossed paths at an event in Nevada. Hentschel had his blue paint on, and began to shake hands with the Vice President, before embracing him suddenly. Quickly, the Secret Service rushed in to rescue the Vice President, doing so by grabbing Mr. Hentschel before tasing him into the ground.</p><p>The Vice President spoke at the event, meant to be heard by the local culinary unions, where he claimed to have been “attacked” today by someone he presumed was “a fan”, and someone he had planned on meeting. Even some Hentschel fans believe he went too far, with some on social media saying that a line was crossed, with @ItsAstronomics on 𝕏 said that “Dan prolly crossed the line here, feels very weird to just hug someone you’ve never met like that.”</p><p>The White House has not commented on the event yet, other than stating that they are grateful the Vice President is safe and are coordinating with local law enforcement on the matter.</p>`)

Castro, however, does not appear to be the candidate to defeat Harris - a recent CNN poll found 55% of primary voters backing Harris, followed by 27% backing Castro. The remaining 18% of voters gave other answers or remain undecided.</p><p>In any case, getting a new Vice President through the evenly divided United States Senate, let alone keeping the Senate in order, seems to be an impossible task - Castro's resignation means that the 50 Democratic Senators and the 50 Republican Senators must form either some kind of power-sharing agreement in order to keep the chamber going.

He was able to secure a victory for two reasons - firstly, by being able to highlight the accomplishments that his administration made, and secondly, by painting his opponent as party of the reason why the recovery had not landed perfectly.</p><p>To an extent, Harris was able to perform the second - she hammered on Trump's COVID response and the threats that he poses to Democracy, but she could not paint a picture of a vision.</p><p>Harris was not involved in the Biden administration - but when she was, it was the worst jobs. 'Border Czar', as they called her, was the only real 'responsibility' given.

The following is a transcript of those remarks, as prepared by The New York Times.</i></p><p><b>FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:</b> To Joe’s loving family, to Jill, Hunter, Ashley, the many Biden grandchildren and great grandchildren, President Harris and First Gentleman Emhoff, Mrs. Trump, President and Mrs. Bush, President and Secretary Clinton, Vice President and Mrs. Pence, Vice President Gore, Vice President and Mrs. Quayle, and the friends, family, and colleagues both from within and outside Washington-</p><p>It is with great sadness that I am up here speaking today. Joe Biden was a man who devoted himself with utmost pride and fervor to anything he set out for. He was a loving husband, a devoted father, and by far the most diligent public servant I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with.</p><p>People forget - Joe and I were not always the perfect team. Before we shared a ticket we had been opponents. He helped shape us into the leaders we are - and he did so with the utmost respect, dignity, and pride. He did the same in the U.S. Senate, where he served for over 3 and a half decades, holding our government to the highest standard of leadership we could muster.</p><p>When I decided to ask him to join my ticket in 2008, I knew deep down that I was making the best decision I would make in my entire time as President. Joe Biden was in a league of his own - diligent, resilient, warm. He had invaluable experience that, to date, with no offence to my colleagues in attendance, makes him possibly one of the most overqualified Presidents to ever serve the office.</p><p>He and I were different, no doubt. There were many times where I found myself in awe at how easily he could speak to anyone, and how unwaveringly candid he was while doing so. There were times when he would speak up about things that even I found it hard to stand up for.</p><p>That really speaks to who Joe was as a leader. Those of us who knew him well knew even in his old age there was an unquenchable fire for justice, for doing the right thing. That fire fueled every decision he made as Senator, Vice President, and eventually as President. He wasn’t concerned about what made him the most electable - he was concerned with what was best for the American people. For anyone who has held this office or any office of leadership, you know - that’s a difficult position to be in. But Joe never wavered from what he thought was right.</p><p>In his time as Vice President, he and I have both often mentioned that he would be the last man in the room when making decisions. It’s the same relationship he would later have with his own Vice President. I can honestly say, those were some of the most important, and the most valuable moments of my Presidency. It was those moments that assured me not only that I’d made the right call in asking him to join my administration, but also that I had made a lifelong friend. For all the errors I made during my presidency - and heaven knows there’s plenty of folks out there who say I made a lot of them - I owe many of my successes and victories to his advice and support.</p><p>It’s the kind of wisdom that only comes from having been around the block a few times. Joe Biden had been in politics for longer than most of us here, had seen ten different administrations come and go during his political career. And in that time, Joe had overcome hardships that very few of us have had to face, and hopefully never will.</p><p>From the very start of his life as a public servant, Joe faced challenges. Before he could even be sworn in for the first time, he had to try and cope with the pain and grief of losing his wife Neilia and daughter Amy, and becoming a single father of two boys. Most people would have hit a wall right then and there, but not Joe. He managed to rise to being both a single dad and a Senator, and he never let himself drop the ball in either arena. That takes the kind of strength of character that only the best of us possess.</p><p>That strength didn’t just define who he was as a person but as a leader. He was grounded, in a way that a lot of us in Washington tend to lose touch from. He didn’t let partisan lines define people - he took a person at who they were, not their affiliation, and during his time in congress he managed to make countless friendships on both sides of the aisle, which you can tell just by the people in attendance here today. He believed in common decency, that the people in the other party weren’t your enemy, they just had different priorities. Through that, he did his best to serve not just the people who voted for him, but every American, to ensure no one felt left behind by their government. </p><p>Joe wasn’t the perfect man or the perfect leader, but he believed fiercely in the promise of America. He believed in standing by our allies, by our people, and by our values. Even in the rockiest moments of his career, he has had a fierce belief in the good of the American people. It was this belief that led to him running for President in 1988. It was what led him to join my ticket two decades later. It was this belief that helped him make the difficult decision to stand aside in 2016 - a decision to leave the fight to the rest of us while he spent a bit more time with his son Beau before he passed. </p><p>And when I say “fight,” let me be clear - I don’t mean fighting against another candidate or party. I mean the fight for the American people. Joe didn’t believe in “us vs. them”. He believed in “us and them”. That’s why he decided to come back and run again in 2020 - so he could start bringing the people together. Because he knew better than most that a united front is the only way through a crisis.</p><p>Y’know, Joe didn’t outright say it much, but he took a lot of inspiration from his predecessors when making decisions. Not me, of course - he learnt a lot more from my screw ups, I think. But there were other Presidents, like Kennedy or Lyndon Johnson, that he really aspired to. I think he was most inspired by Franklin Roosevelt, as evidenced by the portrait he kept over the fireplace in the oval. Anyone who takes up the mantle of the presidency knows he or she has big shoes to fill, and all of us want to leave a legacy that lives up to the greats.</p><p>Not all of us can live up to that legacy, and not all of us are remembered for what we want to be remembered for - don’t I know - but I think in Joe’s case, he’d be proud of the legacy he’s leaving behind. He may not have done it with the same pomp as some of our fellow presidents, but I know that when I think of his time in office, I will remember how he pulled us out of the depths of a pandemic and left us with rock solid support to our economy, workforce, military, and country. In that way, I can honestly say that Joe lived up to the legacies that he had once aspired to.</p><p>So when I remember Joe Biden, I’ll not only think of the loving father, husband, and friend, but also the great leader who never once turned his back on the American people.</p><p>To you, fellow guests, and the American people, I say God bless Joe Biden, God bless the country he served so devotedly, and God Bless the President.</p><p>To Joe, I say “yes we can”, and yes, you did.</p>`)

There were times when he would speak up about things that even I found it hard to stand up for.</p><p>That really speaks to who Joe was as a leader. Those of us who knew him well knew even in his old age there was an unquenchable fire for justice, for doing the right thing. That fire fueled every decision he made as Senator, Vice President, and eventually as President. He wasn’t concerned about what made him the most electable - he was concerned with what was best for the American people. For anyone who has held this office or any office of leadership, you know - that’s a difficult position to be in. But Joe never wavered from what he thought was right.</p><p>In his time as Vice President, he and I have both often mentioned that he would be the last man in the room when making decisions. It’s the same relationship he would later have with his own Vice President. I can honestly say, those were some of the most important, and the most valuable moments of my Presidency. It was those moments that assured me not only that I’d made the right call in asking him to join my administration, but also that I had made a lifelong friend. For all the errors I made during my presidency - and heaven knows there’s plenty of folks out there who say I made a lot of them - I owe many of my successes and victories to his advice and support.</p><p>It’s the kind of wisdom that only comes from having been around the block a few times. Joe Biden had been in politics for longer than most of us here, had seen ten different administrations come and go during his political career. And in that time, Joe had overcome hardships that very few of us have had to face, and hopefully never will.</p><p>From the very start of his life as a public servant, Joe faced challenges. Before he could even be sworn in for the first time, he had to try and cope with the pain and grief of losing his wife Neilia and daughter Amy, and becoming a single father of two boys. Most people would have hit a wall right then and there, but not Joe. He managed to rise to being both a single dad and a Senator, and he never let himself drop the ball in either arena. That takes the kind of strength of character that only the best of us possess.</p><p>That strength didn’t just define who he was as a person but as a leader. He was grounded, in a way that a lot of us in Washington tend to lose touch from. He didn’t let partisan lines define people - he took a person at who they were, not their affiliation, and during his time in congress he managed to make countless friendships on both sides of the aisle, which you can tell just by the people in attendance here today. He believed in common decency, that the people in the other party weren’t your enemy, they just had different priorities. Through that, he did his best to serve not just the people who voted for him, but every American, to ensure no one felt left behind by their government. </p><p>Joe wasn’t the perfect man or the perfect leader, but he believed fiercely in the promise of America. He believed in standing by our allies, by our people, and by our values. Even in the rockiest moments of his career, he has had a fierce belief in the good of the American people. It was this belief that led to him running for President in 1988. It was what led him to join my ticket two decades later. It was this belief that helped him make the difficult decision to stand aside in 2016 - a decision to leave the fight to the rest of us while he spent a bit more time with his son Beau before he passed. </p><p>And when I say “fight,” let me be clear - I don’t mean fighting against another candidate or party. I mean the fight for the American people. Joe didn’t believe in “us vs. them”. He believed in “us and them”. That’s why he decided to come back and run again in 2020 - so he could start bringing the people together. Because he knew better than most that a united front is the only way through a crisis.</p><p>Y’know, Joe didn’t outright say it much, but he took a lot of inspiration from his predecessors when making decisions. Not me, of course - he learnt a lot more from my screw ups, I think. But there were other Presidents, like Kennedy or Lyndon Johnson, that he really aspired to. I think he was most inspired by Franklin Roosevelt, as evidenced by the portrait he kept over the fireplace in the oval. Anyone who takes up the mantle of the presidency knows he or she has big shoes to fill, and all of us want to leave a legacy that lives up to the greats.</p><p>Not all of us can live up to that legacy, and not all of us are remembered for what we want to be remembered for - don’t I know - but I think in Joe’s case, he’d be proud of the legacy he’s leaving behind. He may not have done it with the same pomp as some of our fellow presidents, but I know that when I think of his time in office, I will remember how he pulled us out of the depths of a pandemic and left us with rock solid support to our economy, workforce, military, and country. In that way, I can honestly say that Joe lived up to the legacies that he had once aspired to.</p><p>So when I remember Joe Biden, I’ll not only think of the loving father, husband, and friend, but also the great leader who never once turned his back on the American people.</p><p>To you, fellow guests, and the American people, I say God bless Joe Biden, God bless the country he served so devotedly, and God Bless the President.</p><p>To Joe, I say “yes we can”, and yes, you did.</p>`)
