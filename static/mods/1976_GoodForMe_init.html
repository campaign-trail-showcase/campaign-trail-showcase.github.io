Henry M. Jackson hopes to channel the energy of the Democrats’ 1974 midterm victory to return the party to the White House, but the shadow of Robert Kennedy still hangs over him. And Ronald Reagan, once a political “has-been,” is leading an independent bid with the backing of the conservative movement—and a real shot at power.<p> In this broken, strange, fast-moving world, can Lindsay hang on to his job a while longer, or is this the end of Republican liberalism once and for all?",

<p>I've always been fascinated by candidates who, though they belong to one party, seem unmistakably like members of the other. John Lindsay, Nelson Rockefeller, Jacob Javits&mdash;but also John Connally, Joe Lieberman, and George Wallace. It's a very American phenomenon, and it makes for a very interesting game. This mod (my first) is an attempt to use a scenario based on such a figure to create a fun, replayable game. I hope you enjoyed it.</p>
<p>I'd like to thank Thatchmaster (for the coding of the endings, especially the Wikipedia, the Newspapers and the Reddit ones), and ItsAstronomical (for the explanations in his codes and the tutorial) . Their code has been very helpful in tackling the hard work of modding, and any mistakes I made trying to emulate them are mine. I also want to thank obummer (for the codes on the soundtrack of the game and his displaying), Jet (for Jet's TCT Mod Tool, without this mod wouldn't have happened), and Tom1923 (for the campaign sign display).</p>
<p>And to the rest of you politics obsessives who made it this far, thank you for spending your time on this mini-project that kept me entertained for a few weeks. See you around.</p>`,

After a decade of consecutive defeats, Republicans sidelined their juiciest prospects—their Reagans and their Agnews—and nominated a New York liberal against Camelot’s second king. And what first looked like a sure loss turned into a remarkable campaign, especially after Robert Kennedy decided to impose Robert “Klansman” Byrd as vice president. Lindsay became the first Republican since Coolidge to win the presidency without a single vote from the former Confederacy. <p> Republicans cheered and danced on RFK’s grave, but the joy didn’t last. Whether it was the trip to China, the deals with Congress, the fall of Vietnam, or the presidential pardon for Kennedy, Republicans have learned to hate their leader. They hate him—and he knows it. The bigger question is: <i> Can a man win an election without the support of his own party?",
