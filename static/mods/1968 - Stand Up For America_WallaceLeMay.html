<p> <b> Sitting before the President-elect</b> was a man of many titles - The President, his boss, the slayer of segregation, the blood-guzzling warrior - yet, in this moment, he was Lyndon Baines Johnson, the frail man. His face was dull and lifeless. His natural features were highlighted by the stress he has been subjected to over the past five years. Kennedy's assassination, the Civil Rights movement, Goldwater, the riots, Vietnam, all of it showed on a single face. Such a brutal, prolonged molestation of a man could not be masked; not in public, and certainly not in private when such a facade is unnecessary. The thin glasses certainly don't make him seem stronger; if anything, their frame compliments his frailty.

<p> Their discussion thus far has been about one specific policy, close to the hearts of both of them: Vietnam. The President had made his displeasure over Humphrey's break-off known in private, threatening to derail his entire campaign. Yet, the moment the channels called the election for Humphrey, all that swag, carefully built up over decades, had vanished. He had no power over Humphrey. No matter what he said, pleaded, or threatened, in two months time, Humphrey would not have to listen to a damn word he had to say. Johnson didn't tell anyone it got to him; everyone could tell, rendering such an act pointless. </p>

<p> Still, there was something he could impart onto Humphrey.</p>

<p> "And that," Humphrey continued on, not noticing the President shifting his body, hinting that he was moving on to a new subject, "Johnson, is why I have to see through my pledges. If I don't, the party will be torn apart in the midterms, and then myself in 1972."

<p> Johnson shook his head. "Way I see it," he responded; Humphrey expected him to say something about how giving up on Vietnam would get him massacred harder. "You're doomed either way."

<p> Humphrey was taken aback. The President was so stalwart regarding his own plan and its inevitable success. There's no way he was admitting that, no matter what, Vietnam would doom both of them. 

<p> "Pardon?" He asked as he leaned forward over the table.

<p> "That Wallace thing's got you by the balls." Johnson explained, laxing himself in response. 

<p> "Well," Humphrey stammered, feeling as though personal pride was on the line - he had just beaten Wallace in an election, and insinuating he would be the downfall of the Democrats was personally insulting. "I think I've already shown that-"

<p> Johnson interjected. "No matter what you showed, Wallace displayed with pizzaz." Johnson flicked his hands up for extra flair. "He wooed over a lot of our core constituents. I got over sixty percent of the vote in Pennsylvania in '64. You barely notched it by a few points; did you see the numbers Wallace got in Pittsburgh? Philly?"

<p> Humphrey attempted to rebuke, opening with "Well, I can't be expected to-" but was interrupted.

<p> "Detroit? Milwaukee? Chicago? The suburbs? He won most of the damned south, for Christ's sake!" Johnsons admonished. Even after he signed the Civil Rights Act, he'd won more Southern states than Goldwater. Humphrey didn't even carry any outside of Texas. "No matter how you slice it, he's got us on something. Folks like him: the rhetoric, the policies, all of him."

<p> "Well then, what are you saying I do? See my presidency through as he would? Betray my principles just for a few more votes?"

<p> "I won't tell you to do a damn thing. I'm letting you know you gotta do something."

<p> Humphrey slunk back in his chair. He looked down at his lap, so as to not see the smug look on Johnson's face. Even a month away from being irrelevant, the President still had ways to make his life a living hell.`;
