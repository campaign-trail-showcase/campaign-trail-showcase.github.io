The unification and inter party strength he once fought for, shattered at his feet. In the eyes of the liberals he once stood beside, he is a compromising war hawk who is slow on the pulse of change-a lecturer rather than a leader. The Happy Warrior had become everything he once was not, and he would surely drop the election to Richard Nixon in a democratic nadir.<p>Then came the bombshell; one even bigger than the millions the President dropped all over Southeast Asia. Tricky Dick tried to swindle Lyndon Johnson out of a last ditch peace deal that would finally put an end to the suffering in Vietnam and leave both nations content. When the story exploded onto the front page of every major newspaper, the nation was rightfully disgusted by Nixon’s chicanery. But even that shameful sabotage was nearly not enough, as Illinois was only decided by one hundredth of a percentile. If only a few hundred Chicagoans had stayed home, that ghoul Wallace would have finally been able to realize his fantasy of power and control Humphrey as a puppet, upholstered in place of a true southern rights candidate.<p>  Now as president, Humphrey must face the unenviable task of mending the fabric of a country torn far beyond the Mason Dixon line, now ripped further. by the pains of war.</div>",

    <div style='width: 70%;text-overflow: ellipsis;text-align:center;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;'>
    <p>Thank you for taking a chance on the first CYOA of a mostly novice modder. This was an immense task, and even then there is some stuff I wanted to add that I could not figure out that I may come back to in time.</p>
    <p>Some of the candidates may seem a tad bit farfetched, but I attempted to try and make something that was not too derivative of what TTNW and PWH accomplished.</p>
    <p>I certainly gained a new respect for all the legwork people have to do to make mods of this scale, and I hope that my mod brings the same enjoyment as those ones.</p>
    <p>Good Luck!</p>
