The medical community is once again firmly opposed, demanding a full reset of the discussion, while nurses strongly support the expansion as a way to ease their workload. Which side are you on?",

He was the second leader of the Liberty Korea Party (predecessor to the People Power Party) and the founding leader of the United Future Party. Following President Park Geun-hye’s impeachment, he served as Acting President of South Korea for about five months until Moon Jae-in took office. After leaving the People Power Party, he ran as an independent candidate in the 2025 presidential election and founded the Freedom and Innovation Party in July 2025, becoming its leader.<br><br><h3><font style='color: #EC9F19'>2.</font><font style='color: #E0E0E0'> Early Life</h3>Born on April 15, 1957, in Yongsan District, Seoul, he was the youngest of six children. After failing to enter Seoul National University’s law school despite multiple attempts, he enrolled at Sungkyunkwan University as part of the class of ’77. He passed the 23rd bar exam in 1981 and was appointed prosecutor in Cheongju in 1983. Later, he joined the public security division of the Seoul District Prosecutors’ Office, earning the nickname 'Mr. National Security Law'. He served as Chief Prosecutor in Daegu and Busan, published a book titled National Security Law, and retired from prosecution in September 2011 to work as a legal advisor at law firm Taepyeongyang.<br><br>In 2013, he was appointed Minister of Justice under the Park Geun-hye administration. On November 5, 2013, he filed a petition with the Constitutional Court to dissolve the Unified Progressive Party, gaining public attention. After the court approved the dissolution, he was appointed Prime Minister in 2015. During the 2016 South Korean political scandal, he became Acting President following Park’s impeachment. He resigned as Prime Minister on May 10, 2017, when Moon Jae-in was elected president. After stepping down, he voiced political opinions via Facebook and supported Liberty Korea Party candidates in the 2018 local elections.<br><br>On January 15, 2019, he joined the Liberty Korea Party, declaring the country was in 'total crisis' and vowing to correct the Moon administration’s economic failures. He ran for party leader and won with 50.1% of the vote. As a leader, he adopted a more direct and aggressive tone in criticizing Moon Jae-in, contrasting with his previously reserved image. During the Cho Kuk scandal, he shaved his head in protest and staged a hunger strike in front of the Cheong Wa Dae to rally core supporters.<br><br>In 2020, the Liberty Korea Party merged with the New Conservative Party to form the United Future Party, and Hwang became its first leader. Responding to calls to run in a difficult district, he entered the 2020 general election in Jongno, Seoul, against Lee Nak-yon, but suffered a crushing defeat with less than 40% of the vote.<br><br><h3><font style='color: #EC9F19'>3.</font><font style='color: #E0E0E0'> Post-2020 Activities</h3>As vote counts revealed the United Future Party’s defeat, Hwang held a press conference to concede and resigned from all positions. He remained largely out of the spotlight as the party rebranded to the People Power Party, but reentered politics in July 2021 by announcing his presidential bid. During the primary, he promoted election fraud conspiracy theories, including calls for a recount of the 2020 general election, but failed to place in the top four and was eliminated. Afterward, he continued to claim fraud in the People Power Party’s primary and, following his defeat in the 2023 party leadership race, he claimed fraud again and became a leading figure in South Korea’s 2020s election fraud conspiracy movement.<br><br>In 2024, when President Yoon Suk-yeol declared emergency martial law on December 3, Hwang expressed support and called for the arrest of National Assembly Speaker Woo Won-shik and People Power Party leader Han Dong-hoon. He served as a defense attorney for Yoon during his impeachment trial. After the Constitutional Court ruled to remove Yoon from office, Hwang left the People Power Party and ran as an independent in the 2025 presidential election, but withdrew mid-race to endorse Kim Moon-soo. As of late September 2025, he was sentenced to a 1 year and 6 month prison sentence for violating the National Assembly Act, with a first trial verdict scheduled for November 20.<br><br><h3><font style='color: #EC9F19'>4.</font><font style='color: #E0E0E0'> Evaluation</h3>A human who falls has no wings.</p>" }

After college, he served 31 months in the Korean Army as a KATUSA administrative clerk, discharged as a sergeant in 1976. He initially prepared for the bar exam but gave up due to financial hardship and briefly worked at Korea Investment Trust before joining Dong-A Ilbo as a journalist in 1979.<br><br>At Dong-A Ilbo, he worked as a political reporter, Tokyo correspondent, editorial writer, and head of the international desk. During his time as a journalist, he built a relationship with Kim Dae-jung, then leader of the Peace Democratic Party, who encouraged him to enter politics. Although he initially declined, preferring his Tokyo post, he eventually ran in the 2000 general election as a Millennium Democratic Party candidate in Hampyeong-Yeonggwang district and won. He was elected four consecutive times in his hometown of Yeonggwang and served five terms as party spokesperson, earning the nickname 'Five-Term Spokesman'. In 2014, he resigned from the National Assembly and was elected Governor of South Jeolla Province. While serving as governor, he was appointed by President Moon Jae-in as the first Prime Minister of the Moon administration in 2017.<br><br>As Prime Minister, he was praised by Democratic supporters for his eloquence and leadership, and emerged as a leading liberal presidential contender against Hwang Kyo-ahn. He served a record 2 years and 7 months, the longest term for a Prime Minister since democratization, and stepped down in January 2020. Shortly after, he met with Democratic Party leader Lee Hae-chan and ran in the 2020 general election in Jongno District, Seoul, as co-chair of the campaign committee. His active campaigning led to a landslide victory over Hwang Kyo-ahn with nearly 60% of the vote, contributing to the Democratic Party’s sweeping win.<br><br><h3><font style='color: #EC9F19'>3.</font><font style='color: #E0E0E0'> Post-2020 Activities</h3>After the election, he ran for Democratic Party leader and won by a wide margin. Early in his term, he was seen as the likely presidential nominee, but support for hardliner Gyeonggi Governor Lee Jae-myung surged, putting Lee Nak-yon in a difficult position. His 2021 New Year’s proposal to pardon former Presidents Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye sparked backlash within the party and caused his approval ratings to plummet. He eventually resigned as party leader and ran in the Democratic primary with backing from pro-Moon factions, but lost to Lee Jae-myung with only 39% of the vote.<br><br>After his defeat, he left for the United States in June 2022 and spent a year as a visiting scholar at George Washington University. Upon returning, he demanded Lee Jae-myung’s resignation as party leader, and when that failed, he left the Democratic Party in January 2024 and founded the New Future Party, becoming its co-leader. He ran in the 2024 general election in Gwangju Gwangsan B district but suffered a crushing defeat with just 13% of the vote. He did not run in the 2025 presidential election, instead endorsing People Power Party candidate Kim Moon-soo, citing the need to stop Lee Jae-myung’s 'dictatorship'. This drew heavy criticism from Democratic figures, and after Lee Jae-myung won the presidency, Lee Nak-yon’s political future became uncertain. His September 2025 meeting with former President Moon Jae-in and his wife sparked criticism, highlighting his complete estrangement from the Democratic Party.<br><br><h3><font style='color: #EC9F19'>4.</font><font style='color: #E0E0E0'> Evaluation</h3>How harmful is hatred to us?</p>" }

After winning re-election in 2014, he became Governor of Gyeonggi Province in 2018. He ran in the 2022 presidential election but finished second. Following the vacancy left by President Yoon Suk-yeol in 2025, Lee ran again in the 2025 presidential election and won. He is scheduled to serve as president until June 3, 2030.<br><br><h3><font style='color: #EC9F19'>2.</font><font style='color: #E0E0E0'> Early Life</h3>Lee was born around October 1963 in Andong County, North Gyeongsang Province. Due to poverty, his mother never recorded his exact birth date, and even Lee himself does not know it. After finishing elementary school, he moved to Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province, and instead of attending middle school, he worked in a factory as a child laborer. He suffered multiple accidents during this time, resulting in a disability in his left arm and severe depression, even attempting suicide at age 17. Passing the middle school equivalency exam helped him overcome his depression and begin preparing for college. In 1982, he was admitted to Chung-Ang University’s law department with a full tuition waiver. After graduating, he passed the bar exam in 1986 and opened a law office in Seongnam.<br><br>While working as a lawyer and activist, he began to feel the limits of legal advocacy and decided to enter politics in 2004. He ran for mayor of Seongnam in the 2006 local elections but lost, and again lost in the 2008 general election for the Seongnam Bundang A district. In 2010, he ran again for Seongnam mayor and won, then secured re-election in 2014 with a higher vote share. His strong performance as mayor raised his national profile in the mid-2010s, and he began to be seen as a presidential contender.<br><br>After the Park Geun-hye scandal broke in 2016, Lee was among the early voices calling for Park’s resignation, gaining public support. He ran in the 2017 presidential election following Park’s impeachment but placed third in the Democratic Party primary. In 2018, he ran for Governor of Gyeonggi Province and won with 56.4% of the vote, defeating incumbent Nam Kyung-pil of the Liberty Korea Party.

He competed with then-party leader Lee Nak-yon in polls through late 2020, and in 2021, benefited from Lee Nak-yon’s decline to win the party’s nomination. However, in the 2022 presidential election, he lost to People Power Party candidate Yoon Suk-yeol by a margin of 0.73 percentage points. Shortly after, he won a by-election and became a member of the National Assembly, later serving as Democratic Party leader.<br><br>During his tenure as party leader, he was indicted on multiple charges by prosecutors, facing what was dubbed a 'judicial risk'. This led to persistent calls for resignation from within the party, but he held on and led the Democratic Party to victory in the 2024 general election. He also spearheaded the lifting of President Yoon’s martial law declaration and pushed for Yoon’s impeachment, solidifying his status as the leading presidential candidate. After Yoon’s removal from office, Lee ran in the 2025 presidential election and won with 49.42% of the vote, defeating People Power Party candidate Kim Moon-soo.

After a burglary at the family shop when she was three, she was sent to live with her maternal grandparents due to financial hardship. She completed high school in Daegu and entered Hanyang University’s law department, passing the bar exam in 1982. At the time, she was one of only three female passers and drew attention for not being a Seoul National University graduate. She began her judicial career at Chuncheon District Court and later served at Incheon District Court and Gwangju High Court.<br><br>While working at the Gwangju High Court in 1995, she was invited by Kim Dae-jung to enter politics. She resigned from the bench that year and was elected to the National Assembly in 1996. During the 1997 presidential election, she campaigned in her hometown of Daegu to support Kim Dae-jung, naming her campaign team the 'Jeanne d’Arc Squad' to challenge regionalism, and supporters nicknamed her 'Choo d’Arc'. She also helped raise campaign funds for Roh Moo-hyun in 2002, contributing to his victory. However, after clashing with President Roh, she voted in favor of his impeachment in 2004. This led to backlash from liberal voters and her defeat in that year’s general election. She returned to the National Assembly in 2008.<br><br>She served multiple terms as a senior party official and became a five-term lawmaker.

She declared her candidacy for the 2022 presidential race and competed in the Democratic primary against Lee Nak-yon and Lee Jae-myung, finishing third.

In a post-election interview, he revealed he had undergone surgery for oral cancer during the primary. On December 3, 2024, when President Yoon Suk-yeol declared martial law, Park, despite not being a sitting lawmaker, joined citizens at the National Assembly to block military entry. In 2025, he reconciled with Lee Jae-myung and served as Chair of the National Unity Committee in Lee’s presidential campaign. He now appears as a panelist on political talk shows, criticizing the People Power Party and advising the Lee administration.<br><br><h3><font style='color: #EC9F19'>4.</font><font style='color: #E0E0E0'> Evaluation</h3>Works in the shadows and aims for the shadows.</p>" }

Upon returning to Korea, he became a writer and political commentator, publishing works such as 'A Reverse Reading of World History'. He entered politics by founding the Reformist National Party and later joined President Roh Moo-hyun in establishing the Uri Party. He served as a member of the 16th and 17th National Assembly and as the 44th Minister of Health and Welfare. Following Roh’s death in 2009, Ryu was considered a leading presidential candidate for the Democratic Party, but his defeat to Kim Moon-soo in the 2010 Gyeonggi gubernatorial race weakened his political standing. He retired from politics in 2013 and has since focused on writing, publishing multiple bestsellers. He now appears regularly on current affairs programs as a writer and media personality.<br><br><h3><font style='color: #EC9F19'>2.</font><font style='color: #E0E0E0'> Early Life</h3>Ryu was born on July 28, 1959, in Wolseong County, North Gyeongsang Province (now Gyeongju), to a father who was a teacher and a mother who ran a small shop. He spent his school years in Daegu and later entered Seoul National University’s economics department. In 1980, he became chair of the university’s student council and participated in protests at Seoul Station demanding the resignation of Chun Doo-hwan and the military regime. After completing his military service in 1983, he continued student activism as chair of the SNU returning students’ council and a member of the Seoul Labor Movement Union. Due to his activism, he was placed on a wanted list. In 1988, he accepted an offer from then-Peace Democratic Party lawmaker Lee Hae-chan to work as a legislative aide, marking his first political experience. During this time, he privately criticized Kim Dae-jung’s 'mercantile' political style. After graduating from SNU in 1991, he left his aide position in 1992 and studied in Germany, earning a master’s in health economics.<br><br>During his five years abroad, he frequently returned to Korea and built a close relationship with Roh Moo-hyun, sharing economic insights. After returning in 1997, he worked as a political commentator and controversially predicted Kim Dae-jung’s defeat in the presidential election. Even after Kim’s victory, Ryu criticized the Democratic Party’s lack of reform. In the 2002 presidential election, when Roh faced internal opposition, Ryu declared that 'saving Roh Moo-hyun is political reform itself', and transitioned into full-time politics at Roh’s request, founding the Reformist National Party. He was elected in a 2003 by-election in Goyang Deogyang A district, Gyeonggi Province, and joined the newly formed Uri Party, winning re-election in 2004.<br><br>In 2006, President Roh appointed him Minister of Health and Welfare. After stepping down in 2007, Ryu declared his candidacy for president but withdrew during the Grand Unified Democratic New Party’s primary. He ran as an independent in Daegu’s Suseong B district in the 2008 general election but lost. In 2010, he founded the Participation Party and ran for governor of Gyeonggi Province, again losing to Kim Moon-soo. He joined the Unified Progressive Party in 2011 and served as co-leader, but internal factional strife led him to retire from politics in 2013 and focus on writing and commentary. He published bestsellers such as 'How Should We Live', 'My Modern Korean History', 'Ryu Si-min’s Writing Lecture', and 'The History of History'. In 2018, he became chair of the Roh Moo-hyun Foundation and launched the podcast Ryu Si-min’s Alileo in 2019, which gained 500,000 YouTube subscribers within three days.<br><br><h3><font style='color: #EC9F19'>3.</font><font style='color: #E0E0E0'> Post-2020 Activities</h3>Though rumors of a political comeback surfaced during the Moon Jae-in administration, Ryu firmly denied them and did not run in any elections. Just before the 2020 general election, he predicted that the liberal bloc would win 180 seats - a forecast that proved accurate but was criticized for galvanizing conservative voters. Feeling responsible, he suspended political commentary until late 2021. During the 2022 presidential race, he predicted a narrow 1% victory for Democratic candidate Lee Jae-myung, but Yoon Suk-yeol won instead. Ryu appeared as a panelist on KBS’s election coverage and offered words of consolation to Lee. He continues to appear on various broadcasts as a political commentator and is now considered one of the most influential media figures among Democratic supporters.<br><br><h3><font style='color: #EC9F19'>4.</font><font style='color: #E0E0E0'> Evaluation</h3>A politician completed through retirement.</p>" }

    <span style="font-size: 28px;">[Breaking News] Hwang Kyo-ahn Elected...<br>Regime Change in Five Years</span><br>
    <span style="font-size: 20px;">Lee Nak-yon says he 'solemnly accepts' the will of the people</span>
    </h3>
    <p style="text-align: left;">On the night of March 9, 2022, former lawmaker Min Kyung-wook sits in the auditorium of the National Assembly Library, eyes fixed on countless live broadcasts. He had campaigned harder than anyone to fight election fraud, and now, with party officials beside him, he anxiously awaits the release of the exit polls. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. A wave of cheers and applause erupts. Hwang Kyo-ahn has overtaken Lee Nak-yon. A close race? Margin of error? None of that matters. In every past presidential election, the candidate who led in the exit polls ended up winning.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Min Kyung-wook’s expression in the front row is captured clearly by the cameras. He wipes away tears - overwhelmed by the thought that election fraud has finally been defeated and the Moon regime held accountable. As the vote count begins, some colleagues leave with smiles, but Min stays behind. He wants to witness Lee Nak-yon concede and bow in defeat.</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #EDB4C3;"><i><b>One by one, major broadcasters declare Hwang the likely winner.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Indeed, Min Kyung-wook may savor Lee Nak-yon’s defeat just as much as Hwang’s victory. After all, Min was the biggest victim of election fraud in the last general election. Running for re-election in Incheon, he led nearly every poll during the campaign, only to lose by a razor-thin margin to the Democratic Party candidate. Could his controversial remarks and unpopularity really explain the upset? Of course not - it had to be fraud. And who was the Democratic Party’s campaign chief at the time? Lee Nak-yon. Therefore, helping Hwang defeat him was Min’s perfect revenge - and he succeeded.</p><br>

After many rounds of thanks, it’s Min Kyung-wook’s turn. He smiles brighter than ever and clasps Hwang’s hand, sincerely congratulating him. He urges Hwang to declare in his victory speech that the era of election fraud is over. But Hwang’s response is... unexpected.</p>

    </h3>
    <p>The 2027 South Korean presidential election was held on March 3, 2027, to elect the 21st president of South Korea. In the election, Democratic Party lawmaker Lee Kwang-jae defeated former United Future Party leader Won Hee-ryong and former Unification Minister Min Kyung-wook of the Fair Election Party to become president.</p>
    <p>Lee Kwang-jae of the Democratic Party was elected with the highest number of votes in South Korean history, while Won Hee-ryong became the first major presidential candidate from Jeju Island. Voter turnout reached 78.04%, the highest since the 1997 presidential election. Key issues in the race included calls to abolish early voting, the rise of far-right factions, deteriorating Korea-China relations, internal divisions within the conservative bloc, low birth rates and aging demographics, and the decline of non-metropolitan regions.</p>
    <p>Lee Kwang-jae became the first Democratic Party candidate to win an outright majority and pledged to 'faithfully carry out the people’s mandate for generational change and national unity', adding that he would 'fully dispel the lingering election fraud conspiracy theories still present in some corners of society'. Won Hee-ryong of the United Future Party accepted the results, stating, 'I sincerely thank the people who supported me and offer my apologies.' However, some argued that his defeat was inevitable due to Min Kyung-wook’s independent candidacy. In response, Min countered, 'The Hwang Kyo-ahn administration’s efforts to eliminate election fraud were woefully insufficient', and added, 'This election clearly proves what happens when the sacrifices of the conservative right are ignored and betrayed.'</p>`)

    <span style="font-size: 20px;">Will the Moon era continue for another five years?</span>
    </h3>
    <p style="text-align: left;">There are two types of elections: ones you can afford to lose, and ones you absolutely must win. Losing the former doesn’t inflict serious political damage. If the candidate puts up a decent fight, they’re often praised and may even gain future opportunities, like when a Democratic candidate runs in the Gyeongsang region. But losing a must-win election? That’s the end. Not just for the candidate, but for everyone who staked their future on that campaign. And here we have the candidate who lost the election he had to win, and the man who had pinned all his hopes on him.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Former Gyeonggi Governor Kim Moon-soo felt his heart drop the moment he saw the exit polls. Once considered a presidential hopeful, he suffered repeated defeats and tried to revive his career by aligning with Christian conservatives and election fraud conspiracies. His comeback hinged on Hwang Kyo-ahn winning, with a platform centered on rooting out fraudulent elections. But reality didn’t go his way. Lee Nak-yon was leading. TV screens showed cheering Democrats and a silent United Future Party. A reporter’s comment that early voting may not fully reflect in the exit polls, meaning Lee might win by an even larger margin, felt like salt in the wound.</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #FFF2B2;"><i><b>One by one, major broadcasters declare Lee the likely winner.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Kim’s mind raced. Hwang would probably reject the results, either aggressively or passively. Conservatives might sympathize, but having lost two major elections under his leadership, Hwang’s political career would be over. The next presidential election would come when Lee’s administration hits rock bottom, and a hardline conservative like Hwang could defeat the Democrats. And if the UFP regains power, Hwang might be honored as a conservative elder.</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #FFE566;"><i><b>Projections gradually shift from 'likely' to 'confirmed'.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">But what about Kim Moon-soo? He’s already over 70. His only remaining path was a high-ranking post under a Hwang administration. No matter how much he prays, the vote count keeps pushing Hwang’s chances closer to zero. Kim sees no future. At best, he’ll scrape by as a right-wing YouTuber, never again dreaming of prestigious roles like presidential candidate. This is not the life Kim wanted. Not at all. He can’t bear to watch Lee’s victory speech and turns off the TV.</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #FFD918;"><i><b>And then, Lee crosses the final threshold of votes needed, and his victory is officially confirmed.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Kim Moon-soo is left in endless regret, not even knowing what exactly he regrets.</p>`)

    <p>The 2027 South Korean presidential election was held on March 3, 2027, to elect the 21st president of South Korea. In the election, Kim Jin-tae of the United Future Party, former Governor of Gangwon State, defeated Yang Seung-jo of the Democratic Party, former Prime Minister, to become president.</p>
    <p>Kim Jin-tae won with a vote share close to a majority, marking the first conservative victory and power shift in a decade. Yang Seung-jo was the first major party presidential candidate born in South Chungcheong Province since the introduction of direct elections in 1987, and the second Democratic Prime Minister to run for president after Lee Nak-yon. Voter turnout was 73.70%, a slight drop from the previous election. Key issues in the race included constitutional reform, the introduction of a four-day workweek, controversy surrounding Kim Jin-tae’s handling of the Legoland bankruptcy, inter-Korean relations, low birth rates and aging demographics, and the decline of non-metropolitan regions.</p>
    <p>Kim Jin-tae stated that 'the result reflects the people’s desire to end the ten years of regression under Moon and Lee', and pledged to achieve balanced regional development based on his administrative experience in Gangwon. However, within the United Future Party, some raised concerns that despite the low approval ratings of the Lee administration, the close race happened due to Kim’s past extreme remarks and missteps that triggered financial market instability. Yang Seung-jo of the Democratic Party said, 'I wanted to be a public servant who could show a more advanced version of the ruling party, but the people have chosen a firm judgment,' and added, 'I am deeply sorry to the citizens and to my fellow party members.'</p>`)

    </h3>
    <p style="text-align: left;">After winning the primary, Lee Jae-myung began assembling his campaign team and tried to appease former Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon, whose relationship with him had soured during the race, by offering him the position of chief campaign advisor. Of course, giving him a title didn’t erase the resentment. Lee Nak-yon couldn’t accept the reality that he now had to publicly support Lee Jae-myung’s candidacy. He had proven his administrative ability as Prime Minister under Moon Jae-in, led the party to victory in the general election, and rode that momentum to become the Democratic Party leader. Until 2020, everyone assumed Lee Nak-yon would be the next president. And yet, some mere provincial governor had snatched the nomination that was practically his. Now, Lee Nak-yon felt more disgust than kinship toward Lee Jae-myung. As Democratic Party leaders and lawmakers gathered to watch the exit polls, he was likely the only one harboring a different hope.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">When the exit polls were released, Lee Nak-yon thought: <i>This can’t be happening.</i> The numbers showed Hwang Kyo-ahn ahead of Lee Jae-myung, but the margin was narrower than expected - Lee had performed better than the polls predicted. Next to him, Democratic Party leader Song Young-gil clapped and cried, shouting Lee’s name, convinced they might actually win. Lee Nak-yon forced a few claps, but behind his mask, he bit his lip. He could only hope that the decades-long streak of accurate exit poll predictions would hold true once again.</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #EDB4C3;"><i><b>One by one, major broadcasters declare Hwang the likely winner.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">The early vote count, especially from the early voting ballots, was nerve-wracking. With only about 10% of the votes counted, Lee Jae-myung was actually ahead, overturning the exit polls. Lee Nak-yon briefly questioned the reliability of the conservative media he usually trusted, wondering if he had become out of touch with public sentiment. Fortunately, that doubt didn’t last long. As conservative votes from Seoul and Gyeongsang Province poured in, Hwang overtook Lee midway through the count - and never lost the lead again.</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #ED7B99;"><i><b>Projections gradually shift from 'likely' to 'confirmed'.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">At dawn, Lee Jae-myung held a press conference at the Democratic Party headquarters and conceded defeat. He took full responsibility and congratulated Hwang Kyo-ahn, his eyes swollen, perhaps from crying at home. Song Young-gil watched the concession speech and shed tears of a different kind. Some supporters sobbed openly, while others urged Lee to run again next time. But let’s be clear, that won’t happen. Lee Jae-myung will now face trial over the Daejang-dong scandal, draining whatever political capital he has left. And the one who relentlessly raised that issue during the primaries? None other than Lee Nak-yon. Grateful to his past self for buying that insurance, he smiled quietly amid the crowd of losers.</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #EF426F;"><i><b>And then, Hwang crosses the final threshold of votes needed, and his victory is officially confirmed.</b></i></p><br>

    <p>The 2027 South Korean presidential election was held on March 3, 2027, to elect the 21st president of South Korea. In the election, Kim Tae-heum, former governor of South Chungcheong Province and candidate of the United Future Party, defeated Jung Chung-rae, former emergency committee chair of the Democratic Party, to become president.</p>
    <p>Kim Tae-heum became the first president from the Chungcheong region since Yun Po-sun. Jung Chung-rae became the first candidate from a major party to run after the original nominee, confirmed through the primary, was disqualified from candidacy. Lee Nak-yon of the New Future Democratic Party withdrew mid-race and endorsed Kim Tae-heum. Key issues in the race included the special investigation law on election fraud, the Democratic Party’s internal split, the Supreme Court’s guilty verdict against former candidate Lee Jae-myung, political polarization, low birth rates and aging demographics, and the decline of non-metropolitan regions.</p>
    <p>After his victory was confirmed, Kim Tae-heum stated in his speech: 'Without the support of former Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon and the people, this win would not have been possible.' He pledged to 'work with the National Assembly to swiftly draft a constitutional amendment for the people and open a new era,' and added, 'We will no longer be held back by suspicions of election fraud, we will move forward.' Meanwhile, some supporters of the defeated Democratic Party candidate Jung Chung-rae raised doubts about the fairness of the election, claiming without evidence that President Hwang may have intervened in Lee Nak-yon’s candidacy withdrawal and the unification with Kim Tae-heum. US President JD Vance spoke with President-elect Kim Tae-heum, congratulating him on South Korea’s free and fair election, and expressed hope that the strengthened Korea-United States alliance under President Hwang’s administration would continue to grow.</p>`)

    <p style="text-align: left;">In the outskirts of Gyeonggi Province, there was a high school where students lived in dormitories for three years, fiercely preparing for college entrance exams. The boy in this story was one of those students, but unlike his peers, he had little interest in studying. He had gotten into the school by sheer luck, and his passion for academics was lukewarm at best. Instead, he was deeply obsessed with something else: politics. While others hit the study hall after class, he secretly drew presidential election prediction charts. He even analyzed each candidate’s chances and presented his findings to friends.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">So what did the boy predict? A narrow lead for Hwang Kyo-ahn. He gave Hwang a 65% chance of winning. Personally, he hoped Lee Jae-myung would win, but didn’t expect much. When the exit polls were released, the boy was still in the study hall and couldn’t check the results right away. Only during break did he step outside and casually search for the numbers. And had no one been around, he would’ve shouted with joy - JTBC’s exit poll showed Lee Jae-myung in the lead. He happily wrapped up his study session and headed to the dorm to watch the vote count with his friends. Before the winner was confirmed, it was lights-out. He went to bed hoping the exit polls would prove accurate.</p><br>

    <p style="text-align: left;">As wake-up music played through the speakers, the boy rushed to the phone locker. A friend had already checked the results, so he asked what happened. The friend sighed and replied, Lee Jae-myung won, the country’s doomed, blah blah blah. Most of the boy’s classmates viewed Lee as a corrupt criminal with no grasp of economics and a broken personality. Even the boy, who considered himself progressive, had absorbed some of that sentiment and wasn’t particularly warm toward Lee. He had supported Lee, but only as a lesser evil to prevent Hwang’s victory.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">But the moment he heard Lee had won, all his unease melted away. The thrill of hearing 'Lee Jae-myung won' was electric. Not the demonized Lee crafted by the right-wing YouTubers and the United Future Party - but the real President Lee. That moment made the boy realize his feelings weren’t just reluctant support. When he saw the exit polls, he thought he was happy about Hwang’s defeat. But now he knew that was self-denial. O cruel, needless misunderstanding! But it was all right, everything was all right, the struggle was finished. He had won the victory over smear campaigns.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">He loved Lee Jae-myung.</p>`)

    <p>With her victory, Yun Hee-suk became the second female president in South Korean history and the first president born in the 1970s. At age 70 during the election, Kim Dong-yeon was the first Democratic Party candidate to be older than the previous nominee from the party. Justice Party candidate Lee Jung-mi withdrew mid-race after successfully negotiating a 'multi-party political reform' unification with Kim Dong-yeon. Key issues in the race included a rural basic income program, high inflation and rising prices, a slump in the real estate market, political polarization, low birth rates and aging demographics, and the decline of non-metropolitan regions.</p>
    <p>Yun Hee-suk, a politician with a background in economics and a graduate of Seoul National University, stated, 'I believe I’ve come this far because the public recognized my sincere commitment to solving our economic challenges. I will work to stabilize livelihoods and normalize the real estate market as quickly as possible.' Kim Dong-yeon commented, 'I had hoped to spark a cheerful rebellion, but unfortunately, I failed to meet expectations. I hope President-elect Yun will focus on revitalizing Korea’s market economy rather than wasting energy on political strife.' Also, both candidates opposed the nationwide expansion of the rural basic income program that had been promoted by President Lee Jae-myung during the campaign.</p>`)

    </h3>
    <p style="text-align: left;">As the exit polls were released, Han Dong-hoon, Deputy Director of the Judicial Training Institute, like many prosecutors, let out a deep breath. The race had been neck-and-neck throughout, but in the end, Hwang Kyo-ahn’s victory seemed to delay the downfall of the prosecution by another five years. Just as Han was preparing to go for a walk, his phone rang. He frowned at the caller’s name and, as usual, ignored it and shoved the phone into his pocket. The caller was none other than Yoon Suk-yeol, his former boss and once closest senior, although they hadn’t spoken in a long time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">In fact, Han had stopped answering Yoon’s calls about a year ago - around the time Yoon’s disastrous audio recordings leaked and he resigned as Prosecutor General. Watching Yoon repeat the same lines on YouTube made Han wonder if something had gone seriously wrong with Yoon. Han had always dismissed election fraud claims as nonsense, and after that incident, his view of Yoon flipped completely. A madman who helped elevate Choo Mi-ae to presidential candidacy. A fool who dragged the entire prosecution into crisis. An anti-intellectual conspiracy theorist. The man responsible for Han’s demotion from chief prosecutor to a backwater post at the Judicial Training Institute. And yet, ironically, Han had voted for Hwang Kyo-ahn, the very conspiracy theorist, just to stop Choo Mi-ae from dismantling the prosecution.</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #EDB4C3;"><i><b>One by one, major broadcasters declare Hwang the likely winner.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Han walked through the park near his home, contemplating his future. Hwang had spent 30 years as a prosecutor himself, so Han figured his own path to redemption might reopen. His history as Yoon’s close aide had earned him intense scrutiny under the Moon administration, which ironically boosted his public profile. Maybe he’d land a key position at the Ministry of Justice. If lucky, he could even become Minister of Justice. Or perhaps, he could take over the very job once held by that regrettable man and become the next Prosecutor General-</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">His phone rang again.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">This time, it was a voicemail notification. Once again, the sender was Yoon Suk-yeol. Han hesitated for a long moment, then decided to listen.</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #ED7B99;"><i><b>Projections gradually shift from 'likely' to 'confirmed'.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">'Well, hey, Dong-hoon. My wife wants me to cook a proper meal tonight, so I’ll keep this short.'</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">'Looks like Hwang Kyo-ahn’s going to win after all, huh? I know I’m the last person who should say this, but isn’t that a good thing? We can finally wipe out those commie election fraudsters, and maybe you’ll get back to where you were.'</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">'I really do feel sorry, I mean really, for what happened. If I’d known things would spiral like this and drag you down too, I would’ve been more careful. I understand if you’re still angry. But whatever you think of me, I was speaking from conviction, and I never once believed telling the truth was wrong, so please understand that.'</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">'Anyway, well, I’ve been thinking… maybe you should try politics, Dong-hoon. I’m finished, but with the new administration, you might get a shot. I’ll hang up now. Umm... If you’re up for it, give me a call. Let’s grab a meal sometime.'</p><br>

    </h3>
    <p>The 2027 South Korean presidential election was held on March 3, 2027, to elect the 21st president of South Korea. In the election, Park Beom-kye, former Minister of Justice and candidate of the Democratic Party, defeated Han Dong-hoon, former lawmaker of the United Future Party, and Kim Moon-soo, former Governor of Gyeonggi Province running as an independent, to become president.</p>
    <p>Park Beom-kye won by a margin just under 10 percentage points, becoming the first president in South Korean history to hail from North Chungcheong Province. Han Dong-hoon ran on a platform that sharply criticized the Hwang Kyo-ahn administration’s stance on alleged election fraud but was ultimately defeated. Key issues in the race included prosecutorial reform, conspiracy theories surrounding fraud in the 2024 general election, internal divisions among conservatives between pro-Hwang and anti-Hwang factions, political polarization, low birth rates and aging demographics, and the decline of non-metropolitan regions.</p>
    <p>Park Beom-kye stated, 'Upon taking office, I will immediately implement reform measures to end the era of the prosecution republic,' adding, 'We will ensure that prosecutors never again wield unchecked control over state power.' Han Dong-hoon commented, 'Despite widespread opposition, I came this far by cutting ties with conspiracy theorists but accepted the disappointing result. I apologize to the fellow citizens who supported me in good faith.' Independent candidate Kim Moon-soo, who was rumored to consider unifying with Han during the campaign but ultimately ran to the end, claimed the election result was 'definitive proof' that even five years after the Hwang administration, election fraud remains unresolved.</p>`)

    <span style="font-size: 20px;">Shattering the glass ceiling… all the way to the Cheong Wa Dae</span>
    </h3>
    <p style="text-align: left;">On the night of March 9, 2022, an elderly woman staying in a VIP room at Samsung Seoul Hospital felt the deepest frustration she’d experienced in years. When she voted, she initially wore her usual navy coat, but fearing it might be misinterpreted, she even went out of her way to wear red and cast her vote for Hwang Kyo-ahn. Was it out of loyalty from their time working together as president and prime minister? Not at all. Hwang had completely abandoned her when she was imprisoned, focused only on saving himself. Was it to stop the dismantling of the prosecution? Again, no. Having been pardoned for all her charges, she no longer cared about the fate of prosecutors. The real reason was simple: to prevent Choo Mi-ae from stealing her symbolic title - South Korea’s first female president.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Throughout the campaign, Park was haunted by the fear that Choo might erase her legacy from Korean political history. Choo rejected the ambiguous label of 'second' female president, instead claiming she would be the first progressive woman to hold the office. At times, she even criticized Park for lacking feminine leadership, suggesting that if elected, she would be the true first female president. And now, with exit polls showing Choo in the lead, such rhetoric is poised to dominate the national narrative. Park, facing discharge from the hospital, wonders how she’ll live from here on. The future feels especially bleak tonight.</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #FFF2B2;"><i><b>One by one, major broadcasters declare Choo the likely winner.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Her worries extend beyond the personal. What will become of the conservative bloc starting tomorrow? Everything had been forcibly centered around Hwang Kyo-ahn, only to collapse all at once. It may take a long time to recover, and in the worst-case scenario, the Democratic Party could enjoy a 15-year reign. For a moment, Park even wonders if she might go down as the last conservative president. What must be done? Who is needed to save conservatism?</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #FFE566;"><i><b>Projections gradually shift from 'likely' to 'confirmed'.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Just then, a scenario flashes through Park’s mind. She recalls her longtime legal defender, Yoo Young-ha, once expressing interest in running for mayor of Daegu in the next local election. With her backing, his nomination would be a breeze. Yoo, having remained loyal to Park for five years despite her downfall, would likely serve as her public voice if elected. That way, Park wouldn’t be just a retired elder in exile - she’d regain influence in the United Future Party as a former president. She resolves to record a video endorsing Yoo Young-ha as soon as she returns home. But...</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #FFD918;"><i><b>And then, Choo crosses the final threshold of votes needed, and her victory is officially confirmed.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Park forgot one crucial truth: in this country, shadow politics has never succeeded.</p>`)

    <p>The 2027 South Korean presidential election was held on March 3, 2027, to elect the 21st president of South Korea. In the election, Democratic Party lawmaker Kim Han-kyu defeated former Daegu Mayor Yoo Young-ha of the United Future Party to become president.</p>
    <p>With Kim Han-kyu’s victory, the Democratic Party became the first party since democratization to win three consecutive presidential elections without changing its name. It also marked the first time in 56 years - since Park Chung-hee in 1971 - that a single political faction secured three consecutive terms through direct elections. Kim Han-kyu is the first president born in the 1970s and the first to claim Jeju Province as his political base. Yoo Young-ha was the first politician from Daegu to run for president. Key issues in the race included the dismantling of the Prosecutors’ Office, debates over the national land ownership tax, gender conflicts, political polarization, low birth rates and aging demographics, and the decline of non-metropolitan regions.</p>
    <p>Kim Han-kyu stated, 'Now that prosecutorial reform has been completed, it’s time to look toward the future. I will pursue a wide range of policies, regardless of ideology, to strengthen Korea’s AI competitiveness and foster new engines of growth.' Yoo Young-ha commented, 'Due to my shortcomings, I failed to rescue conservatism from crisis. The fault is entirely mine.

    <span style="font-size: 20px;">Cho Kuk in Shock, Legal Risks Await</span>
    </h3>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Cho Kuk gave it his all. He even resorted to unconventional tactics like Instagram Live to rally young voters and traditional supporters. His campaign efforts were nearly twice as intense as Hwang Kyo-ahn’s, visiting up to ten cities in a single day toward the end. While Cho acknowledged his disadvantage, he also held onto hope that he could overturn his negative public image. Just before the polling blackout period, polls showed a clear upward trend in his support, fueling dreams of a dramatic comeback, like Truman’s historic upset. After wrapping up his campaign, Cho sat alone in his empty home, imagining: 'The Flower Research must be right, maybe I’ll win by a 1-point margin, I’ll meet President Moon Jae-in as the president-elect next week…' Then he saw the exit polls and realized.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 'Well, I’m over.'</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #EDB4C3;"><i><b>One by one, major broadcasters declare Hwang the likely winner.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">After his defeat, Cho never got a second chance. Trials that had been paused for the election resumed immediately. Within the Democratic Party, criticism erupted, calling his candidacy reckless from the start. With public opinion turning against him, he couldn’t run for party leader or in any by-election. He simply endured a grueling court schedule, gradually fading from public memory. Eventually, multiple charges led to convictions: First trial in July 2023, 2 years in prison. Appeal in July 2024, sentence upheld. Final ruling in May 2025, sentence confirmed, and a five-year ban on running for office after release. Cho Kuk staked everything on a single election - and lost. He will be remembered as a politician who vanished after one failed bid.</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #ED7B99;"><i><b>Projections gradually shift from 'likely' to 'confirmed'.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">But... what if Cho hadn’t run? Any alternative would likely have led to a better future and a more lasting legacy in Korean politics. If the Democratic Party had retained power, sympathy from the liberal base might have led to a special pardon for him. If Hwang had defeated a different Democratic candidate, Cho could have returned in the 2024 general election, campaigning on holding the new administration accountable and staying in the public eye. He might even have founded his own opposition party and <i>rebuilt Korea</i>. It was simply a premature move that led to a far-from-optimal outcome. Does it feel unfair? Perhaps. But it is what it is.</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #EF426F;"><i><b>And then, Hwang crosses the final threshold of votes needed, and his victory is officially confirmed.</b></i></p><br>

    <p>Kim Kyoung-soo, who had been granted a special pardon in 2022, ran for president without holding any further public office and won. He became the third Democratic president from South Gyeongsang Province, following Roh Moo-hyun and Moon Jae-in. Chung Jin-suk was the first major candidate from the Chungcheong region in 30 years, since Lee In-je. Voter turnout reached 80.83%, the highest since 1992. Key issues in the race included the treatment of former Justice Minister Cho Kuk, political polarization, improving Korea-Japan relations, reforming the college admissions system, low birth rates and aging demographics, and the decline of non-metropolitan regions.</p>
    <p>Kim Kyoung-soo stated, 'I will follow the public’s will not to govern autocratically and keep my promises to the people,' adding, 'I will not push for the restoration of Cho Kuk’s eligibility to run for office during my term.' Chung Jin-suk said, 'It’s deeply disappointing, but I accept the result. I hope both parties will cooperate and restore an old political culture that helps the country progress.' After the election, some United Future Party supporters raised suspicions of election fraud due to the close vote count. Chung dismissed the claims, saying, 'Can’t we just stop this whole thing now?'</p>`)

    </h3>
    <p style="text-align: left;">When Kim Ou-joon first announced he was launching a polling agency, the political establishment rushed to ridicule him, accusing the partisan broadcaster of now trying to manipulate public opinion. Well, it wasn’t an entirely unreasonable criticism. Kim Ou-joon openly supported Cho Kuk, and among dozens of polling firms, only his 'Flower Research' showed Cho consistently leading. People assumed the results were skewed by the founder’s bias. But had they known that Flower Research was the only firm spending tens of millions of won weekly to conduct both phone interviews and automated response surveys, would they have judged differently? Did they even realize Kim Ou-joon used statistically recommended methods, like virtual mobile numbers instead of easily faked RDD calls? Most people weren’t deep enough into politics to analyze polling methodology, so they trusted the cheap, mass-produced surveys that showed Hwang Kyo-ahn ahead.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">With the focus not on who would win, but by how much Hwang would win, the exit polls dropped like a thunderbolt: Cho Kuk was leading. They... panicked. There’s no other word for it. The United Future Party’s vote-counting room, once cheerful, froze over instantly. The Democratic Party’s room, meanwhile, erupted. Commentators on election broadcasts tried to explain the result by pointing to a last-minute surge in Cho’s support base, but it was clear that wasn’t enough to account for the outcome. They couldn’t lean on far-right conspiracy theories about election fraud either. In the end, they had to admit it - the polls had been wrong. Kim Ou-joon had been right.</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #FFF2B2;"><i><b>One by one, major broadcasters declare Cho the likely winner.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">The shock among conservative voters was so palpable that the next day, the front page of the Chosun Ilbo was printed blank. Some polling firms issued apologies for misleading the public with inaccurate data. Hwang Kyo-ahn again claimed election fraud was highly likely, but the polling errors didn’t fuel new conspiracy theories. Thankfully, the situation could be explained by parallels to the 2016 US election. And since Hwang had lost to Cho Kuk, a candidate widely seen as weak, his political stature took a major hit.</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #FFE566;"><i><b>Projections gradually shift from 'likely' to 'confirmed'.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Naturally, attention shifted to Kim Ou-joon. Even conservative media and progressive outlets that had previously dismissed him began reassessing the accuracy of Flower Research. When Kim went live on YouTube with fellow journalists, viewership spiked tenfold. Questions poured in: How did he get it so right? How much did it cost? And most of all, how did he confidently present such outlier results on air? In response, Kim Ou-joon shouted the phrase he always used to describe Flower Research.</p><br>

    <p>Kim Gi-hyeon became the first president from Ulsan. Choi Kang-wook was the first presidential candidate from a Democratic-affiliated party to have previously served as Prime Minister.

Key issues in the race included conspiracy theories surrounding alleged election fraud in the 2020s, political polarization, the solidarity wage system, expansion of progressives’ influence, low birth rates and aging demographics, and the decline of non-metropolitan regions.</p>
    <p>Kim Gi-hyeon stated, 'The public has made it clear - they won’t tolerate five more years of Cho Kuk’s hypocritical politics. In a way, this result was inevitable,' and pledged to 'urgently clean up the damage caused by the Cho Kuk regime, including shortsighted economic policies and judicial misconduct.' Choi Kang-wook acknowledged his defeat after Kim’s win was confirmed, but expressed some concern as well: 'After immense struggle, the Democratic Party and the people have nearly dismantled the prosecution cartel. I hope President-elect Kim Gi-hyeon does not take the country backward.' The Justice Party held a leadership meeting the day after the election and assessed the results as highly positive.

    <p style="text-align: left;">As soon as the election ended, Democrats began pointing fingers. They scorned President Moon Jae-in for tanking the party’s approval ratings with his failed housing policies, blamed the party leadership for being uncooperative and incompetent during the campaign, and cursed the primary losers who ignored Yoon Suk-yeol’s calls for unity. But the top target of their rage was Sim Sang-jung. A politician who claimed to fight for a welfare state but, through her actions, helped Hwang Kyo-ahn win. She ignored Yoon’s repeated proposals for a unified candidacy and insisted on running to the end, effectively handing the presidency to the United Future Party. To many Democrats, she was no longer a progressive ally but a traitor aligned with conservatives. Once considered a partner, Sim was now seen as someone who must be ousted in the next general election.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Still, Sim wasn’t blindsided by this backlash. She had long dismissed the idea of unifying with either major party, believing they were essentially the same. She knew her candidacy might split the progressive vote and pave the way for Hwang’s victory, and she accepted that risk. She wasn’t worried about deteriorating relations with the Democratic Party, believing her party could survive independently. What truly shocked her was something else: even in a race between two extreme conspiracy theorists, most voters still chose one of them. Her goal of securing 12% of the vote now felt impossibly out of reach. She couldn’t blame the voters, but she was struck by how entrenched the two-party system had become.</p><br>

Normally, even before the National Election Commission officially announces the winner, losing candidates deliver their concession. Yet Yoon Suk-yeol was nowhere to be seen - not even after the outcome was clear. It wasn’t until the next morning that Yoon appeared and held a press conference. Sim, still awake and waiting just in case, watched it live.</p><br>

    <p>Yoon Sang-hyun stated, 'I sincerely thank the people for choosing to decisively purge the forces that refused to accept the presidential election results,' and pledged, 'I will carry forward President Hwang Kyo-ahn’s mission to eradicate election fraud and swiftly eliminate pro-North leftists and conspiracy theorists.' Hwang Un-ha said in his post-election speech, 'I will never forget the support of those who believed in me and the Democratic Party.' Bae Jin-kyo declared, 'The Democratic Party, which failed to sever ties with conspiracy theorist Yoon Suk-yeol, has already lost its function as a normal political party.

    <p style="text-align: left;">When a photo of President Moon Jae-in casting his early vote was released by the media, a small wave of gossip rippled through the public. Who did Moon vote for in this election? It obviously wasn’t Hwang Kyo-ahn, but it also seemed unlikely that Moon would vote for Yoon Suk-yeol, who had kept a careful distance from him, just because they belonged to the same party. Maybe Moon clenched his teeth and voted for Yoon, trusting he wouldn’t seek political revenge at least? Or perhaps, given that his daughter was a Justice Party member, he boldly voted for Sim Sang-jung? Or maybe he was so fed up with all the candidates that he just threw in the towel and voted for Huh Kyung-young? Half-joking, half-serious debates swirled online, but none offered a clear answer.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Unfortunately, everyone guessed wrong. Moon’s vote went to a minor candidate, Kim Dong-yeon. He hadn’t decided who to vote for until he stepped into the polling station, even considering submitting a spoiled ballot. But when he saw Kim Dong-yeon’s name tucked far down the list, he felt a pang. Kim had served under Moon as Deputy Prime Minister for the Economy, and now he was running a lonely, overlooked campaign. Out of sympathy and support for Kim’s future in politics, Moon stamped his name and left the booth, hoping Kim would at least finish with dignity. For the record, Kim Dong-yeon ended up with about 110,000 votes - roughly 0.3%. Reality is cruel, as always.</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #FFF2B2;"><i><b>One by one, major broadcasters declare Yoon the likely winner.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Despite his disillusionment with politics, Moon stayed up all night at the Cheong Wa Dae watching the vote count - he still had to hand over power to his successor. The results didn’t stray far from his expectations. If voters had to choose between a left-wing conspiracy theorist and a right-wing conspiracy theorist, the outsider was more likely to win. Yoon also leveraged his father’s roots in South Chungcheong Province to gain strong regional support. That’s how he won. Once victory seemed certain, Yoon rushed to the Democratic Party headquarters and threw an uppercut into the air, declaring his triumph.</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #FFE566;"><i><b>Projections gradually shift from 'likely' to 'confirmed'.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">And so, Moon Jae-in, at least nominally, became a president who successfully extended his party’s rule. Progressive welfare policies would likely continue for another five years, and since Yoon was elected as a Democrat, Moon’s legacy wouldn’t be erased completely. Still, it was hard to expect Yoon to show deep respect for him. But that’s okay. Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye had a similar dynamic. It’s not unusual. Moon tells himself he’s happy. He leaves behind a divided nation and a thousand conspiracy theories, but he’s happy. In two months, a political rookie with zero governing experience will take office, but he’s happy. He helped create a reality that’s light-years away from the society citizens dreamed of after Park’s impeachment, but he’s happy.</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #FFD918;"><i><b>And then, Hwang crosses the final threshold of votes needed, and his victory is officially confirmed.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">This is what a real country looks like, and this is a world where people come first.</p>`)

    </h3>
    <p>The 2025 South Korean presidential election was held on June 3, 2025, to elect the 21st president of South Korea. In the election, Rep. Bae Hyun-jin of the United Future Party defeated former Prime Minister Kim Han-gil of the Democratic Party to win the presidency. Originally scheduled for March 3, 2027, following the end of President Yoon Suk-yeol’s term, the election was held early due to Yoon’s impeachment and removal from office.</p>
    <p>Bae Hyun-jin became the first journalist-turned-president in South Korean history, and at age 41, the youngest president ever elected. Kim Han-gil, who had served on Yoon Suk-yeol’s campaign team during the 2022 presidential election, was the first Democratic-affiliated candidate born in Japan. Key issues in the race included the 2024 South Korean martial law crisis, conspiracy theories surrounding alleged fraud in the 2024 general election, the stabbing incident involving candidate Bae Hyun-jin, allegations of media suppression under the Yoon administration, low birth rates and aging demographics, and the decline of non-metropolitan regions.</p>
    <p>Bae Hyun-jin stated, 'I deeply honor the people’s choice to overcome the threat of leftist dictatorship and support a decisive judgment on rebellion', and she added, 'What our country urgently needs now is unity. I will walk the path of restoring liberal democracy and normalizing Korea together with all citizens.' Kim Han-gil, acknowledging his defeat, said: 'After decades of working within the Democratic Party, I always tried to meet the expectations of the people - but clearly, I failed.' He continued, 'Regarding both the outcome of this election and the martial law crisis last winter, all I can offer is my sincere apology.'</p>`)

    <span style="font-size: 20px;">'A valiant loss'? Party mood says, 'Not really'</span>
    </h3>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Two weeks after the presidential election, JoongAng Ilbo sat down with one of the most talked-about figures in the Democratic Party: Rep. Park Yong-jin (two-term lawmaker, Gangbuk B district, Seoul), former presidential candidate and known within the party as a principled voice. Meeting at the National Assembly office building, Park greeted reporters with a bright smile, showing no trace of gloom. He denied rumors of a run in the upcoming local elections, but candidly reflected on the presidential campaign, saying, 'Our Democratic Party can still be a winning party - and must be.' Here’s the Q&A.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Q.</b> How have you been?</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><b>A.</b> Not great. (laughs) Thanks to calls and messages from constituents and party members, I’ve been getting through it. Before, I mostly got texts telling me to shut up, so this is indeed a strange change. (laughs)</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Q.</b> What was the biggest regret during the campaign?</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><b>A.</b> The candidate switch came way too late. We had no time to regroup, and the election just ended as it was. Candidate change was inevitable, so the party should’ve wrapped things up quickly and picked a new candidate by mid-December. The fear that stepping back would make things worse didn’t help at all. So I’d say it wasn’t just my regret, it was the party’s.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Q.</b> That sounds like criticism of former candidate Yoon Suk-yeol and the party leadership.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><b>A.</b> I won’t deny it. If we let this slide without holding anyone accountable, that’s a bigger problem. After I was nominated, the party approached the election with a defeatist attitude - that was an issue, too. Of course, I take responsibility as well. I have no plans to run in the local elections or take on any new roles. I’ll return to my duties as a lawmaker and focus on legislative work.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Q.</b> What direction should the Democratic Party take going forward?</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><b>A.</b> We need to reflect on the mistakes made during the Moon administration. If a policy is needed by the people, we should adopt it regardless of ideology. That’s how we win over centrist and conservative voters and become a winning party again------</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><b>'Stop.'</b></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #EDB4C3;"><i><b>One by one, major broadcasters declare Hwang the likely winner.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">'Curious about what he said, I read the interview, and yep, still saying things that don’t help at all.'</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">A staffer at the Cheong Wa Dae spat out her gum onto the newspaper, folded it, and tossed it into the trash. She never liked Park Yong-jin much, and reading the interview made her feel her patience evaporate in real time. Do you know what Gallup Korea’s latest poll showed? Democratic Party: <b>23%.</b> While the United Future Party got 40%. After the election, Democratic supporters lost all motivation, and the party is on the brink of collapse. And instead of seeking unity, Park is still saying things that conservative media love to hear, and this is coming from someone who was a presidential candidate just weeks ago.</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #ED7B99;"><i><b>Projections gradually shift from 'likely' to 'confirmed'.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">The public may not realize it yet, but the Democratic Party is already in survival mode. Rumors swirl about Park Yong-jin running for party leader, but aside from a few junior lawmakers, he has little support, and the presidential campaign left no unifying figure in the party. Even Lee Nak-yon is reportedly considering leading the remaining pro-Moon faction to form a 'New Pro-Moon Party'. President Moon Jae-in, watching all this unfold, has already drafted a farewell post for Facebook. He says he’ll never be involved in politics again. He just wants to be forgotten.</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #EF426F;"><i><b>And then, Hwang crosses the final threshold of votes needed, and his victory is officially confirmed.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Abandoning an election? Yeah, probably not the best idea.</p>`)

    <p>The 2027 South Korean presidential election was held on March 3, 2027, to elect the 21st president of South Korea. In the election, Choi Jae-hyung, former Chairman of the Board of Audit and Inspection and candidate of the United Future Party, defeated Keum Tae-sup, former Democratic Party leader, and Ko Min-jung, lawmaker from the New Future Democratic Party, to become president.</p>
    <p>Choi Jae-hyung set a unique precedent by serving as the head of the Board of Audit and Inspection under the Moon Jae-in administration, then joining the United Future Party, becoming a lawmaker, and ultimately being elected president. Keum Tae-sup was the first presidential candidate from a Democratic-affiliated party to hail from Seoul. Ko Min-jung, if the New Future Democratic Party is considered part of the Democratic bloc, became the first female presidential candidate from that political lineage. Key issues in the race included debates over purging former student activist factions, conspiracy theories surrounding alleged fraud in the 2024 general election, full-scale adoption of AI-based textbooks, the split within the Democratic Party, low birth rates and aging demographics, and the decline of non-metropolitan regions.</p>
    <p>Choi Jae-hyung stated, 'I believe I was elected because the public supported my economic policies,' and pledged, 'I will be a pro-market president. I will accelerate the deregulation efforts initiated under the Hwang Kyo-ahn administration and fully abolish the inheritance tax.' Keum Tae-sup, in his concession speech, said, 'From now on, I intend to return to my original profession as a lawyer,' and added, 'I take full responsibility and will leave politics. I am truly sorry.' Ko Min-jung, seemingly responding to criticism from parts of the progressive camp, remarked, 'I had hoped for constructive talks on unification with Keum Tae-sup’s camp, but it’s deeply regrettable that things turned out this way.'</p>`)

    <p>Kim Min-seok became the first president from Seoul and secured the Democratic Party’s 15th consecutive year in power.

Cho Eung-cheon ran, claiming to carry on the legacy of President Park Yong-jin, but was unsuccessful. Key issues in the race included free tuition for national and public universities, across-the-board corporate and income tax cuts, conspiracy theories surrounding alleged fraud in the 2024 general election, controversy over pardoning former President Lee Myung-bak, low birth rates and aging demographics, and the decline of non-metropolitan regions.</p>
    <p>Kim Min-seok stated, 'I want to be a president who’s more of an administrator than a politician,' and pledged, 'I will always prioritize pragmatism as a guiding principle and lead Korea’s growth.'

    </h3>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Lawmaker Hong Joon-pyo is currently in a daze. Is it because of Ryu Si-min’s shocking defeat? No, that was two years ago. Today is April 10, 2024, the night of the general election. After betting everything on an alliance with Ryu Si-min and failing, Hong was branded a traitor by virtually every party member. Rejoining the United Future Party became impossible, and he spent the rest of his term as an independent, politically stranded in the third zone. This time, he ran for re-election in Daegu’s Suseong B district. His opponent from the United Future Party had lost to him four years ago, and now, with backing from the Democratic Party, Hong thought victory would be easy. But the exit polls said otherwise…</p>
    <p style="text-align: right;"><i>Let’s go to Daegu’s Suseong B district, one of the most closely watched battlegrounds. United Future Party candidate Lee In-sun is 53.4%, while independent candidate Hong Joon-pyo is 42.1%. Lee In-sun is projected to win!</i></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">It became clear: Daegu voters preferred punishing a traitor over punishing the ruling party. In other words, even in the conservative stronghold of Daegu, Hong had lost, and with no party affiliation, he had nowhere left to go. Struggling to maintain composure, he was hit with another blow: multiple broadcasters had designated Suseong B as a key race and sent reporters to his campaign office, which meant his reaction to the exit polls was broadcast live nationwide. Even in his 2017 presidential defeat, Hong had managed a smile, but this time, he looked like his soul had left his body.</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #EDB4C3;"><i><b>One by one, major broadcasters declare Hwang the likely winner.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">But if that were the end of the story, we wouldn’t be talking about it here. About 30 minutes after the exit polls were released, KBS began live coverage from Hong’s campaign office. A reporter stood in front of the camera, describing the somber mood and people watching the vote count. Then, Hong gave a quiet instruction to a staffer:</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">'Play it.'</p>
    <p style="text-align: right;"><i>When did you stop like that…</i></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Suddenly, the old rock ballad 'The Cloudburst' by Boohwal blasted through the room, drowning out the reporter’s voice. The startled announcer and reporter were briefly shown on air before the live feed was cut. The announcer apologized to viewers for the 'inappropriate footage'. Why such a fuss? Because the song had been banned from KBS broadcasts.</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #ED7B99;"><i><b>Projections gradually shift from 'likely' to 'confirmed'.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">In late 2023, after a new president took over KBS, the public broadcaster conducted a sweeping review of pop songs and banned dozens. One of them was 'The Cloudburst'. Officially, the reason was that the singer had a history of marijuana use, aligning with the Hwang administration’s crackdown on drugs. But everyone knew that was just an excuse. In reality, 'The Cloudburst' - with lyrics mourning someone who left too soon - had become a kind of anthem among Democratic supporters after Ryu Si-min’s defeat. As it gained popularity and was embraced as a protest song, KBS banned it to appease the administration.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Hong had planned this performance in advance. Whether he won or lost, he wanted to make Hwang Kyo-ahn clutch his neck, and it worked. Within minutes, other broadcasters interrupted their exit poll coverage to report on Hong’s 'banned song incident'.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">A smile returned to Hong’s face. He shook hands with his supporters one last time, went home,</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #EF426F;"><i><b>And then, Hwang crosses the final threshold of votes needed, and his victory is officially confirmed.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">And the next day, Hong began preparing to emigrate to Hawaii.</p>`)

    <p>The 2027 South Korean presidential election was held on March 3, 2027, to elect the 21st president of South Korea. In the election, Min Kyung-wook, former leader of the United Future Party, defeated Kim Doo-kwan, former Governor of South Gyeongsang Province and candidate of the Democratic Party, to become president.</p>
    <p>Min Kyung-wook became the first president from Incheon and the first born in the 1960s. He was also seen as the first candidate to win the presidency without distancing himself from his party’s previous president. Kim Doo-kwan made history as the first politician to rise from county governor to presidential candidate. The election result - Min’s victory by a margin of just over 7,000 votes - triggered widespread social unrest. Key issues in the race included political polarization, conspiracy theories surrounding fraud in the 2026 local elections, the Cheong Wa Dae’s restriction of MBC’s press access, debates over renegotiating US-Korea tariffs, low birth rates and aging demographics, and the decline of non-metropolitan regions.</p>

He announced plans to formally request a recount from the National Election Commission.</p>`)

    <span style="font-size: 20px;">Roh, Moon, and Ryu... the 'Gracchi Brothers' of Korea?</span>
    </h3>
    <p style="text-align: left;">On his way to deliver a victory speech, Ryu Si-min sat quietly in the car - not because of the election results, which he considered a foregone conclusion, but because he was reflecting on an interview he gave three years earlier. In that interview, he spoke about one of the most respected figures among modern Koreans, a man who had passed away but remained the spiritual backbone of the Democratic Party. A president he deeply admired, and who admired him in return: Roh Moo-hyun.
</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Host: Chairman Ryu, do you remember the conversation you had with President Roh about whether 'the age of Roh Moo-hyun' would ever come?</i></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Ryu: Yes, of course. That was in July 2002. I had volunteered during the national primary, and once he became the Democratic Party’s nominee, I figured the party would take it from there. I wasn’t even a member at the time, so I just went back to my own work.</i></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Ryu: Then one day, he came to my office, and in the middle of our conversation, he suddenly asked, 'Do you think the age of Roh Moo-hyun will come?'</i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #FFF2B2;"><i><b>One by one, major broadcasters declare Ryu the likely winner.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Ryu: I told him, 'Oh, absolutely. It’s bound to happen. That’s the direction of history.' And he replied, 'But when that time comes, I don’t think I’ll be around.'</i></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Ryu: So I said, 'That’s possible. You’re the first wave of a new tide, and you might not reach where you hoped. But eventually, another wave will come and carry us forward. And if you’re not there when it happens - well, that’s not such a big deal, is it?'</i></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Ryu: I remember saying that in a very cold, rational tone. So after he passed away... I regretted not speaking more warmly.</i></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Ryu: President Roh is no longer with us in the physical sense. But the goals he couldn’t achieve, those he insisted must be pursued, still remain. Some are being realized, others not yet. But I believe they will be, eventually. The age of Roh Moo-hyun hasn’t arrived yet... That’s how I see it.</i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #FFE566;"><i><b>Projections gradually shift from 'likely' to 'confirmed'.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Host: It seems President Roh became even more beloved after leaving office. It’s been ten years since his passing, and many people still speak of his legacy and ideals. Why do you think that is?</i></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Ryu: Public opinion polls on former presidents show Roh consistently at the top in recent years. Combined with Kim Dae-jung, they command an overwhelming majority. But if I were to compare them... Kim Dae-jung is like a towering mountain: admirable from afar, but hard to approach because he lived so upright.</i></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Ryu: President Roh, on the other hand, was easy to like. As the head of the Roh Moo-hyun Foundation, I saw him as a river that never gave up on reaching the sea. That’s why he often signed 'like a river'. After his passing, he feels more like the sea, welcoming every river.</i></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Ryu: As someone entrusted with continuing his legacy, I believe Roh Moo-hyun was like a sea that embraced every stream. We must ensure he finds his place in our society. And I truly believe he was that kind of person, someone people can admire for many different reasons.</i></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">The car arrives at the Democratic Party headquarters. Ryu Si-min steps out and walks through a crowd of cheering supporters,</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #FFD918;"><i><b>And then, Ryu crosses the final threshold of votes needed, and his victory is officially confirmed.</b></i></p><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">And he vows to usher in the long-awaited age of Roh Moo-hyun.</p>

    <span style="font-size: 20px;">2027 South Korean presidential election - Wikipedia</span>
    </h3>
    <p>The 2027 South Korean presidential election was held on March 3, 2027, to elect the 21st president of South Korea. In the election, former Seoul Mayor Na Kyung-won of the United Future Party defeated lawmaker Kwak Sang-eon of the Democratic Party to become president.</p>
    <p>With her victory, Na Kyung-won became South Korea’s second female president after Park Geun-hye, and the first female president with a legal background. Kwak Sang-eon was the first major party presidential candidate born in the 1970s and is also the son-in-law of former President Roh Moo-hyun. Notably, both candidates shared the same registered hometown: Yeongdong County in North Chungcheong Province. Key issues in the race included mass protests against healthcare policy reforms in 2025-2026, political polarization, conspiracy theories surrounding alleged election fraud in the 2024 general election, the cancellation of the Saemangeum International Airport project, low birth rates and aging demographics, and the decline of non-metropolitan regions.</p>
    <p>Na Kyung-won stated, 'It always pained me to think about how much suffering the people endured during the ten years of pro-North dictatorship under Moon Jae-in and Ryu Si-min. I want to promise that I will end all that chaos. We will never go back.' Kwak Sang-eon commented, 'I’m sorry I couldn’t deliver the best outcome in this critical moment. I take full responsibility, so please direct all criticism toward me.' During Kwak’s exit from the press conference, some supporters caused a stir by demanding he reject the election results, sparking controversy.</p>`)
