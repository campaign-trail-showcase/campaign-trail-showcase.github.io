It's fitting, then, that another Presley family member would step forward, pledging to lead Mississippi out of poverty. Much like his famous cousin, Brandon Presley came from humble beginnings. Born into poverty in Northern Mississippi, he rose through the ranks of local politics to get to where he is today.<p>Despite his compelling story and connection to The King, Presley faces a significant political challenge. Mississippi is deep red territory. If Presley is to become the next governor, he will need to convince the people of Mississippi that he is not a coastal elite but a modern-day moderate.</p>",
