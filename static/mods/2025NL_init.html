            <h1>Thank you for playing 2025 Netherlands!</h1>
            <p>It’s quite difficult to find good English-language resources on our politics, but this link does seem to provide quite a decent overview:</p>
            <p><a href=\\\"https://www.expatica.com/nl/living/gov-law-admin/netherlands-political-system-100756/\\\">The political system of the Netherlands</a></p><p><b>About this scenario:</b></p>
            <p>This scenario is essentially (in my view) the most interesting campaign that the next Dutch General Election could become.At the time of writing, the insurgent BBB has recently won the provincial elections, which are essentially our ‘midterms’ because the provinces elect the upper house (‘Eerste Kamer’, also known as the Senate) of our Parliament (Staten-Generaal). The current coalition (composed of VVD, D66, CDA and ChristianUnion) received a beating: they already didn’t have a majority in the Senate, but now they have been reduced even further. This naturally sets some expectations for the elections of the lower house (‘Tweede Kamer’, als known as the House of Representatives). Any new government must have a workable majority in the lower house, otherwise they can be removed by the opposition at any time through a motion of no confidence.</p>
            <p>To craft an interesting scenario, a few assumptions have been made that make it competitive from various angles:</p>
            <li>That the Rutte IV cabinet will not fall prematurely, over nitrogen or otherwise. It can safely be stated that the relations between the parties were put under pressure by the provincial result.</li>
            <li>That the BBB does not collapse under the weight of its own success. This is a problem many newcomers that grow rapidly have to contend with, because new parties usually don’t have an established apparatus to vet and train their candidates. As a result, they are at risk of splitting by political opportunists and scandals.</li>
            <li>That Omtzigt will participate and form his own party to do it. What is in any case clear is that his current situation where he is an independent MP is not sustainable, because our list-based system simply does not allow for it. If he wants to stay in the House of Representatives, he will have to make a move, that could be forming his own party, or joining the BBB.</li>
            <li>Finally, that the Labour Party (PvdA) and the Greens (GroenLinks) fuse together into one party list. Although it seems likely that this is something that will eventually happen, and it is clear that it is being worked towards, it’s not as clear that it will already happen as early as 2025.</li><p>None of these assumptions are certain, and that means that there are a variety of alternate scenario’s that could take place. It’s possible that none of these assumptions come true, and that the VVD will be more or less unopposed once again. It is also possible that if the BBB disappoints, another insurgent like JA21 takes its place.</p>
            <p>In any case, I hope to turn the actual 2025 (or 2023/2024) General Elections into an NCT mod, using this one as a base. I encourage anyone to use this mod as a template for other Dutch (or foreign) elections.</p>
            <p>Thank you to everyone listed in the credits for your contributions. Making this mod has been a pleasure.</p>
