Since 2020, the New Liberty party has split back into its founding parties, Libertarian and Green, over many disputes, largely consisting of the question of whether President Johnson or Vice President Jill Stein should have more sway in the party platform. Because of this, the Libertarian Party has nominated Michael Rectenwald, and the Green Party has nominated unpopular Vice President Jill Stein to run for president. President Johnson has refused to endorse any candidate.
