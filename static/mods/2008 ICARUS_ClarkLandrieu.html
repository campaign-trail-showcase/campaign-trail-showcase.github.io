Icarus dropped down from far above, sporting a stern expression coated in glistening golden armor. It was time for the battle to change history and take his destiny by the horns.</b></p><p><b>It began gloriously; the Hero and Icarus went blow for blow, cut to cut, blood for blood. However, as the moments passed, fear overtook the Hero's mind. Icarus wasn't going down without a fight; perhaps the Harbinger was right. It was getting harder, his vision was getting tighter, and the fight had gone into the later hours of the night. All seemed lost as an opening for Icarus to take his head appeared. However, the Harbinger swept him off his feet and carried out the finishing blow, killing Icarus. The Hero's conquest was finished, but In what may have been the worst outcome, he couldn't celebrate the victory as his own. The Hero owed the Harbinger his life; she wouldn't let him forget that.</b></p>`)

<p>The Bombing of the Roki Tunnel was a United States Air Force strike carried out on October 7, 2008, during the Russo-Georgian War under the command of President Wesley Clark. Ordered with the intent of halting the Russian Army's advance, the tunnel served as a key entry point and the only direct road link between Russia and Georgia. The bombing marked a significant escalation of tension in Russo-American relations.</p><p>The operation was conducted with the consent of Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili. The attack succeeded in temporarily disabling Russian forces from invading Georgia but drew widespread international criticism for the risk of turning a regional conflict into a global war.</p><p>The Bombing of the Roki Tunnel was a United States Air Force strike conducted on August 9, 2008, during the Russo–Georgian War, under the administration of U.S. President Wesley Clark. Ordered with the intent of preventing Russian forces from advancing through the Roki Tunnel — the only direct road link between Russia and Georgia's breakaway region of South Ossetia — the bombing marked a significant escalation in U.S. involvement in the conflict.</p><p>The operation was carried out following a direct request from Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili and amidst urgent consultations in Washington led by Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Defense Carl Levin. The strike succeeded in temporarily disabling the tunnel but drew widespread international condemnation, with critics warning that it risked a direct war between the United States and the Russian Federation.</p><p><b>Background:</b></p><p>The Roki Tunnel (also called Roksky Tunnel, Georgian: როკის გვირაბი; Ossetian: Ручъы тъунел; Russian: Рокский туннель) is a mountain tunnel of the Transkam road through the Greater Caucasus Mountains, north of the village Upper Roka. It is the only road joining North Ossetia–Alania in Russia to South Ossetia, a breakaway republic of Georgia.</p><p>On August 7, fighting broke out between Georgian forces and South Ossetian separatists. Russia responded by mobilizing forces and surging across the border. Despite several attempts in the following weeks, a ceasefire was untenable to both Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili and United States President Wesley Clark.</p><p><b>The Strike</b></p><p>On October 7, following a failed attempt at a ceasefire between Georgia and Russia, U.S. Aircraft stationed aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt in the Black Sea launched "surgical strikes" on various civilian infrastructure, including the southern entrance of the Roki Tunnel. Pentagon officials later labeled it "a defensive strike" for the sole purpose of protecting the Georgian people.</p><p>The strike caused the partial collapse of the tunnel and the effective halt of the Russian Army's advance. Although no Russian soldiers were confirmed to be killed as a result of the strike, the Kremlin reported that over 25 soldiers were harmed. </p><p><b>Reactions</b></p><p><b>United States</b></p><p>President Clark delivered an Oval Office address defending the strike:</p><p> "The United States will no longer stand for the Kremlin's attempts to redraw Europe's borders. The American people stand for the freedom of our Georgian friends and will no longer tolerate Russian interference in their sovereignty."</p><p><b>Russia</b></p><p>Russian President Dmitry Medvedev labeled the bombing as an act of War and placed Russian Strategic forces on high alert. Russian state media described the United States' actions as proof of American interference in their affairs, and the Kremlin vowed retaliation.</p><p><b>Aftermath</b></p><p>As a result of the bombing, Russia's ability to reinforce its position in South Ossetia was severely diminished for weeks, allowing a window for American arms shipments to bolster Georgia's strength. Russian engineers reopened the tunnel weeks later and continued pressing deeper into Georgia.</p><p>Diplomatic fallout was severe, with any chance of a timely ceasefire agreement being off the table. The strike prevented a larger Russian advance and caused the collapse of relations between the United States and Russia.</p><p><b>See also</b></p><p><b>Russo–Georgian War</b></p><p><b>Wesley Clark's presidency</b></p><p><b>U.S.–Russia relations</b></p><p><b>John Kerry </b></p><p><b>Carl Levin </b></p>`)

<p><b>June 11, 2009 || Alice Craig</b></p><p>Personal differences in politics are hard not to come by, but the highly publicized feud between President John McCain and former President Wesley Clark may be the spark that lights the whole world on fire. Since his defeat last November, the former President hasn't missed an interview to offer his sage advice on the state of the country. Except in most instances, his wisdom is traded for a harsh zinger or two about the current commander-in-chief's handling of the Russo-Georgian war.</p><p>Where other political feuds end in policy differences or snarky comments during interviews, like the growing feud between Senators Max Baucus and Tom Daschle, the disdain the 44th and 45th Presidents have for each other has escalated during the 2008 election and shows no signs of ending, so long after it. Wesley Clark blew away his reelection effort by commenting on then Senator McCain's military service on Face The Nation, saying the following: "I don't think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president." While in public, McCain took the high road; behind closed doors, he was looking for blood. He went from boldly standing against Clark's bailout legislation to making his running mate, Joe Lieberman, a personal attack dog.</p> <p>The Russo-Georgian War maintained a similar relentless mentality. Both Presidents swore total and complete support for Georgia and its territorial integrity. Many joked that the debates ended up being a contest of which candidate could swear full loyalty to Georgia than the other. The worries over the economy took a backseat to these men, especially McCain, who showed up late to Clark's "economic war council hearing," which determined the logistics and details of the government response to the recession.</p><p>Instead of addressing the issues that Americans most cared about, the two major party candidates made a spectacle out of the Russo-Georgian War, which would lead to increased American involvement and escalation, even after Clark's eventual November defeat. However, what shocks both the former President and much of the country is the rapid rhetorical U-turn made in the White House. In a statement to the press, President McCain said, "As many of you know I'm as empathic as I am brave. I'm not afraid to punch a bully and both Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin fit that bill, but the greatest bully confronting the American people appears to be the fear of not seeing the future." "So that's why I'm seeking to negotiate this crisis to a halt that is both fair to the Georgian people and to the American people," said McCain, almost holding tears back from his eyes. </p><p>The announcement brought an onslaught of the usual foreign policy hawks that Clark included, as well as the bewilderment of much of McCain's party. However, the reason for such a policy change is alleged to be part of the feud with the former President. White House insiders claim that President McCain more often laments whatever harsh gossip Clark puts on the news than even the grim monthly job reports. With this news reaching Clark's ears, the President turned high school gossip girl went on air, claiming that it was some of McCain's classic "spite-led beliefs." According to Clark, the President is a deeply spiteful man who more often acts out of rage than conviction. He listed that the same happened after George W. Bush allegedly conducted a smear campaign on John McCain in 2000, which led him to nearly cross the aisle twice. </p><p>The President refused to comment on Clark's claims, but the fact that McCain is betraying nearly every word of his campaign for President to get back at Clark may have already taken its toll on his approval rating, with Gallup showing McCain down 8 points from last month. </p><p>The news overjoys diplomats in Europe after months of enduring what felt like a second Cuban Missile Crisis. The French Foreign Ministry was criticized for issuing a statement congratulating the move while taking a dig at the White House's "sibling rivalry." </p><p>It may not be a genuine turning point, but the President's actions may have just saved the world. Something Wesley Clark could never live up to.</p>`)

The whole scared conflict between the United States, its allies, and the Russian Federation, along with its allies, marked the end of the "Golden Period."</p><p>His actions were revered as forward-thinking and ahead of their time.

<p><b>February 2009, By Brooke Jones</b></p><p>Almost eight years since George W. Bush locked eyes with Putin and attempted to see humanity, the soul, and a reason to trust the Russian President, now stands President Jeb Bush, who has never considered himself a foreign policy lightweight. However, by relying on personal diplomacy, hoping to reel in the hooked line that Clark cast, he has fallen prey to similar Boy Scout-like behavior that embarrassed his brother. </p><p>A hastily put together emergency break on what could have been an international meltdown, the White House has confirmed that President Bush has embarked on a quest to "find Putin's soul." The mission? Isn't it obvious? To soothe the fears of an introvert like Jeb, you must cool the situation, the tensions with Moscow following President Clark's bold confrontational strategy.</p><p>To seasoned observers, the President is seeking to reset the clock. Former President Wesley Clark commented on the move, calling it "dangerous" and a "betrayal of Georgia's freedom." By contrast, President Bush has pressed forward with the idea that unlocking the Kremlin's trust requires personal overtures that go beyond threats and into spirituality.</p><p>It's all in the power of eye contact, something the Bushes aren't foreign to. When George Jr. claimed he saw Putin's soul, he too fell prey to the curse, or when he looked Clark in the eyes just before he realized his electoral polling had been one grand mirage. Word has it that the new and improved member of the Bush Clan is well trained via staring contests with Secretary Rice.</p><p>Meanwhile, Russia's mission remains undeterred, tanks roll over American-backed Georgian forces, and attempts to draw a peace deal remain foiled by the sins of the predecessor. </p><p>The White House's insistence is that the only path forward lies in pulling emotion through a deep, heart-to-heart conversation between President Bush and Putin. Whether this lengthy exercise will prove worthy of a Nobel Peace Prize or another geopolitical punchline relies on the idea that one man does indeed have a soul.</p>`)

<p><b>February 2009 – Washington, D.C.</b></p><p>President Mike Huckabee is no stranger to making off-color comments in jest, but the Pastor in Chief outdid himself yesterday. In his latest attempt at embracing levity and humor, Huckabee left parents wincing after choosing the worst moment to crack a joke when attempting to comfort a child.</p><p>At a time when Russo-American relations were at their most tense since the end of the Cold War, President Huckabee has continued business as usual. However, a White House meet-and-greet turned rather sour once Alice Craig, an 8-year-old Kentucky girl, said she was "scared" that the world was going to end. Huckabee, who spent much of the event speaking to kindergarteners oblivious to the state of world affairs, looked dumbfounded. The President chuckled and asked her parents whether they had read her Bible scriptures before, and when they nodded, Huckabee made rhetorical history.</p><p>"Well, look, Alice there is nothing to be afraid of and hey, maybe all of this is just the Rapture we've been waiting for," said Huckabee. With his joke falling to the floor with a thud, a painfully awkward ten seconds of silence followed until a boy at the back of the group shouted, "he's saying we're all gonna die!" The boy's words sent the children screaming and crying as the President looked equally bewildered, and the parents struggled to console their kids.</p><p>"Kids, kids, No no let's calm down," Huckabee said, attempting to cool the situation as the next biggest public headache formed in front of him. In fairness, Huckabee's defenders claim it was just a poorly made joke, but the idea that the President considered tanks shelling Georgia and American weapons firing back as an apocalyptic sign was no good omen for the White House's claims.</p><p>Even some Republican colleagues have noted that Huckabee could have chosen a better time to be Mr. Funny guy.

<p><b>Posted January 17, 2009</b></p><p>The crescendo of creation's end is already upon us. You've witnessed it, lambast it, and let it haunt you. The drumming beats of the war machine, the hums of the future, have become faint, and that's because nothing lies behind the curtain. As his smile is erected in wooden effigies nationwide, the President moves forward. With purpose, with patriotism, and now unity. He runs so we can walk, we worship him, we worship his war.</p><p>Since Cheney's miraculous return to the world stage, the nation has been whipped into a craze that not even his critics can shame. Clark was toppled, but the ventures he undertook wouldn't be left to an anti-war turnout. Cheney championed them because it was not he who fired the first shot. Russian tanks didn't magically find their way into Georgia. </p><p>People have gathered to chant, raise their arms, and holler the President's name. Every park, school, and football field has a statue commemorating the President as he takes the world on a journey. Wooden, grotesque, and hollow, a piece of him now stares down at every American nationwide. It isn't art, nor is it counterculture; it's a thank-you letter.</p><p>If "intellectuals" were any wiser they'd join us and stop fleeing their duty. To free your body of its soul, you must be burnt, whether it's cremation or nuclear fire. Tensions may flare across the globe, Cheney can pound his desk with fury, the outsiders can shake their fists, but inevitability strikes down their protests. Dick's cold feet after screaming "escalate, escalate, escalate" are worthless; he set us upon a path, and it's ours to embrace. Believing in a withering politician's promise to "fix things" is like going to a stripper for love. Your heart will sink as it all hits the floor like a dud, and your body is enveloped with what you're too stubborn to confront.</p><p>Moscow growls, Beijing sharpens its knives, Iran loads its guns, the axis of betrayal will not waver, and neither will Cheney. That's why the rituals comfort us, because they help us cope with what nobody else was willing to accept.</p><p>I've seen it myself. The fire was glorious, as were the fireworks, for once America embraced its unique power to stop giving a fuck. I felt my body begin to float as I looked at the thirty-foot-tall effigy of Dick Cheney. </p><p>Is this America's fate? Are we all unwilling participants in a sick game of chess? Have our leaders abandoned efforts to save the world from themselves? Perhaps, and that's why we don't want peace, we crave purification, we demand that the world as a whole become our next effigy.</p>`)

William Fallon (Ret.)</b></p><p>When the president assembled a conclave of the brightest military minds to help him in his crusade against Iran, the man once dubbed "The Boss of the Middle East" stormed out like a burning building, and now, in a similar fashion, he sits with us to tell the tale.</p><p>Admiral William Fallon, the four-star general who once oversaw the U.S. Central Command, never took glee from entering the spotlight.

"The next catastrophe the American people deserve to know about ahead of time."</p><p><b>THE WAR THAT ALMOST WAS</b></p><p>When John McCain took the oath of office in January, the transition from campaign rhetoric to Oval Office restraint was swift and jarring. While the economy continued its derailment from the tracks, instead of dealing with the immediate problem, he turned his interest toward one topic in classified meetings: Iran.</p><p>"They were like zombies," Fallon says, straight-faced. "Not in a strategic way, but driven by some morale crusade. Iran wasn't just a problem; it was a dragon to be slain."</p><p>Fallon, a seasoned naval officer with decades of experience and rooms filled with vouchers ready to stand up beside him, explained it was as if it were a movie. "The intel was bare bones. The scenarios were worst-case by default. The confidence was astounding, and for what? Because they were weak? They were anything but weak.</p><p>Fallon claimed he made string assertions that were cast aside. He laid out facts, plans, fallout estimates, and a lack of exit strategies. "It was as if I shouted at a wake. The room would quiet until the Vice President said, 'The window is closing.'

<p>Where does one begin to describe John Sidney McCain's journey? If you were to start anywhere, it would begin with his greatest failure: the 2008 election.</p><p>Before the year in question, America had been on a subtle but noticeable decline. When McCain announced his intentions to challenge President Clark, and the Republican establishment, still dominated by Bush-era cronies, most laughed like it was some sick joke. John McCain? The senior Senator who was trampled over in the 2000 primaries? His old foe, George W. Bush, had nearly immediately moved to outmaneuver McCain by forcing his older brother into the race to stop him.</p><p>Despite the odds, McCain fought valiantly against the third monarch of this powerful dynasty. His victories were hard-earned, and the polls were not in his favor. After Iowa, it seemed like all was lost for the seasoned veteran. But then, a political revival in New Hampshire breathed new life into his campaign. Despite the bumps in the road, he persevered and secured the nomination.</p><p>It was a vindication victory built from hard work and intelligent calculation. By the looks of it, his victory was sealed. Knowing the country's economic outlook was grim and most polls favored him 2-1, he had room to make bold moves. This is what would cost him everything, however. When selecting a companion to take in the President, he got cocky and chose Joe Lieberman of Connecticut. It was an apparent slight against the President for all the hell he put his friend through. This decision would cost him everything, and despite Clark's credibility being blown through during the campaign, McCain could never recover from the deficit he had created with the base.</p><p>Election night was an exciting affair that soon plummeted into utter despair for the McCain campaign. The crowd watched as a blue storm swept through the swing states, including some states no one ever believed were in play. McCain began to weep as it all came crashing down on his shoulders. Lieberman held his hand, attempting to raise his mood, but he, too, was distraught by the calamity. McCain would soon lick his wounds and face the music, accepting defeat and the ritual hanging the party would put him through.</p><p>He chose to move forward, taking the blame for his defeat and promising to work with President Clark to ensure America could recover from the ongoing economic crisis. Republicans utterly despised McCain; he botched the chance of a lifetime in an enormous rout. Speculation about a possible primary challenge for the Senator began as early as 2009, due to McCain's slow start in securing campaign donations. Radio talk show host and former congressman J.D. Hayworth became a champion of the rising Tea Party Movement, which had emerged after other establishment Republicans failed to captivate their base. The race was immediately classified as one of the most intense, with negative advertisements flung back and forth. Hayworth labeled McCain soft on Republican issues, saying that the Senator's votes on President Clark's bailout bills deeply hurt his record. John was fighting to survive against this dimwitted huckster. </p><p>When the votes were cast, McCain had lost the primary by over 40,000 votes. It stung; his second defeat was now added to his tarnished legacy. He refused to back down and immediately announced an independent candidacy that quickly became its own party. The Arizona for McCain party had one mission: to keep a sensible voice in Congress. Following in the footsteps of his now-retired friend Senator Joe Lieberman, he took Hayworth and the Democrats who had taken a back seat in this race. </p><p>When it was all said and done, McCain triumphed over Hayworth. It was a close call, but Arizona stuck by its man. McCain was allowed to continue his increasingly roguelike Senate career. McCain remained adamant that he was a Republican, claiming, "I haven't left the party, they left me." </p>`)

<p><b>Phoenix (Reuters) - </b> Republican John McCain lost Tuesday's presidential election in an upset at the hands of President Wesley Clark. The veteran Senator, whose poll numbers had surged to astronomical numbers in September, came crashing down by election day.</p><p>As the blame game began, analysts on all sides of the aisle were scratching their heads. How could this happen? President Clark had completely crashed his campaign by attacking Senator McCain's service.</p><p>Clark's apology for such remarks was equally unpopular and most pathetic. The President's approval rating with veterans had dropped to dangerously low levels.</p><p>Despite a deeply unpopular Democratic President, a sputtering economy, and a generally tough political environment for Democrats, the Senator's hopes and dreams faded on election night.</p><p>Eight years after his original presidential campaign in 2000, Senator McCain often came off as a polished statesman with a respectable record.</p><p>But the surprise outcome isn't one without some reasoning. The Senator's selection of Democrat Joe Lieberman had stirred much criticism from his right flank, culminating in the surge of the Reform Party nominee Pat Buchanan.</p><p>In a solemn concession speech, Senator McCain reflected on his own mistakes and offered nothing but goodwill to the President.</p><p>"This was a difficult campaign but I'm proud of our enthusiastic support," he told his supporters at a somber post-election rally in Phoenix. "Now it's time for our nation to heal and I hope all the best for our nation and President Clark."</p><p>Republican strategist John Feehery said McCain's choice for Vice President had been the most obvious source to blame for the defeat.</p><p>"Senator McCain was often cautioned that a move of picking a running mate from the opposite party would come to this."</p><p>The financial crisis that erupted in September, followed by President Clark's remarks on Face The Nation, had seemingly given McCain an untouchable lead. Gallup polls in late September showed the Senator 15 points ahead of Clark.</p><p><b>OVERCONFIDENCE, BAD OPTICS</b></p><p>It's unavoidable that at least some reason McCain lost comes down simply to Joe Lieberman's selection. A pro-choice Democrat with a strong gay rights record was too much for the Republican base to consider.</p><p>He championed national security concerns and a return to a respectable foreign policy but often neglected the bread and butter issues like abortion. Lieberman only helped double down on these issues, limiting the campaign's range.</p><p>The financial crisis also put conservatism as an ideology under much speculation. While President Clark responded calmly and firmly, Senator McCain's proposals didn't go far enough. The offer of tax cuts and reigning in government spending during a crisis and calamity had fallen flat.</p><p>Aides of the Clark Administration seem equally bewildered by the outcome.</p><p>"It is highly doubtful that anyone will ever have an easier and more advantaged political climate than Senator McCain was given." - Nancy Parrish, White House Chief of Staff.</p><p>Top McCain campaign officials say that the outcome also blindsided McCain.</p><p>What about Lieberman? To most, McCain's pick for Vice President did nothing to sew ties with the right flank and potentially tanked the veteran Senator's campaign.</p><p>High-profile Republicans such as former Senator Rick Santorum rejected McCain partially because of Lieberman.</p><p>"McCain spent the entire summer drawing a contrast between his conservativism and Clark's liberalism and Lieberman through all that through the window," said Republican strategist Scott Reed. "(But) you can't blame Lieberman for the loss. He reigned in the moderate Democrats..."”</p><p>McCain senior adviser Nicolle Wallace said the Arizona senator got a rough deal electorally from Buchanan, who "sabotaged" the Republican ticket. As a result, President Clark was able to revive a long-dead electoral coalition in the South held together by ancestral Democrats, sometimes winning states while barely holding 40% of the vote share.</p><p>"No objective analysis suggests that the Clark campaign wasn't directly helped by Buchanan. It's fair to assume Democrats did their fair share of spreading the word of Buchanan's candidacy."

<p><b>The American Health Insurance Connector Authority reveals a liberal steak to the all-but liberal President</b></p> <p>Published in August, 2011</p> <p>In a small, cramped back-room in the halls of the ever glamorous and historical West Wing we find President Romney, sitting alongside Senate leaders Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell. Reid looks at the President and inquires into his positivity in the project to reinvent the American Healthcare system. McConnell looks more glum than usual, selecting instead to stare in idly at the carpeted floors of this chosen room away from prying eyes. Romney glances at McConnell and asks if he can throw him a bone, McConnell shakes his head, The President then understood he was in fact going at this alone.</p><p>It was perhaps less unorthodox for a Republican to see to do something like this in Massachusetts, territory of the liberal-leaning Republican and the progressive democrat but in national politics the line of left-and-right was not so blurred, nor was the cameras not as bright. His next steps were going to be covered thoroughly, so he’d have to tread carefully.</b></p><p>Months of cajoling, talks across the aisle and a little bit of watering down to bring some Republicans across, the American Healthcare Reform Act was signed into law by President Romney to the relative chagrin of many Republicans he pleaded with to support the law. With re-election around the corner there is muted praise from the democratic candidates and even former Vice President Crist, who since departing early this year has started what some called a hopeless campaign for the Democratic Party’s nomination just one week prior to the signing.</p><p>While the last three years have indeed been confusing politically, Romney’s rather sturdy sense of pride in the bill is evident as he recalled at the signing it was not ‘100% what everyone in this roomed wanted but it will 100% help many Americans, and I cannot think of a more noble and righteous goal in this office I have been bestowed.’</p><p>The question still lays on if the President’s bold bipartisan move will help or hurt him in the national theatre of political discourse but it is perhaps fitting to say this will without a shadow of a doubt be the most historically significant moment of his first term, perhaps with the exception of the success of Operation Neptune Spear this past spring. President Romney has absconded from Republican thinking of healthcare, will the party absconded from him next November and will he lose happily with a cleared conscience?</p>`)

<p><b>April 18, 2010 </b>|| Albuquerque, New Mexico - In a dusty border town cafe just south of Arizona, 32-year-old Enrique Balbado finishes the final chapter of his memoir, "The Healing Hike Home: How I Self-Deported in 2010 and Found Myself, Barefoot and Unemployed."</p> <p>Enrique is one of the thousands of immigrants who followed President Mitt Romney's self-deportation policy described as "a humane, optional exit strategy for people who have jobs and families, but also the audacity to want to stay."</p> <p>"I remember when ICE agents first knocked on my door," Enrique says. "They were so gentle suggesting I deport myself, they went through all my belongings hurrying me along and my house was torn apart but they assured me this was the most humane possible way to do it."</p><p>Motivated by Romney's immigration policy and ICE agents banging down his door, Enrique sold his truck, quit his landscaping job, and began walking toward Mexico. "I didn't even know which way was south," he admits. "I used the stars, the scent of cilantro, and an outdated Taco Bell receipt with a map on the back."</b></p><p>Romney's presidency now hailed as a success story for the National Etiquette Restoration Act, was marked by sweeping reforms, including the Voluntary Exodus Encouragement Act, which replaced all immigration forms with a mirror and a post-it note reading, "You know what to do."</p><p>Critics like Governor Rick Perry, who conducts more forceful immigration reform in Texas, like the establishment of Texans "own Guantanamo" on a floating island built by immigrants. Romney responded to the attacks, stating, "Look, if people want to stay in America, they'll stay. But they'll go if they don't want to be hassled by federal agents disguised as Pizza Hut delivery drivers. That's the free market of residence."</p><p>Enrique’s journey was no easy task. "I was halfway through Arizona when I realized I forgot my passport. But I remembered Mitt said, 'When life gives you immigration status, give it back like a gentleman.' So I kept walking."</p><p>Enrique rebuilt his life in Sonora as a freelance sombrero consultant and occasionally appears back in America for TED Talks, giving motivational speeches about leaving the country.</p><p>No matter the struggle, Enrique holds no ill will toward the President. "Romney taught me something. If you don't belong somewhere, you should definitely leave quietly and let the economy figure it out. That's the American way."</p><p>When confronted, President Romney nodded and said, "Good. The system works."</p>`)

<p><b>By Associated Press – June 23, 2010</b></p><p>Salt Lake City, Utah || It's safe to say the former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney's decision to throw his hat into the ring of Utah Senatorial politics only 2 years after a crushing defeat presidentially was a poor idea.</p><p>Romney was once the face of the GOP, a rising star born to be president. While many on the right harbored doubts about his ability and often lambasted his record, Romney presented himself as a national conservative. He played well with the party's bread and butter on the border and made himself a leading voice of conservative opposition to the Clark administration. </p><p>When he clinched the nomination with the help of Governor Charlie Crist securing the Florida contest for him, it was assumed that he would carry similar victories into the general election. However, disaster struck, and Romney's campaign would end not only in defeat but a resounding one. Clark surpassed his winning coalition in 2004 and proved that his brand of liberalism was here to stay, while Romney's old-guard brand of "more of the same" was further rejected by the Republican Party's base.</p><p>Still, defeat did not discourage Romney; in fact, it seemingly put fire in his belly. Aides to the Romney campaign he shelled out blame to nearly everyone from the party's right flank, discriminating against his Mormon faith, to his running mate making a fool of the ticket by being too pro-environment. Romney, now far from his time serving in Massachusetts, completed his move to Utah politics and waited for an opportunity to satiate his hunger for another shot. </p><p>That opportunity arose from Incumbent Senator Bob Bennett's failure to secure his own reelection. While Romney publicly supported Bennett, he floated the possibility of himself as a compromise candidate when it became clear that the Utah state Republican convention would not renominate Bennett. So, with convention racketeering and classic boardroom-like backstabbing, Bennet's name was removed from consideration, replaced with his own.</p><p>However, insurgent Tea Party Republican Mike Lee was not settling for any compromise and labeled Romney's campaign as a "managerial facade" and that his brand of Republicanism "had to go." </p><p>The question remained if Romney could successfully tap into his Mormon roots to secure Bennett's seat for the old guard. Finally, after multiple ballots, we would have our answer. He could not. In a widely publicized upset, the Utah Convention would place Lee's name above Romney's 53% to 47%. </p><p>Political pundits call it the "Tuesday Murder Hour" because Romney's defeat coincided with multiple establishment primary defeats, such as Charlie Crist's failure to secure the Republican nomination for Florida governor. </p> <p>And what of Romney? After conceding defeat to Lee, the former governor reportedly made plans to relocate again. Some experts claim that Romney has become delirious with post-election loss fever, as many rumors suggest he plans to make another visit to Michigan, the state where his father, George Romney, once reigned supreme. </p><p>In his concession speech, Romney claimed, "this isn't the end of my journey America, it's only the beginning." </p><p>Only time will tell if there are more chapters to be written in Romney's political future. </p>`)

<p>Tuesday, <b>November 3rd, 1992</b>, Republicans overlooked a blue abyss consuming their president whole. Just 4 years prior, the President claimed victory in the Sunshine State by over 22 points. This time around, the President barely scraped by, just under 2 points ahead of Clinton, marking a nationwide trend. Republican pundits weren't sure that George H.W. Bush would surpass 100 electoral votes until late in the night. </p><p>Republicans were shaken from such a terrible experience after the President's popularity reached its peak just 1 year before his face hitting the curb. They put their eggs in Bob Dole's basket. However, after what was labeled a Republican Revolution, 2 years into Clinton's term, he still met a nearly identical conclusion.</p><p>Whatever the reason that the 90s were so cruel to the Republican banner, the Bush name still had weight. The 1994 midterms saw his offspring step into the fray, one successful in Texas and the other stumbling behind. While Jeb would later redeem himself, the Republican Party couldn't help but fawn over his brother. A strong red state governor able to shatter the Clinton coalition. </p><p>Despite a spirited challenge from Senator John McCain, George W. Bush would be crowned king of the Republican Party, and despite court ruling controversies and lacking the popular vote's conscience, he'd be the next President of the United States. The Bush Clan was back in style with the mandate of 9/11, carrying him to congressional victories in the midterms. It was certain that he'd have an electoral stick no one was willing to challenge. Instead, through missteps in Iraq, he would face an electoral heavyweight in General Wesley K. Clark, who took his advantages and turned them against him. </p><p>Tuesday, <b>November 2nd, 2004</b>, the Republican Party's hopes and plans would be torn down. A blue storm would sweep America off its feet and enable a political novice to take the President down. Republicans were back to square one, a one-term Bush presidency tossed out of the White House. George Junior would leave his post quietly, accepting his fate. The rounds of political cannibalization of the people who allowed this to happen took place, and the desire for a fresh face in 2008 took precedence.</p><p>But instead, familiar genes would float in speculation. Jeb Bush, longing for a chance to step up to the plate after being outpaced by his little brother, began to make his rounds in the media. He wouldn't go unchallenged, of course; men like John McCain went after him hard. However, circumstances in the Florida Governor's favor took the primaries by storm. </p><p>Again, the Republican Party would allow itself to be headed by the Bush name. Despite public fatigue with such a dynasty, the state of the economy dominated headlines. Wesley Clark had hit an economic iceberg, and his ship was sinking fast. Republicans had regained a sense of optimism that not only would they win but also destroy the Democratic Party. The nation was to be swallowed by a red riptide.</p><p>Tuesday, <b>November 4th, 2008</b>, came faster than expected. The election season was marked by poison, meanness, and harshness. All expectations held that, despite polls tightening up by the end, Bush would win. Then came the results: a strangely familiar feeling, collective deja vu spread throughout the campaign headquarters. Here they were again, watching the Democrats' numbers swarm in the key swing states and even worse grow in numbers unthinkable in states that were once red four years ago. Jeb had done it, lost the election for his party, worse than his own brother, and most humiliating for his family name. In an election so favorable, so jaded against the incumbent, he collapsed.</p><p>The post-mortem was quick and emotionless. Republicans cursed the Bush family name and all those who bear it. Perhaps God had forsaken the family, or more sinister elements were at play. Whatever the case, it mattered not. Republicans were out of power for another four years without a leader not named Bush since 1988. </p><p>The question remains, why? Why did we need to go through this ritual again? It's safe to say that the establishment leadership is nervous, for they are at the behest of the fiery rage of the Republican base. What's more concerning is that, despite everything, early polling for the 2012 Republican nomination has the former President George W. Bush in its top five potential candidates. The feeling that Republicans may never escape such a death spiral is felt within all wings of the party. As they draw knives to one another, the potential that another Bush candidacy could slide through the cracks of a political civil war becomes the nightmare scenario for Republicans and the dream for the Democratic Party.</p>`)

Neoconservative icons were crawling out of the woodwork it lambast his foreign policy.</p><p>But despite all these factors, including a deeply unpopular Democratic President, a sputtering economy, and a generally tough political environment for Democrats, the former Governor met the same fate his brother did four years prior and his father faced in 1992.</p><p>Just 4 years ago, President George W. Bush's political career ended with General Clark in what many also called a shocking upset. At the time, it was unthinkable that the man who oversaw the events of 9/11, sporting a once untouchable approval rating, could fall flat in spectacular fashion.</p><p>Now, with his brother meeting a similar fate in what should have been even easier circumstances, most are asking if the Bush name is a curse or if Wesley Clark is untouchable.</p><p>In a bewildered concession speech, the former Governor congratulated the President and spoke of the need to unite behind the President during this crisis.</p><p>"These results may not be what we all wanted, but that doesn't take away from the issues we brought attention to during this campaign," he told his supporters at a somber post-election rally in Miami. "I hope President Clark takes note of this and pray that he can lead our nation into a greater future during his second term."</p><pRepublican strategist John Feehery was equally baffled by the results, struggling to understand why he alluded to a gap between Bush and the Republican base.</p><p>"Governor Bush struggled to connect with key voting demographics below college educated voters. Possibly his immigration and education stances being liberally prone like his primary opponents often highlighted."</p><p>The primary opponent Feehery is referring to was Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who often attacked Bush for his weak stance on immigration and suggested many dedicated Republicans could be turned off by it.</p><p><b>OUT OF TOUCH, EASILY EXPOSED</b></p><p>It's hard not to blame the range of different avenues Democrats could attack Bush from, whether it was his handling of the Schiavo Case, unpopular social issues stances, or even the controversy surrounding the 2000 Florida recounts brought up.</p><p>He first championed his foreign policy, attacking President Clark's handling of the war in Iraq. While media think tanks often agreed with Bush, exit polls display Iraq as either the 3rd or 4th most important issue of the election.</p><p>The financial crisis had put economic solutions at the forefront of people's concerns. While President Clark responded calmly and firmly, Governor Bush's proposals often didn't go far enough for voters. The offer of tax cuts and reigning in government spending during a crisis and calamity had fallen flat.</p><p>Aides of the Clark Administration seem equally bewildered by the outcome.</p><p>"It is highly doubtful that anyone will ever have an easier and more advantaged political climate than Governor Bush was given." - Nancy Parrish, White House Chief of Staff.</p><p>Top Bush campaign officials say that the outcome was of huge disappointment and surprise to Jeb.</p><p>What about Ridge? To most, the selection of the former Pennsylvania Governor and Homeland Security Secretary did little to help sew toes with Bush's right flank, and in return, it brought about the underlying distrust of the George W.

<p><b>March 11, 2009 – Washington, D.C.</b></p><p>Leaked cellphone footage of President Rudy Giuliani discussing the plummeting jobs market revealed just how grim the economic forecasts have become. Public morale sank following the release of the Department of Labor's brutal February employment figures, which counted over 811,000 jobs lost since January. The February forecast initially projected a lighter figure of around 450,000 jobs lost, but the number surged beyond the losses of January, indicating that this recession is not ending anytime soon.</p><p>At a time when Americans look to their President for guidance, the Giuliani administration has been remarkably silent. Political pundits claim that the President is attempting to keep his plans airtight after the January public scare, when a leaked memo from White House staff revealed that the President was only considering a stimulus package of just over $100 million at the time. While the White House denies the memo's claim, the public backlash stirred further losses in the January jobs report. </p><p>The earth-shattering news, however, lies in a leaked video of President Giuliani discussing the monthly jobs report with Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao. "I know how this is going to sound but I need the monthly jobs reports to stop going public," Giuliani said while drinking a glass of wine. "Fact of the matter is that these reports are only adding fuel to the fire and are just depressing people," the President added. While his Labor Secretary argued against such a move, Giuliani was having none of it.</p><p>"Look, let's face it, we don't know how to address the elephant in the room so instead of throwing a nationwide pity party let's come up with some good news," said Giuliani. "Like what Mr. President," an aide questioned him off camera. "I don't know, how about the ground hog not seeing its shadow, anything to get the press off my ass," Giuliani answered.</p><p>The leak did anything but help the President stay above the fray, as a bipartisan lineup of concerned heads voiced their concerns. "Smothering the markets in false information is dangerous and unconstitutional," said Senator Tom Daschle (D-SD). </p><p>The public frenzy of another scandal plaguing an already sacked administration serves to fuel disgruntled Americans hoping for transparency from their government. Giuliani may have won the battle in defeating Wesley Clark last November, but it seems he's losing the war against his own jaw.</p>`)

<p><b>Indianapolis (Reuters) - </b>Republican Mike Pence lost Tuesday's presidential election after one of the most tumultuous and unpredictable campaigns in modern election history. Ascending to the Republican nomination after Rudy Giuliani dropped out of the presidential race due to scandals involving his security detail, which had billed the city for trips related to his affair with Judith Nathan, who would later become his third wife, was revealed in the media.</p><p>As the blame game began, analysts pointed fingers in many directions, but the most common denominator ended up becoming Rudy Giuliani. Pence, in many ways, saved the Republican Party from what could have been a much steeper cliff. According to exit polls, over 57% of Americans stated that they wouldn't have supported Rudy Giuliani if he were still the Republican, while only 47% of voters said they had strong feelings against Pence. </p><p>While the Mayor's presence on the minds of voters evaporated, one thing became certain: Pence would not win the election via the popular vote. President Clark's leadership, along with a narrative of political stability surrounding his reelection effort, would make it nearly impossible to recover the popular vote.</p><p>Despite swapping tickets at the last minute, an opportunity remained to pull off an electoral upset. The incumbent remained unpopular, and the economy continued to sputter out. There appeared to be a path, regardless of Pence's changing of cracking the overall raw vote ceiling. State economies that had been crushed, such as Michigan and Florida, still presented an odd viability to the Republican campaign.</p><p> However, the Congressman failed to present America with a compelling agenda and at times sounded cold and callous toward the circumstances that most voters were facing. </p><p>In a robotic concession speech late Tuesday, Pence kept his words plain and of the point.</p><p>"America to me as it is to many of us, remains the beacon which the world looks toward," he told his supporters at a somber post-election rally in Indiana. "We fought for what was right, the way God would want us to, I'm thankful for the opportunity given to me." </p><p>Republican strategist John Feehery said Pence, while serving to polarize an electorate that could have jumped ship under Giuliani, had failed to broaden his reach.</p><p>"He got the people we needed to get into the voting booths to avoid a disaster, but his cleanup work never reached people in the swing states." </p><p>The financial crisis had solidified the idea of a Giuliani victory in the minds of many, but the circumstances that brought Pence to become the leading man of the Republican Party had shifted the electorate wildly.</p><p><b>EASY CLIMATE, TOUGH SELL</b></p><p>Pence had to manufacture a new platform, a new message, and a way to make voters forget the name Rudy Giuliani at the last minute. Much of his electoral handiwork did the trick, but the inevitable reality was that Rudy's train wreck would ultimately lead to an impasse. </p><p>Pence championed himself as a true conservative while labeling the Clark administration with whatever rhetorical dogma he could throw.</p><p>"Pence ran on an agenda that was out of line with the American people's values. We promised to help people, he did the opposite." - Terry McAuliffe, White House Chief of Staff.</p><p>Top Pence allies stood by him even after defeat. Some, like former Governor Mike Huckabee, even praised the Congressman for bringing Republican values back to the table, and some even floated the possibility of Pence becoming Speaker of the House in the future.  </p><p>What about Rice? To most, Pence's pick for Vice President established strong foreign policy credibility and proved herself on the debate stage.</p><p>Pence's senior advisor, Karl Rove, commented on the defeat as follows.</p><p>"Pence provided America with a choice grounded in reality, the President offered fantasy and tales of grandeur," Rove told reporters at the Pence campaign headquarters in Indianapolis. "No Republican would have come out of the fire. Pence did any better, we should thank him for his service."</b>`)

<p><b>New York City (Reuters) - </b> Republican Rudy Giuliani lost Tuesday's presidential election in a humiliating defeat at the hands of President Wesley Clark. The celebrity Mayor, whose fame in politics could only be rivaled by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, was expected to take the polls by storm but came up short.</p><p>As the blame game began, analysts said his many weaknesses were exposed little by little. The firefighter revolting, his affairs, his ties to Bernard Kerik—it all came crashing down on him. President Clark dutifully exploited this and made the election more about Rudy's blemishes than the disaster he brewed in Iraq, not to mention the collapsing economy.</p><p>Giuliani's attempts to portray President Clark as a tax-raising socialist who let terrorists take over Iraq grew stale with moderates, and whatever gains he made with them, he lost double the evangelicals in the South.</p><p>Despite a deeply unpopular Democratic President with a sputtering economy and a generally tough political environment for Democrats, the Mayor lost by the fundamentals in running a campaign.</p><p>After 7 years of preparing his political ascendancy to the presidency, Giuliani entered with a monumental lead and was ready to take on the issues of the working class.</p><p>But the Mayor failed to respond to the crisis with effective language, at times sounding callous and heartless and sometimes aloof to the troubles facing everyday Americans. Party strategists point to Giuliani's incoherent economic messaging, which ranged from conservative to the same "Nanny" approach he often criticized.</p><p>In a difficult-to-hear concession speech late Tuesday, the former Mayor reflected on the campaign and seemingly struggled to accept blame for his failure.</p><p>"When I think back to everything I accomplished this campaign, I'm proud of the work I've done for you," he told his supporters at a somber post-election rally in New York. We fought hard for those who felt abandoned by Democrats and for the people we lost on 9/11."</p><p>Republican strategist John Feehery said Giuliani's deep ties to the Bush administration might have ended up becoming a net negative with sore wounds prevailing from Iraq.</p><p>"He was always seen next to Bush advisors like Condoleezza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld. People who were well known to the general public as war propeteers."</p><p>The financial crisis that erupted in September had seemingly solidified Giuliani's victory to most, but in early October, evidence of him paying off a mistress with city funds resurfaced, blowing through much of the Mayor's lead.</p><p><b>EASY CLIMATE, MASSIVE GAFFES</b></p><p>Giuliani deeply wounded himself after refusing to answer a question about whether or not he'd pardon his former associate Bernard Kerik if elected president. Among other gaffes, he often became his own worst enemy.</p><p>He championed himself as someone above it all while being in touch with people's needs. This backfired on many of his proposals, and Giuliani often came off as elitist and running on vanity.</p><p>The financial crisis also put Giuliani's "conservativism" under speculation. While President Clark came off as calm and strong in his response, the Mayor appeared aloof to what Americans needed. This was especially so when he got into a public feud with Senator Hillary Clinton over her broad economic plan, including freezing foreclosures nationwide.</p><p>Aides say Giuliani's response to the economic crisis muddied the debate and gave President Clark an opening.</p><p>"It is highly doubtful that anyone will ever have an easier and more advantaged political climate than Mayor Giuliani was given." - Nancy Parrish, White House Chief of Staff.</p><p>Top Giuliani aids say the Mayor is deeply bitter about his former campaign allies, like Senator Sam Brownback, calling on him to drop out of the race in favor of his running mate, Representative Mike Pence of Indiana.</p><p>What about Pence? To most, Giuliani's pick for Vice President helped stem the bleeding of votes to any fringe third-party candidates and contrasted well with Giuliani's more high-class profile with a lowly representative of Indiana.</p><p>Giuliani Senior Advisor Condoleezza Rice commented on the media portraying the Mayor unfairly in October.</p><p>"There's no doubt that the media portrayed the Clark and Giuliani campaigns extremely differently," Rice told reporters at the Giuliani campaign headquarters in New York.

<p><b>By Juliana Malini</b></p><p>11:23 PM March 13th</p><p>Newly inaugurated President <b>Ron Paul</b> staked opposition to future government interference in the ongoing recession well before his climactic victory against then-President <b>Wesley Clark</b>. Clark, who oversaw the beginning of the global recession that many economists argue started near the end of 2007, ran on a platform of rapid government response to the crisis. Paul, by contrast, spearheaded the End The Fed movement, which sought to close the Federal Reserve and end all federal government meddling in fiscal affairs.</p><p>After a spirited campaign against the establishment in the Republican primaries, Paul benefited from high independent support and even crossover support with liberal Democrats frustrated by Clark's foreign policy. Clark became the face of rage against the establishment, corporate meddling, and dishonest foreign policy focus. Soon after, Paul would be declared the race's victor once the votes were cast, solidifying an anti-establishment revolution.</p><p>Staying true to his word, President Paul quickly reined in both the Treasury and Reserve's moves to combat the recession. When word of Bank Of America's hardship hit the Oval Office, Paul valiantly declared, "Not a dime of the American taxpayer's money will go into the hands of a banker who failed his job." The Dow Jones Industrial Index plummeted 4% points just at the news of his announcement and would drop another 5% once Bank Of America collapsed. Repeating much of the sorrow impacting financial markets in the wake of Lehman's Brothers failure, stock markets nationwide plummeted.<p>President Paul sits jovial at the desk of American leadership, smiling with pride, believing it's all a market correction. Only a few months into his presidency, his approval rating sits at a historic low of 29% against 58% disapprove. Something he seems quite proud of as if he's to be a Jesus-like figure who will be vindicated by time.</p><p>The Republican establishment, particularly in the Senate, is still fighting in Michigan courtrooms to seat Representative <b>Justin Amash</b>, who beat Senator <b>Sanders Levin</b> by a historically close margin of less than 200 votes. Levin was appointed to finish the term of his brother <b>Carl Levin</b>, who was nominated Secretary of Defense by <b>Wesley Clark</b> after he was inaugurated.

<p><b>Dallas (Reuters) - </b> Republican Ron Paul lost Tuesday's presidential election at the hands of President Wesley Clark. The Libertarian-minded Congressman, whose unorthodox positions on most issues were expected to shake up the race heavily, sadly, it didn't shake how he hoped it would.</p><p>As the blame game began, analysts said his repudiation of the establishment and Senator Rick Santorum's third-party bid were among his greatest challenges to overcome. The old newsletters, past racist and antisemitic remarks, his unpopular platform—it all came crashing down on him. President Clark dutifully exploited this to avoid the challenge of his revolting left flank and set the theme of the election on Paul's unpopularity.</p><p>Paul's unstable coalition, bound by opposing President Clark's neoliberalism, ran out of steam short of its destination, and whatever gains he made with left-wing activists cost him conservative votes in the South.</p><p>Despite a deeply unpopular Democratic President, a sputtering economy, and a generally tough political environment for Democrats, the Congressman failed to grasp the fundamentals of most issues.</p><p>Eighteen years after his initial run for President with the libertarian label, he was expected to champion the anti-war coalition's banner, but a third-party sabotage candidacy drained him with key Republican demographics.</p><p>But Paul's greatest failure was of his own making. His record was electoral poison, especially when his stance on Social Security was brought to the forefront, scaring the Republican base of the 65-and-older crowd. Furthermore, he alienated the traditional Republican farm states with his outspoken criticism of farm subsidies.</p><p>In a tough-pill-to-swallow concession speech, the Representative noted the massive achievement this election was for the libertarian movement.</p><p>"We may have lost, but the ideas brought forth prove that the libertarian experiment can be accomplished," he told his supporters at a somber post-election rally in Dallas. We fought hard against the establishment, and while the warmongering free-spending free-thinkers may have won this battle, the war for greater libertarian thought marches on!"</p><p>Republican strategist John Feehery said Paul's inability to compromise with the Republican establishment did him in.</p><p>"There were very few appealing aspects of Ron Paul's candidacy to the average Republican voter. He was too relaxed on social issues and let's not even get started on his foreign policy."</p><p>The financial crisis that erupted in September had seemingly boosted confidence in his candidacy, but when it came to solutions to the crisis, the appeal slowly faded away.</p><p><b>EASY CLIMATE, SCATHING SCRUTINY</b></p><p>Paul suffered heavy losses after his association with the Ron Paul Newsletter was brought to the forefront of the campaign, which highlighted past racist and antisemitic remarks.</p><p>He championed himself as the choice of both the anti-war left and right but found that these two groups were incompatible on several issues like abortion and economics.</p><p>The financial crisis initially vindicated Paul's platform as he championed ideas like ending the Federal Reserve. While President Clark focused on bailing financial institutions, Paul advocated smashing the established financial norms. The movement he sparked drew crowds, but its limited reach grew apparent when most desperately pleaded for a firm government response.</p><p>Aides say Paul's response to the crisis, while helping keep a dedicated following, did little to combat the stigma of Paul as a radical.</p><p>"It is highly doubtful that any Republican will collapse in the fasion that the Paul campaign has." - Nancy Parrish, White House Chief of Staff.</p><p>Top Paul aides say the Congressman is bitter and frustrated over the surprisingly popular conservative party candidacy of Rick Santorum.</p><p>What about Johnson? To most, Paul's selection of former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson only doubled down on his outsider appeal and further drove a divide between Paul and the Republican establishment.</p><p>Paul's Press Secretary Jesse Benton commented that the Republican establishment lost them this campaign.</p><p>"There's no doubt that the Republican establishments refusal to get behind our campaign lost us this election," Benton told reporters at the Giuliani campaign headquarters in New York. "Congressman Paul ran a fantastic campaign that will be hailed for generations as a trendsetter, we had the best funding of any Republican campaign and lost because other Republicans sabotaged our efforts."</p><p>Editing by Alan Elsner</p><p>Our Standards: <br>The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</br></p>`)

<p>2008 offered little to no good omens or blessings of any kind. It was a year riddled with economic malpractice and administrative incompetence. But in that fog stood Mike Huckabee and his number two, Fred Thompson, offering solutions that sounded good on paper but lit aflame when put under scrutiny. Thus, the keeper of the presidential flame remained President Wesley Clark, who easily repelled the Arkansas/Tennessee duo to the Republican Party's utter dismay.</p><p>Since his humbling defeat, Huckabee spent a healthy amount of time brooding and wallowing in his defeat, but despite his failure, he remained committed to the Christian cause. And so the former governor, with the help of his former running mate and actor Fred Thompson, jammed his foot into the door of Hollywood with a mission. To save American culture via any means necessary. </p><p><b>So what does Hollywood have to do with it? Well, according to Mike, Hollywood is;</b></p><p>"A corrosive element plaguing American culture, allowing atheistic thinking to infest the American mindset."</p><p>With eyes on his next target, focused and prepared, he leaped forward to create an organization called Scripture Watchdog that describes itself as "a grassroots movement against the objectification of the Bible and delegitimization of the people in it." Essentially, he created an activist group except it had the money to actually sue and harass studios that dared make a mockery of the sacred texts.</p><p>While the organization had gotten off to a slow start in its early development, it soon gained rapid momentum by taking on a major Warner Bros property, Constantine. Constantine, starring Keanu Reeves, took the box office by storm in 2005 and again in 2008 with the release of Constantine: City of Demons. The series follows John Constantine, an exorcist with the ability to travel between Earth and hell and communicate with half-demons and half-angels without issue. The problem arises from Constantine 2 portraying the archangel Michael in a negative light, which Huckabee's organization went on the offensive to fight against.</p><p>Meanwhile, his partner was scoring Emmy nominations for his portrayal of William Jennings Bryan in Scopes Monkey, which ironically is a criticism of many of the ideals Huckabee is fighting for. Huckabee found new crusades in taking on comic book nerds.</p><p><b>The official boycott of Constantine 2 is underway, with Scripture Watchdog making the following statement:</b></p><p>"Warner Brothers' consistent and abhorrent attempts to belittle holy scripture are a damning signal of the studio's beliefs. The mockery of the Bible in Constantine 2 is an affront to the lord."</p><p>America may have rejected the spoken word of Mike Huckabee. Still, Hollywood is likely to continue dealing with the written word in courts for the foreseeable future.</p>`)

<p><b>Hope (Reuters) - </b>—Republican Mike Huckabee lost Tuesday's presidential election in an upset defeat at the behest of President Wesley K. Clark. The rising star Governor of Arkansas, who took the mantle of the Republican nomination and fended off fierce establishment competitors, was expected to take the incumbent President to task but came up short.</p><p>As the blame game began, Republican analysts seemed to be scratching their heads while most Democrats stood vindicated in their predictions. A leaked memo from a Democratic staffer revealed that most Democrats hoped Republicans would nominate Huckabee, remarking that he'd be "their McGovern."</p><p>Huckabee's attempts to chastise Clark for the situation in Iraq fell flat when he couldn't correctly articulate a winning solution. Other Republican candidates for the nomination had often attacked the former Governor for his foreign policy know-how and lack thereof. It appears they had a point.</p><p>Despite a deeply unpopular Democratic President, a sputtering economy, and a generally tough political environment for Democrats, the former Governor lost sight of the fundamentals.</p><p>The blindsided establishment never saw Huckabee coming, and Republicans believed that the same trend would launch Huckabee into the White House.</p><p>However, the Governor failed to respond to the crisis with reasonable solutions, and when he did have a good point, it was overshadowed by his more extreme positions. Party strategists point to Huckabee's advocation for another constitutional convention as a turn-off to moderates.</p><p>In a humbling concession speech late Tuesday, the former Governor reflected on the campaign and held a moment for prayer congratulating President Clark.</p><p>"This was truly a spectacular campaign and i'm glad we could share it together," he told his supporters at a somber post-election rally in Hope. "I pray for the safety of our troops and hope that President Clark will keep them safe."</p><p>Republican strategist John Feehery said Huckabee's repeated alienation of his Republican opponents like Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney would lead to a fractured party.</p><p>"He had alienated the Mormons, the catholics, the Jewish. He made slights against key demographics he needed right win."</p><p>President Clark held an early lead in the polls, which soon collapsed amid the failure of Lehman Brothers. The economic calamity had cemented the idea that it was Huckabee's election to lose now.</p><p><b>EASY CLIMATE, GAFFES AND STUPIDITY</b></p><p>Among the greatest gaffes the former Governor made on the campaign trail, his insensitive references to the Holocaust when making different points had cut down on the lead gained in September.</p><p>He championed himself as inclusive to all religions, but his folksy' preaching rhetoric became a turn-off to most outside the protestant faith.</p><p>The financial crisis also highlighted Huckabee's spending habits. While most Republicans demanded cutting down on spending, Huckabee advocated for massive infrastructure projects.</p><p>Aides say Huckabee's response to the economic crisis created a rift between himself and common-sense conservatives, allowing an opening for President Clark to thread the needle.</p><p>"Truthfully we had expected this outcome, our internal polling consistently showed Huckabee trailing as opposed to some of his primary opponents." - Nancy Parrish, White House Chief of Staff.</p><p>Top Huckabee campaign officials say the Governor was extremely upset that so-called "foreign policy experts" with the Republican Party were reluctant to back him.</p><p>What about Thompson? To most, Huckabee's choice for Vice President united the party establishment worried about his lack of foreign policy expertise. While not providing strategic regional balance, Thompson was a common sense conservative Huckabee needed.</p><p>Huckabee's campaign manager, Ed Rollins, commented that the media was portraying the former Governor unfairly.</p><p>"The world is collapsing under Clark's oversight but the media instead chose to criticize Huckabee's as untested?

<p>September 9th</p><p>If God exists, the people of Louisiana must have drawn his scorn. After barely scraping by with the help of Clark's hands-on approach, which Republicans criticized as overly intrusive state government duties, Louisiana limped from it, damaged but alive. The population of New Orleans, although substantially depleted, remained strong. </p><p>Then came the 2008 recession, which ripped through economies nationwide. Such a crisis called for drastic measures, some of which were adopted through the Republican Party's platform, spearheaded by none other than Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas. Brownback, a powerful speaker for the Constitutional Conservatives who flooded the 2006 midterms with harsh campaigning against President Clark's failed Freedom to Marry Act, campaigned against the deficit. Using the Republican platform to spread his own manifesto, which planned to radically cut taxes across all brackets to allow private investment to flourish. </p><p>Although the Republican ticket would go on to lose to President Clark, Brownback's passionate and spirited advocacy for such ideas grew support among red-state governors, such as Louisiana's Bobby Jindal. Jindal introduced the "Tax Swap," which aimed to eliminate income taxes and trim several other tax codes in an effort to restore private investment in Louisiana. The bill, while popular among the base, was fiercely opposed by Louisiana Democrats, who were concerned that their state would go bankrupt. Yet their efforts proved useless after the 2008 elections severely damaged their standing in the legislature.</p><p>Brownback commended the signing as a victory for all under God's Republican Party. </p><p>Two years later, it's as if we are watching a horror film live. The state government, plagued by recurring budget shortfalls and economic downsizing, now faces unprecedented pandemonium as New Orleans descends into utter anarchy.</p><p>Hurricane Lee, a category five superstorm, blew through Louisiana's shores hard and fast. The weakened state government had already expended its FEMA funds months before it needed help to combat a budget shortfall that now stands penniless when confronted with a catastrophe. As deaths soared and aid remained out of sight, New Orleans quickly fell apart under Jindal's command. After stubbornly refusing help from the President, he eventually gave in, allowing federal troops to flood his state.</p><p>After the storm fled the shore, President Clark was among the first on the ground to inspect the situation alongside Vice President Landrieu. In a scene oddly reminiscent of Lincoln's 1865 tour of war-torn Richmond, the President surveyed the damage. Images circling through the media break hearts nationwide as bodies drift in the flooded streets. The CNN headline New Orleans: Bankrupt, Broken, and Beyond Repair floods news channels. Clark ordered federal troops to go in and take control of the situation. A leaked audio recording of Clark revealed that the President had called Jindal's government "worse than Baghdad." </p><p>The surge of troops is part of a spree of Executive Orders targeting the situation in Louisiana. While Governor Jindal claims the moves are approaching "dictatorial," it is unlikely his say in matters will survive the upcoming 2011 election. Former Senator Mitch Landrieu's polling numbers against the Governor have surged as it seems a loud rebuke of the Brownback manifesto awaits.</p><p>In the present day, Clark has returned to Washington to turn the situation around with a strong disaster relief bill, which he has signed into law.</p><p>Other red-state governors, such as Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who had been considering the Brownback plan, have abandoned such efforts. </p><p>What we can say for sure, however, is that America as a whole dodged an unruly bullet by avoiding electing Brownback in 2008.</p>`)

<p><b>Kansas City (Reuters) - </b>—Republican Sam Brownback lost Tuesday's presidential election at the hands of President Wesley Clark. The establishment Senator turned Tea Party preacher sought the full erratic support of the Republican base to bring a more traditionalist view to the American Government.</p><p>As the blame game began, analysts pointed to one aspect of his campaign: hate. Sam Brownback campaigned on the rage of evangelical Christians, hoping to turn out a large and capable coalition, but his many weaknesses disturbed the moderates within the party. President Clark, by contrast, campaigned to stop hate of all forms, garnering his dedicated following as a result.</p><p>While Brownback's coalition was loyal and dedicated, he lacked support among key groups, especially those most concerned with foreign policy.</p><p>Despite a deeply unpopular Democratic President, a sputtering economy, and a generally tough political environment for Democrats, the Senator failed to convince voters on fundamental issues.</p><p>Brownback's entry into politics was profoundly unrecognizable compared to the way he conducted this campaign. Once an advocate for bipartisanship, Brownback seemingly dropped all compromise within his heart after Clark pushed the Freedom To Marry Act.</p><p>The failure to compromise became Brownback's downfall as his full embrace of populist themes quickly eroded through the patience of establishment Republicans. Radical tax positions, even for a Republican, combined with his extreme views on abortion and dovish foreign policy, limited the range of his coalition.</p><p>In his concession speech, which was followed by a prayer, the Senator noted the massive, glorious movement that enveloped his campaign.</p><p>"I know this loss hangs heavy in our hearts but believe me when I say, we've accomplished more for our Christian faith during this campaign than anyone could have ever imagined." he told his supporters at a somber post-election rally in Kansas City. "I still dream of a day where our deeply religious population aren't held captive by activist governments and that dream is still within reach, we must keep fighting for our children, for our grandchildren and for Christ!"</p><p>Republican strategist John Feehery said Brownback's deeply religious campaign reawakened a populist element within the Republican Party.</p><p>"The crowds he generated weren't just excited, they were frothing for change and praying in unison with him."</p><p>The financial crisis only encouraged the Senator to redouble his efforts on populist talking points like his great tax experiment and massive deregulations.</p><p><b>EASY CLIMATE, TOO RADICAL</b></p><p>Brownback was committed to the idea that the separation between church and state had to be abolished, so much so that he mentioned his Christian faith in every facet of the campaign, from foreign policy to economics.</p><p>He championed himself as a Christian first and a senator second, which quickly gave his campaign a unique and colorful image.</p><p>The financial crisis had blown through President Clark's lead, and most believed Brownback could make a comeback in the same spirit as Bill Clinton in 1992. However, through laser-focused determination and inspiring leadership, President Clark was able to repel Brownback's gains and lead the nation through the crisis convincingly.</p><p>Aides said Brownback's plan for the government cuts, while appealing to a significant portion of his base, worried fiscal hawks, who were unsure how the United States could pay for such extreme tax cuts.</p><p>"It is a great sigh of relief that Senator Brownback's hateful campaign was rejected." - Nancy Parrish, White House Chief of Staff.</p><p>Top Brownback aides say the Senator is jubilant, seemingly believing his strategy was vindicated for coming as close as it did.</p><p>What about Bachmann? To most, Brownback's choice for running mate was initially brave and inspirational but soon became an utter nightmare when her radical tendencies came to the forefront, especially her strange beliefs on bullying and even more dangerous ideas of gutting social security.</p><p>Brownback's campaign manager, Rob Wasinger, defended the campaign's radical stances, claiming they were not out of step with standard Republican ideology.</p><p>"The Republican Party was behind this campaign 100% and we need to acknowledge how close we came to victory," Wasinger told reporters at the Brownback campaign headquarters in Kansas City.

<p>By Jessica Frowigs</p><p>With the 2010 midterm elections looming over Brownback's mandate like a storm, local Iowan petitioners and protesters are demanding Senator Grassley to roll back the "Great American Tax Experiment," which has made its impact on both the minds and wallets of thousands of Iowans statewide. The bill, which made landfall in late 2009 amid an already limping economy wounded from the great recession, has all but helped the Middle and lower classes. </p><p>The Great American Tax Experiment was passed through Congress with the promise of encouraging job growth with radical tax cuts on the super wealthy. Instead, the United States underwent a historic downgrade of its credit rating after budget shortfalls and negotiations over the debt ceiling stalled and left the world holding its breath. Since then, the Democratic Party has seized the narrative, nationalizing local races from top to bottom, with the culmination of Republican worries manifesting under the heel of Senator Chuck Grassley's reelection bid.</p><p>After touring through the state hearing out the woes of everyday Iowans, former Governor Tom Vilsack threw his hat into the ring to challenge Grassley, believing the entrenched Senator had lost his touch with Iowa folk. Collecting a coalition of aching teamster representatives, working families unable to afford their groceries, and farmers denied access to Healthcare after Medicaid and Medicare cuts sliced through the national budget, Vilsack currently polls just behind Grassley, stepping on his heels. </p><p>The movement to repudiate the Brownback agenda isn't just a Democratic play for power; moderate Republicans in swing districts have begun to draw up their amendment to the bill, hoping to pull back the political tiger clawing at their reelection efforts. Income taxes would go up, and millions of homeowners nationwide would pay taxes again to avoid any more budget shortfalls shortly, but for Democrats, it isn't a compromise; they want to tear Brownback apart.

<p><b>Houston (Reuters) - </b>Republican Dick Cheney lost Tuesday's presidential election burdened by chaos at the hands of President Wesley Clark. The former Vice President, who had a habit of making a villain out of those who opposed them, fell short of the widely expected routing of Wesley Clark.</p><p>As the blame game began, analysts came to a multitude of conclusions. The controversial convention nomination, Huckabee supporters staying home, an uncharismatic campaign, and his unpopularity were all floated possibilities. President Clark dutifully exploited this and made the election a referendum on the decisions made by the "Cheney White House" 4 years prior.</p><p>Cheney's attempts to portray Clark as a failure in foreign affairs failed to turn heads meaningfully. He often found himself the lone voice shouting to the heavens.</p><p>Despite a deeply unpopular Democratic President, a sputtering economy, and a generally tough political environment for Democrats, the Vice President collapsed under the weight of his own failings.</p><p>If you had asked anyone at George W. Bush's 2004 election night rally if Republicans would nominate his unpopular number 2, most would have laughed in your face.</p><p>What Cheney failed to provide was a popular agenda to justify why he had to rip the nomination from Huckabee's hands essentially. Running on a platform of vindication would only carry him so far and proved not to get the voters out into booths for him.</p><p>In a cold concession speech, the Vice President reflected on his campaign accepting fault, but like many who voted against him, the crowd felt his apology was disingenuous.</p><p>"Clearly, the American people have made their decision, and the numbers aren't in our favor," he told his supporters at a somber post-election rally in Houston. I'm sorry that they failed to understand the gravity of what is at stake, and I pray that the president understands the mandate given to him." </p><p>Republican strategist John Feehery said that when presented with the actions of the Bush administration, the American people rebuked them.</p><p>"The general public is not willing to go back to what they already voted against once. Hoping for Bush to be vindicated was a losing strategy for Republicans."</p><p>The financial crisis that erupted in September had given Republicans confidence that even if Cheney had not earned the nomination fairly, he would be elected via Clark's sheer incompetence.</p><p><b>EASY CLIMATE, WRONG CANDIDATE </b></p><p>Polls after the convention projected that if Governor Mike Huckabee had won the nomination, he'd have led Clark by a comfortable margin. Other polls for candidates such as Senator John McCain and Governor Mitt Romney concluded a similar outcome. </p><p>Governor Huckabee, who went into the Republican National Convention, was widely expected to be the party's nominee until party insiders worked to find a better consensus candidate. After four ballots, Cheney became their pick.</p><p>The financial crisis also put Cheney's government experience under speculation. While President Clark came off as calm and firm in his response, the Vice President came off as cold and uncaring for families hurting from the crisis.</p><p>Clark's aides claim that Cheney was doomed to lose from the beginning and that the circumstances he squandered were enormous.</p><p>"It is highly doubtful that anyone will ever have an easier and more advantaged political climate than Dick Cheney was given." - Nancy Parrish, White House Chief of Staff.</p><p>Top Cheney aides claim that the Huckabee camp is to blame for not helping the Republican ticket get across the finish line.</p><p>What about Snowe? To most, Cheney's pick for Vice President failed to bring out enough independents to make her selection worthwhile and alienated Huckabee supporters who hoped to be thrown a bone. </p><p>Cheney Senior Advisor John Bolten concluded that Republican Party extremists dropped the ball.</p><p>"The Republican Party needs to back away from extremist elements within the party and put forward responsible and feasible platforms," Bolten told reporters at the Cheney campaign headquarters in Houston. "The Vice President ran a campaign for all Americans, those Republicans who stayed home should be ashamed of themselves."</p><p>Editing by Alan Elsner</p><p>Our Standards: <br>The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</br></p>`)

Nicholas Slatten, Paul Slough, Evan Liberty, and Dustin Heard were the men most harshly criticized by both Iraqi officials and the UN, and a case that could have been brought against them for their part in the massacre has been thrown out the window.</p><p>The move was harshly criticized by the UN, which issued a statement claiming that Cheney's actions "violate U.S. obligations under international law and more broadly undermine humanitarian law and human rights at a global level".</p><p>"Justice was served on the battlefield; no courtroom should be allowed to determine the fates of Americans who did their job, " said Cheney during an Oval Office press briefing.

<p><b>By Seumas Milne, The Guardian, December 21, 2008</b></p><p>It's now beyond the shadow of a doubt that the August war, which could have come to an end that same month, was not a spontaneous eruption but a calculation.  A report by Tim Whewell, which aired on Newsnight and on Radio 4's File on Four, found strong evidence confirming that western-backed Georgia was the aggressor on the night of August 7. It also assembles powerful testimony of wide-ranging war crimes carried out by the Georgian army in its attack on the contested region of South Ossetia. </p><p>Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili was directly encouraged by American President Wesley Clark to attack South Ossetian separatists, which would force Russia's hand. For those not informed about Clark's record, this is the same man who ordered British forces to attack Russian soldiers at Prestina Airport while Supreme Allied Commander of NATO—an order which was both defied and publicly admonished for nearly taking another regional conflict worldwide.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was no General Jackson able to tell the American president "no" and avoid setting off World War III. By pressuring Saakashvili, who already has a record of eccentricity and foolhardiness, Clark got the result he wanted—turning what should have been a two-week skirmish into months of bloody fighting to be called off with his genius plan to bomb the Roki Tunnel.</p><p>Russia's reaction was, of course, furious; not only did any attempt at closing the war with a ceasefire get tossed, but now the American air force trapped thousands of Russian soldiers without a way out and blocked off from reinforcements. No state would ever tolerate such a move, yet Clark's cheerleaders claim it's Russia's responsibility to seek an end to the war.</p><p>The fact of the matter is that NATO has slowly encircled Russia for years, with decreasing justification with each state added to the defensive alliance. In no way should Wesley Clark have encouraged Georgia's admission into NATO. He has single-handedly tarnished his beloved alliance's credibility.</p><p>By contrast, the efforts of Nicholas Sarkozy to broker a ceasefire should be hailed as a valuable asset to the world. Whatever you think of his domestic record, Sarkozy has worked around the clock to steer Clark's sinking ship. The real test, however, will depend on Sarkozy's ability to assert himself and pull the Americans’ leash.</p><p>The alternative is a return to the dark ages. All because Americans elected the single worst human being capable of handling regional clashes. This war falls on Clark's shoulders, as does the climbing death toll along with it.</p>`)

<p><b>Description:</b></p><p>In this searing, behind the scenes political memoir, former Vice President Mary Landrieu offers a candid, unflinching account of her turbulent years in the White House under President Wesley Clark (2005–2009). A presidency marked by bold ambitions, political missteps, and ultimately, electoral defeat.</p><p>As the first female Vice President from the Deep South, Landrieu entered the West Wing hoping to bridge the growing divide between progressive ideals and pragmatic governance. Instead, she found herself increasingly at odds with a president whose bold, but politically tone deaf agenda left middle America behind. From divisive social policy experiments to aggressive environmental shifts that alienated energy dependent states, Landrieu chronicles her growing disillusionment with an administration that, in her view, governed too far outside the mainstream.</p><p>With firsthand insights, private Oval Office conversations, and previously unreleased correspondence, Against the Current unpacks:<b>:</b></p><p><b>The internal clashes over Clark’s rapid push for military and social reforms.</b></p><p><b>The political cost of ignoring moderate and working class voters.</b></p><p><b>How Katrina, healthcare reform, and rural energy policy became fault lines in the administration.</b></p><p><b>The mounting tensions between Landrieu and Clark as the 2008 election approached.</b></p><p><b>Why their campaign collapsed under the weight of idealism unmoored from political reality.</b></p><p>A rare and honest reflection from inside the highest levels of American government, this book is both a cautionary tale and a call to action for leaders who hope to build durable coalitions in a divided nation. Whether you’re a political junkie, a historian, or a disenchanted centrist, Against the Current is a must read look at what happens when vision collides with governance and when a Vice President says, “Enough.”</p>`)

<p><b>By Jessica Que || May 19, 2010</b></p><p>The Arkansas Democratic Party appears to be the most pessimistic state party in the nation, despite serving the American people two of its last Democratic presidents in the past two decades. Despite its national success, the undeniable reality is that every election cycle, the state's population grows more conservative, contrary to the national Party's agenda. With Wesley Clark's failure to secure a second term two years ago, the Democratic Party's base, even in Arkansas, has only grown more rageful for what they see as "the establishment."</p><p>Meanwhile, the often-considered most vulnerable incumbent Senator for the 2010 election cycle, Blanche Lincoln, made herself an opponent of progressivism. A self-described blue dog Democrat, Lincoln stands at the gates of progress alongside Republican colleagues, shouting down any attempt at fiscally ambiguous legislation.</p><p>The biggest stain on Senator Lincoln's reputation, however, lies with her steadfast support for Wesley Clark in the 2004 Democratic primaries. With Clark's defeat leaving a poor taste in the average American's mouth, much of the political failures he faced now fall on Lincoln's reputation, as do those of many others who stood by his policies. The electoral elixir procured has bubbled a strong primary challenge to unseat Lincoln. </p><p>Cue the lights and cameras for Lieutenant Governor Bill Halter's entrance into the 2010 Arkansas Senate election. Disobeying the commands of Democratic leadership, Halter charged into the primary with aggressive populist messaging that beat and battered the incumbent Senator. When Senator Lincoln came in second in the first round, over three points behind Halter, establishment worries over keeping the seat grew ever more apparent. Multiple high-profile Democrats confronted Halter, hoping to persuade him to drop out of the race of preserve the seat. Halter remained unmoved by their plea and continued into the second round unburdened by the concerns that he could not last in the increasingly red environment Arkansas has become. </p><p>When all votes were tallied, Halter would prevail in the second round 54% to Lincoln's 46% effectively ending her political career. At a primary night rally, Halter declared, "The people of Arkansas have spoken, we are tired of business as usual, we want progress!" Despite the Halter campaign's optimism, polls show him trailing Boozman anywhere from 10 to 20 points in the general election. </p><p>Some pundits argue that this is all by design, not as an effort to win the election truly, but to send a message to the Democratic establishment. Business as usual is no longer enough to satisfy them about the American people. Only time will tell if Halter's message means enough to the people of Arkansas.</p>`)

<p><b>Documentary – 1h 52m</b></p><p><b>Director: Michael Moore</b></p><p><b>Writer: Michael Moore</b></p><p><b>Plot Summary</b></p><p>Academy Award-winning filmmaker Michael Moore examines how the Democratic Party, desperate to defeat George W. Bush, turned to a man both ideologically and skillfully unfit to serve as president, donning their banner. By rallying behind General Wesley K. Clark, the Democrats set themselves on a path of both underachievement and disappointment.</p><p>Moore argues that the Democrats failed to respond to the Bush administration's ruthless policies with a bold platform rebuking the worst elements of their administration. Through nominating Wesley Clark, the party of liberalism got its wish of defeating President Bush at all costs, even at the price of sacrificing nearly all of their ideological credibility.</p><p>Using his signature humor and aggressive journalistic appeal, Moore highlights the dozens of Compromises made over foreign policy and domestic issues, trading vision for electability, and ultimately sealing the party's fate in November 2008.</p><p><b>Tagline</b></p><p>"They won the battle by choosing General Clark but lost the war at the same time."</p><p><b>Quotes:</b></p><p>"It was a shortsighted decision but if you put me in a room with Wesley Clark and Dennis Kucinich I'd endorse Clark again every day."</p><p>"Clark was the perfect man for the moment except nobody thought of the repercussions for him sticking around past that time."</p><p>"I was willing to overlook that he voted for Nixon when I was running for president because I believed people could change."</p><p><b>User Reviews:</b></p><p><b>★★★☆☆ – "Moore's hypocritical grandstanding isn't all that bad"</b></p><p><b>by BlueDogDem87</b></p><p>Moore understands the issue of electability politics very well, but forgets that HE ENDORSED CLARK FOR THE EXACT SAME REASON!

e.pages.push(`<h3>From gamesradar.net : <i>Former President Welsey Clark sues Georgian developer after likeness and voice clips used without permission</i></h3>
<p>In a court filing obtained by reporters, former President Wesley Clark is suing Georgian game developer, Grulk Games, alleging that the developers used his likeness and voice lines from the President’s address to Congress about the Russian Invasion of Georgia without permission in their 2009 game, S.T.U.M.B.:Shadow of the Wastezone. The studio maintains that any clips used fall under the fair use clause of the Copyright Act, and therefore they were not legally obligated to obtain express permission from the former President, while disputing the claim they used the President’s likeness.
After his 2008 loss, President Clark was abandoned by the Democratic Party after political consultants and pundits blamed the Russian aggression on Clark’s inflammatory relationship with Vladimir Putin. In a recent interview, 2004 Democratic primary candidate and Clark’s Secretary of State, John Kerry, told ABC that he “would’ve handled things more diplomatically” had he been in the President’s position. Former Vice President Mary Landrieu recently launched her bid to unseat Republican Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and in her speech, she separated herself dramatically from the former President, disavowing his actions in regards to Russia.</p><p>The game is inspired by the real life Russian bombing of the Roki Tunnel, except in game, a nuclear device was used, leaving a radioactive wasteland behind, full of mutated humans and animals. The voice lines in question are present in the intro of the game, overheard on a radio with Clark declaring “The time to act is now” and “Only we are strong enough to stop the Menace”. There are also newspaper clippings in games that display a picture that Clark alleges is a likeness of himself. Grulk Games denies that the newspaper clipping was inspired by Clark, saying that they created a “generic American general” to use in game.</p><p>The controversy has sparked debate in both political and legal circles. Legal experts are skeptical of Clark’s chances in court, but gaming fans have taken a lighter tone, turning the case into a joke. Fans of the game have gone through Clark’s older speeches, clipping chunks to create humorous phrases such as “We need to resist Russian- Madonna concerts.”, while other fans have remixed Clark’s speeches into parody songs, mocking the former president.</p><p>For Grulk Games, the publicity has been priceless. S.T.U.M.B. sales have skyrocketed since news of the case broke on gaming forums across the internet. Data from the games studio show that 56% of new purchases have come from the United States, in a clear rebuke to Clark’s legacy. US-based modder, Xx_HellfireMenace_xX, released a mod that changes the player model to a likeness of the former president and received over 3,000 downloads within 48 hours of release, spiting the President’s claim that his likeness was used. Rumors have begun to spread that Grulk Games is starting development on a potential sequel, with one developer joking on Twitter that if they did make a sequel it would “include only original voice lines”.</p><p>As the lawsuit makes its way through the courts, it seems General Clark has earned another badge: laughingstock of the internet.</p>`)

</p><p><b>Air Date: </b>August 10, 2009</p><p><b>Host: </b>Anderson Cooper</p><p><b>Guest: </b>Rahm Emanuel, Former Congressman and Democratic Strategist</p><p><b>Anderson Cooper:</b></p><p>Former Congressman Rahm Emanuel, one of the Democratic Party's sharpest political strategists, will join us tonight. It's good to have you here, Rahm.</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p>Thanks, Anderson. Good to be with you.</p><p><b>Anderson Cooper:</b></p><p>So, the dust has settled, and I think we have had enough time to analyze what went wrong last year, but I'd love to know where you think the Democrats failed. Why did Clark lose?</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p>Look, Anderson, elections are about contrast and confidence. Voters faced two major conflicts, one at home and the other abroad. Clark ran an administration filled with ambition, passing bold ideas without caring about the political ramifications of such legislation. Labels mean a lot in this business, and the President getting stuck with the word "radical" on his forehead hurt the team. That scared a lot of voters in the middle.</p><p><b>Anderson Cooper:</b></p><p>Clark often justified his momentum based strategy by arguing that the base would be hardened and remain committed to the Democrats as long as things were getting done. Why do you think that failed?</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p>It's pretty simple. People like consistency; they want to feel secure. Clark often attacked the system that elected him and thus was rejected because people felt scared. He had a legislative freight train built, and instead of saying "all aboard," he tied parts of the Democratic coalition on the railroad and ran right over them. It came off as ideological overreach rather than pragmatic leadership.</p><p><b>Anderson Cooper:</b></p><p>Wasn't Clark trying to seize a moment of transformation after the Bush years?</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p>Of course, he was, and that's a noble mission, but transforming the system doesn't mean you need to burn it to the ground. The President needs to work through the system, build trust, and build alliances. Clark was a general; he led troops and the country, but politics required more chess and less blitzkrieg.</p><p><b>Anderson Cooper:</b></p><p>Some argue that the base wanted that sweeping change. Clark was answering a demand from the left.</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p>That's exactly right and exactly what went wrong. Yes, the base was fired up, and we watched the DNC shout "Go Wes Go" altogether, but a healthy coalition is more than your core supporters. You need to reach out to independents, moderates, and even across the aisle. You have to govern in prose, not poetry. Clark offered a manifesto, not a strategy.</p><p><b>Anderson Cooper:</b></p><p>So, is this a rejection of progressive ideas?</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p>Not entirely. It's a rejection of how they were sold. You want to reform the financial system? Sure, but you need to go at it carefully. You can't take an axe to a tree that reigns over your home. Republicans were given an easy message to run with: "Big government. Big taxes. Big risk."</p><p><b>Anderson Cooper:</b></p><p><b>Final question: </b>What lesson should Democrats take into 2012?</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b><p>Discipline, sequencing, humility. The country doesn't want revolution; it wants stability. The Clinton years may seem like a long time ago, but they were a successful eight years that merely had one hiccup in 2000. That won't happen again. Democrats need to provide continuity to move back to where the voters are, not where Clark wished they were.</p><p><b>Anderson Cooper:</b></p><p>Always candid; thank you for your time.</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p>Thank you, Anderson.</p>`)

Rahm, thanks for being here.</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p>Thanks, Anderson. It's always a pleasure.</p><p><b>Anderson Cooper:</b></p><p>Let's jump straight to it. President Clark ran an overly cautious and risk averse campaign, hugging establishment norms and presenting himself as Bush without the baggage. Losing what many felt was a turnout election. What did you feel on the ground?</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p>Let's be clear: This was a wartime election. Financial institutions and the stock markets had begun to wither and decay before either party held its convention. We made the smart calculation that the American people were looking for calm, collected, and confident leadership able to steady the ship.</p><p><b>Anderson Cooper:</b></p><p>But it didn't land. Voters didn't buy it. Republicans, Democrats, and independents entered the voting booths, hoping for change.</p> <p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p>There's a difference between misreading the moment and respecting it. Republicans can promise the moon; Democrats explain how we will govern responsibly. It wasn't sexy, but it was serious, we offered maturity, respect for the institutions, and the character of our people that was on the line. It might have cost us flashy aesthetics, but it was not bad judgment.</p><p><b>Anderson Cooper:</b></p><p>You say that, but internal memos, including one you allegedly authored, limited Clark's range. Instead of allowing the President to expand on bolder ideas that polled well even within swing states, you handed him a script with limited talking points.</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p>Governing isn't about pie in the sky promises; it's about building a machine able to win elections long term and creating a coalition that can reach independents and even those across the aisle.</p><p><b>Anderson Cooper:</b></p><p>But you didn't win. You lost.

The rising tides of challenges we faced would make anyone consider a laundry list of proposals, believe me.

You helped shape a message that effectively failed to impress voters. How much farther can you compromise?</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p>Alright, no. You are looking for a scapegoat, and I'm not your guy. We played the best cards we could on hand, and I'm proud of the campaign we ran. We did what we thought was right.</p><p><b>Anderson Cooper:</b></p><p>Even if that means you lost?</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p>Sometimes, leadership is learning to lose the right way.</p><p><b>Anderson Cooper:</b></p><p>Or just losing.</p><p><b>Rahm Emanuel:</b></p><p><b>[Removes mic] </b>We're done here.</p>`)

<p><b>Draft Clark 2012?</b> Voters on the ground pass, but primary polling remains leading other major candidates.</p><p>As polling for the 2012 election mulls over in the minds of many voters in key states like Iowa and New Hampshire, the Democratic Party is grappling with the reality that if the former president were to run again, he'd likely win both contests. Iowa and New Hampshire were the key states that propelled Clark from a tight race with then-Senator John Kerry to stardom, painting the broader national race with his name. While other candidates build their national profile with rigorous whistle-stop tours through the states, the faint chanting of "Go Wes Go" remains in the background.</p><p>In 2008, when most polls indicated that Clark was to be swept up in a red tsunami amid the global recession, the president had rallied his party and presented a solid front to his record and ability to combat the crisis. In a polling upset, Clark outperformed expectations widely by 6-8 points nationally. While Republicans won the day, nonetheless, Democrats find it hard not to reward and commend the effort that effectively saved many of their careers, taking shelter under his name on the ballot.</p><p>When asked if he was thinking of running again, the former president claimed, "I don't like to make commitments to conflicts unless I know I'm needed." He declined to comment on the possibility of a run any further, and many suspect he's planning to sit this one out. The president stayed busy growing his business affairs, writing books, and running his cybersecurity tech firm, Clark & Co Cyberspace Protections. </p><p>Known candidates, such as Hillary Clinton, seemingly remain deathly afraid of the possibility of a Wesley Clark 2012 campaign. Former President Bill Clinton allegedly confronted Clark, asking him to stay out of the way. The often stubborn general, who had turned president, reportedly seemed annoyed while leaving his home in Chicago, Illinois.</p><p>If Clark were to jump into the race, he'd become the first former president to throw his hat into the ring of a presidential election since Herbert Hoover. Republicans often draw a connection between him and Hoover to drive home the point that the recession was a "Democrats fault." The messaging, however, proved unimpressive after the 2010 midterms, which saw Republicans undergo a severe lashing on every level of government. So, although Clark ranks 4th or 5th in national polling among Democratic candidates against the Republicans, he remains in the top 3 in the first 5 Democratic contests. The door is open to a Wesley Clark comeback to sweep the nation. It depends on whether the people of Iowa and New Hampshire are so forgiving.</p>`)

<p><b>Posted by u/TVHistoryNerd420 – July 14, 2013</b></p><p>Okay, so I went through the early production footage of Breaking Bad Season 1 and found a bit of Vince Gilligan discussing a lot of the pre-production drama and script changes.</p><p>Vince Gilligan's original 2006 pilot script had Walter White's life upended by a cancer diagnosis, and through his struggle to pay for various treatment options, he resorts to becoming a meth kingpin, Heisenberg. The show was initially supposed to display themes that critiqued the American health system and how it could turn such a mild-mannered chemistry teacher into a monster. </p><p>However, by the time Breaking Bad was greenlit for production, President Wesley Clark had passed ClarkCare, which effectively killed the themes' relatability. You can't have a show about a dying man who can't afford to pay to live when the government is willing to do that now.</p><p>So Gilligan pivoted fast to what we know.</p><p>"What if the DEA guy was Walter's corrupt brother in law who forced him to cook meth for his own drug empire."</p><p>The show's themes would be reflected in how the government seeks to profit from crime while claiming to crack down on it. Think Reagan doing all that war on drugs nonsense while funneling crack into black communities.</p><p>From what I read, many of the themes would chase the current headlines; the government corruption in the show followed scandals in the Clark administration. The new Walter White would become a victim of his brother, whereas the original was meant to be the result of an individual's ego and narcissistic behaviors, driven by the pursuit of wealth and glory.</p><p>Honestly, the Hank is Heisenberg twist at the end of Season 1, as the show concluded its "who done it" mystery over who exactly was Heisenberg, had me excited as fuck. The rewrite saved the show, frankly.</p><p><b>Top Comments:</b></p><p><b>u/Neo90s:</b></p><p>> Wow, I guess I have one thing to thank socialism for. A good TV show!</p><p><b>u/SkylerDesep:</b></p><p>> Wait, so does Jesse still die at the end of Season 1 in the original?</p><p><b>u/Hero69:</b></p><p>> Should have just called it Breaking Bureaucracy </p>`)

<p>Scathing leaks from Secret Service logs allege that President Clark bought the endorsement of Madonna in the weeks leading up to what would become President Clark's upset victory amid a total economic meltdown. What was most surprising was the emergence of singer Madonna back onto the political stage, metaphorically and literally. In one of the president's final campaign rallies, he held a concert with Madonna, stoking up a last-minute boost of excitement and possibly swaying the election in his favor. Years later, leaked Secret Service logs show that perhaps foul play was involved to pull Madonna into the race.

<p>My fellow Americans, friends, and family, we come together to mourn the passing of a great man, George McGovern. Grown from the Wheat fields of South Dakota to later be hailed in the halls of Congress. From the cockpit of a bomber to the quiet dignity of a statesman's twilight years.</p><p>George McGovern was a decorated war hero, an advocate for peace, a crusader against hunger, and a voice for the voiceless. Most of all, he was a man of conscience. In the world we live in, that's a rare medal of prestige.</p><p>I first came to admire George McGovern for his unwavering belief that America is best guided by compassion and justice. He saw no contradiction in being both a warrior and a peacemaker. Having fought bravely in World War 2, he knew the cost of the wars we fought and always acted to prevent them.</p><p>When he ran in the 1972 election, he was always underestimated by his peers. While I would still cast my vote for President Nixon, I could not doubt that America would be in safe hands with his leadership. He fought the good fight for a divided nation and made his mark by not shying away from his moral compass.</p><p>George and I shared a bond through military service, and I looked up to his bravery, as did respect for mine. We shared the belief that patriotism is not measured by how loudly you shout, but by how deeply you care for truth and justice.</p><p>Today, as we lay this good man to rest, let us not remember George McGovern for what he did but for what he stood for. His legacy stood not for nativity but idealism, which works to make a better America stand firm.</p><p>Thank you, Senator. God bless you, and may you rest in peace.</p>`)

e.pages.push(`<h3>AP: <i>President Wesley K. Clark Defies Supreme Court Ruling on Foreclosure Moratorium Extension</i></h3>
<p><b>April 10, 2008 — Washington, D.C.</b></p><p>Executive-judicial tensions that had built up over the past weeks have now boiled over following the President's rebuke of the recent Supreme Court ruling on his extension of the nationwide foreclosure moratorium. The Court's finding that his executive order was, in fact, unconstitutional sparked Wesley Clark's escalation into a constitutional crisis that neither congressional Democrats nor Republicans seemed interested in interfering with.</p><p>President Clark, reelected in November 2008 on the strength of his administration's response to the recession, had initially been issued the moratorium weeks before the election at the height of the housing crisis. When presenting his wide-ranging bailout initiative, he regarded the bill as "the failsafe to save America." While the original moratorium, enacted with congressional support, was set to expire in November 2009, Clark's recent unilateral extension via executive order was struck down in a 5-4 ruling by the Supreme Court, citing separation of powers and a lack of legislative authority.</p><p>Almost as if the President was quoting Andrew Jackson himself, Clark responded to the ruling at a Monday press briefing, "The Court has made its opinion known, and so have I. I'd like to see them enforce it. I answer to America, not a political bench held by echoes of a bygone era."</p><p>The White House continues to argue that the President holds unilateral authority, citing that the American economy is beginning to affect foreign policy. White House Chief of Staff commented, saying, "We are choosing stability over procedure, and for the President to effectively manage the country's foreign policy, we need a stable home front.</p><p>Legal scholars are deeply divided on the events, arguing that the President's actions risk setting a precedent that could destroy judicial authority for years to come. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, a former Harvard president, is noticeably quiet on the issue, simply carrying out the President's directives.</p><p>Yet the President's approval ratings continue to surge, particularly among working-class and minority groups still recovering from the financial crash. Recent Gallup polls show that the approval of the moratorium has risen to 68%, while approval of Clark's recent actions lags not far behind at 59%.</p><p>Republican congressional leaders remain paralyzed following a failure to launch an impeachment inquiry over the President's actions. House Republican Leader Eric Cantor has quietly pulled the effort following a private conference proving unable to secure enough votes within his ranks.</p><p>Private sources say that several GOP House members are afraid to be seen siding with banks over the people. An undisclosed Congressman stated, "We're looking down the scope of complicated numbers for the midterms and Clark continues to surprise us, so it's best if we just ride this one out."</p><p>Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has declined to issue further comments. Legal observers note that the judiciary lacks the cards to wage a war on the executive. The U.S. Marshal Service, responsible for enforcing the Court's decisions, remains under the control of the Justice Department, which the President has a firm hand on.</p><p>As the branches of government prepare for a first shot, what remains clear is that the moratorium on foreclosures will stay in place following the President's political gamble, which redraws the lines of Executive Power.</p>`)

<p><b>Politics | August 17, 2009</b></p> <p>President Wesley Clark, who won reelection last November by nothing short of a mistake from God, has now dropped the bipartisan mask and has become what we all knew he was: a full-fledged dictator. In a move that even blindsided his corrupt democrat buddies, he revealed himself to be the untrustworthy socialist Republicans have been warning about.</p> <p>If you put him in his military uniform and get him on a balcony, you will see a dictator. Republicans in Congress need to move to impeach this sociopathic pathological liar before he convinces his party to go forward with dismantling America!</p><p>The reasoning the President brought up was nothing more but utter fear-mongering; "No child in this country should grow up without regular medical checkups and care or regular exercise and physical fitness training and every adult should be provided access to the kind of diagnostic testing and preventive treatments which can slow the onset of aging diseases like diabetes or alzheimers."</p><p>The United States has the single best healthcare system in the world. You need to work hard for it, but the reward is impossible to beat. President Clark's proposal will not only lower the quality of our healthcare, but it will also shatter our economy, and in 10 years, America will be a third world country.</p><p>He brought up his supposed "studies," which, I assure you, are nothing but the word of Marx. President Clark remarked, "In my study of this problem and experience over the years, this means transforming gradually, systematically from a workplace centered private payer system toward some greater reliance on some form of a single-payer system to ease administrative burdens and reduce cost!"</p> <p>He's a liar; every single economist will tell you that healthcare to the extreme he wants will explode prices and require every American to give even more to the government, and we'll get tiny in return!</p> <p>Republicans and Democrats need to step up and dismantle the Clark Regime, but I doubt many of the Democratic Party are willing to stand up against their king given that they passed the stepping stone, Clark Care. America's fall to socialism is nothing short of a nightmare, but there is still hope.

These Senators took a knife and stabbed us in the back for nothing in return.</p><p>President Clark already breached the trust going after our guns by sunsetting much of the progress Bush made unraveling the Clinton years' draconian laws.

Amid Republicans' drastic and humiliating defeat during the 2008 election, he sought to make history while ruling by near royal decree. He has gone for more regulation, more stops, and more tyranny. All while the Republican Party allows him to, he's gone mad, I tell you!</p><p>If Republicans want to slay the dragon of the Democratic Party, they need to get tough on the issues and abandon the party establishment! This party looks down the scope of uncertainty as we sail through rivers of defeat! A true conservative agenda cannot be hitched to the idea of handing out goodwill and freebies!</p> <p>I was once a Democrat, and during my time, I realized how long gone the party had become. No longer a party of pragmatism, I and many Louisianians witnessed the rapid decline of the party's sensibilities. If we allow Republicans to forget the people they represent, they will surely follow in their footsteps and fall far from the American people's positions on key issues.</p><p>That's why I am running for President: to save America from the President's radical agenda and enact sustainable change in the Republican Party. The midterms are fast approaching, and incumbents all across the country should fear for their positions, Republican and Democratic. It's an opportunity for a true American rebirth, only if Republicans are willing to allow change to come to Washington.</p>`)

<p><b>Jill Villy - May 18, 2010</b></p><p>Nobody likes hearing the phrase "I told you so," especially in a political context, but after the weeks of pandemonium over the President's "refurbished social security" rollout, the phrase holds a lot of weight. The long-awaited social security reform package, passed in 2007, finally rolled out to a rocky reception on Tuesday, as millions of Americans found that they no longer had access to their social security benefits.</p><p>A White House event meant to celebrate the fiscal stability of Social Security for the 21st century was upended when a series of chaotic and concerned press questions soured the President's mood as he heard that millions of Americans were experiencing account lockouts. </p><p>"Mr. President stations nationwide have begun to report widespread discontent with the new website for Social Security claiming their access has been denied along with other digital glitches, how do you respond?"</p><p>Clark, appearing visibly stunned and caught like a deer in headlights, fumbled through his papers, responding, "I've been informed of several digital bugs, but these are temporary. I assure you that no one has lost access to their social security benefits."</p><p>Another reporter chimed in, saying, "According to the bill itself, a raise in the retirement age is due to take place eventually, is this a sign of what's to come?"</p><p>Clark began passively messaging his temple before stating, "No, the retirement age will not be raised, and this is just a glitch in our system there is nothing to fret about."</p><p>The room was soon consumed by a frenzy of reporters asking for further comments, but the President made his exit amid the chaos. Not even Clark has the answers to this conundrum, as White House Chief of Staff Terry McAuliffe has made the following statement.</p><p>"The president understands the concerns of those eligible for social security benefits without access to their accounts and is working around the clock to fix this malfunction."</p><p>Republicans who once championed the bill have now turned against it entirely, as midterm campaigning begins to take hold of a new and unfamiliar message for the Grand Old Party. "Save Social Security," once a Democratic slogan, has become the Republicans' warhorse to capitalize on the moment of weakness in the Democrats' natural home turf.</p><p>The immediate fallout suggests that the American people haven't just grown tired of the President, but they utterly loathe him.</p>`)

<p>While the Republican establishment nationwide faces upset losses in primaries, so does Wesley Clark's vision for a bipartisan Democratic Party.</p><p>It's no surprise that progressives have identified the key race in the state of Pennsylvania as a make-or-break moment for a movement constantly overshadowed by establishment interests. The insult that Arlen Specter, a longtime Republican and now Democrat, but for dubious reasons at best, is now forced on Democratic primary voters because the establishment voices believe "only he can win."</p><p>Joe Sestak is a longtime Democrat who has effectively positioned himself as what Democrats should be: a representation of moving forward socially and economically. While Vice President Mary Landrieu hits the trail harder for a Republican friend, Joe Sestak is in Philadelphia raising grassroots cash and support to counterbalance the Republican efforts. His candidacy, however, couldn't have been further galvanized than Clark's hot mic gaffe telling Specter to "destroy the moron," lighting the race on fire.</p><p>The race has served as a symbol of the long-time battle between progress and hesitation. Progressive stalwarts have put all their eggs on winning Sestak the primary as a way to rebuke Clark's betrayals. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, in particular, has become a force to be reckoned with in raising money for the Sestak campaign. He, too, has joined the effort of rebuking the president's centrist, appealing approach. </p><p>Specter's frustration with the situation is reportedly immense as he feels the establishment isn't doing enough to stop this. The Republican-turned-Democrat chose to switch parties to avoid a long primary slugfest with Republican grassroots, but is now looking to be squashed by the left instead, with Sestak pumping out ads scoring his record of Senate votes for Clarence Thomas and other legislation reviled by the left.</p><p>Regardless of the outcome, this race may serve as a warning shot of what's to come for the Democratic Party if they continue to fight their voters more than the Republicans.</p>`)

<p><b>By Alex Murphy</b></p><p>Longtime ally and friend to President Wesley Clark, Bill Richardson has found himself embroiled in a federal investigation into how his political donors, who contributed to his various campaigns for governor, landed a high-value transportation contract. This comes as the governor hopes to have his nomination for Secretary of Commerce confirmed by the Senate.</p><p>Clark has made no secret of his friendship and loyalty to Richardson amid the scathing investigation and has given his party the "go ahead" to confirm Richardson. This is despite the bipartisan league of Senators wanting nothing more than to deny Richardson access to such an important post in times of economic uncertainty. The President has barked orders to both his party and the other side of the aisle, fighting tooth and nail to save the nomination of a "loyal soldier."</p><p>Richardson, once hailed as a valuable member of the Clinton administration and a skilled diplomat and negotiator, sees his record's importance wane by the minute as the federal investigation into his private dealings threatens to prolong a lengthy process. </p><p>What's worse is the President's willingness to ignore the risk of allowing a man currently under suspicion of handing out favorable contracts to control of a department where he will continue to negotiate with corporations. "Richardson is innocent and I'm not willing to discard a uniquely qualified man or allegations that are not true," Clark said during a press briefing.</p><p>However, not even the President's strongest supporters can keep the line steady, as Top Democrat Tom Daschle failed to silence the opinion of Montana Senator Max Baucus, who labeled Richardson's nomination a "sinking ship."</p><p>Republicans easily positioned themselves as the voice of reason, with Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn calling Clark's advocacy for Richardson "cronyism in the open." "The American people will not stand for a Commerce Secretary whose commitments are in the dark."</p><p>The outcome of such a political scandal will set the tone for Clark's second term. And whether Democrats succeed in elevating a corruption magnate or not, that tone will remain cynical and disillusioned.</p>`)

<p><b>Dallas, TX, August 27, 2009</b></p><p>After his shadowy exit from the political scene, former President George W. Bush delivered his first strong denunciation of the Clark administration's agenda since leaving office, criticizing the final sunset of many of the core tenets of the Patriot Act.</p><p>Bush served a single term, introduced by the widely controversial Supreme Court decision Bush v. Gore, and then overshadowed by the 9/11 attacks and the unpopular war in Iraq. Beaten by a political novice and former Republican, Wesley Clark charged into the political frontlines with the same light-speed momentum that saw him sweep the Democratic primaries and shocked the political spectrum. According to Karl Rove, Bush's campaign manager, the night "first there was the polling error that showed Clark 20 points ahead in Alabama, that really shook us, and the feeling never got better."</p><p>Last night, however, Bush seemed to have shaken off the cloak of defeat that shrouded his legacy and spoke to the frustrations that he and many conservatives feel with President Clark's decision to sunset and do away with the leftovers of the last gutting of their beloved Patriot Act. At the unveiling of the George W. Bush Presidential Library, he made the following remarks: "The President's decision not only weakens American security but hurts our national sense of pride and unity."</p><p>He went on to deliver a tribute to these sentiments by saying, "The Patriot Act was never about politics, it was the response to a national tragedy and a promise that we would do better!" With emotion in his voice, he raised the concerns that many Americans have about the President's efforts to dismantle his predecessor's achievements.</p><p>At least that's what Conservatives are peddling; the honest answer is much more complicated. According to the Pew Research Center, around 39% of Americans believed the Patriot Act was a "necessary tool that helps the government find terrorists," while 34% said it "goes too far and poses a threat to civil liberties," and a quarter were unsure.</p><p>Clark defended the decision by subtly mocking the former President's famous "Mission Accomplished" sign embarrassment over Iraq, having a "Mission Accomplished" sign wave behind him as he claimed that the Patriot Act had served its purpose and was no longer needed.</p><p>The move was hailed by a bipartisan coalition of America's most prominent politicians, such as Texas Congressman Ron Paul and Ohio's Dennis Kucinich, but it has been widely dodged politically by the broader Democratic Party and scorned by Republicans.</p><p>Bush, who until now largely avoided the political spotlight, now represents a larger divide over US counter terrorism efforts. The former President closed his remarks saying, "we cannot forget what happened that one morning on September 11th, and it's up to us to fight so we never witness that again."</p><p>Whether Bush intends to reenter the national arena or remain committed to being a political benchwarmer remains to be seen. For now, one thing is clear: the line of bipartisanship has been crossed, and the gloves are off quite early into Clark's second term.</p>`)

<p><b>By ZEKE MILLER</b></p><p><b>August 27, 2009</b></p> <p>Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell has often poached the Connecticut Senator to caucus with Republicans ever since the independent split with Democrats in 2006. Lieberman failed to be renominated by Democrats after Businessman Ned Lamont rode the wave of disgruntled Democrats upset with Lieberman's vote for the Iraq War. The Senator refused to quit and started his own Connecticut For Lieberman Party, which took the lead in polls and eventually beat Lamont despite President Clark hyper-fixating on the race as a target flip.</p><p>Clark and Lieberman's long-standing feud began the moment the General announced his intention to run for President. Lieberman often criticized Clark as a Republican in disguise who only ran because the opportunity opened up. Clark would beat back opponents skeptical of his party loyalty, and despite taking the White House and the Senate back for Democrats, Lieberman remained skeptical of the president-elect's intentions.</p><p>Soon, the tension between the two men would blow into a media firestorm as Lieberman, more often than not, stood in Clark's way. Clark began to refer to the Senator as a roadblock to progress and enthusiastically threw his support behind Lamont.</p><p>Now, after years of party alienation, Lieberman has chosen to throw his hat with the Republican for the latter half of his final term in office. The President has commented that it's a move fueled purely by spite. Lieberman, when announcing his choice to caucus with Republicans, stated, "The Democratic Party has foregone any efforts of bipartisanship in favor of appealing to a personality cult. My decision to caucus with Republicans will not change the way I choose to vote, I will simply seek to aid bipartisan efforts led by Senator Snowe and Collins."</p> <p>With President Clark eyeing up bolder legislative feats, this may jeopardize his agenda for the remainder of his term in office.</p>Associated Press writers Lisa Mascaro, Stephen Groves and Kevin Freking in Washington, Darlene Superville in Kissimmee, Fla., and Bill Barrow in Atlanta contributed to this report.<p><b>Associated Press writers Lisa Mascaro, Stephen Groves and Kevin Freking in Washington, Darlene Superville in Kissimmee, Fla., and Bill Barrow in Atlanta contributed to this report.</b></p>`)

The mask slipped.</p><p>American sovereignty is under attack from a rogue globalist vision perpetrated by President Wesley Clark, the former NATO general turned Democratic golden boy. Last week, on the snowy stage in Davos, Clark assembled his internationalist goons to stand beside him and deliver a love letter to globalism.</p><p>Flanked by internationalist elites, prissy bankers, climate bureaucrats, and IMF kingpins, Clark hailed the work of none other than British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, yes, that same architect of the UK's spend all you can give bailout binge for his "visionary leadership" during the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p>So what was Clark's grand idea to hoist upon the rest of us?

<p><b>Kyle Doyle</b> - Economist with an Opinion on everything<u> Experienced in government and diplomacy Author has <b>2.6K</b> answers and <b>789.3K</b> answer views Updated 3m</u></p> <p>Resigning is putting the events nicely. It's safe to say that Republicans have not been able to heal the wounds left by the 2008 election disaster. The wounds are only a symptom of the growing friction between Republicans—congressmen like Boehner, who were holdovers from the Gingrich-led "Contract with America" era, and those who have joined Congress more recently. The Tea Party Movement quickly grew after the wilderness period following the dramatic defeat of George W. Bush's compassionate conservatism wing of the party in 2004.</p><p>Boehner had the label of a "compromiser" stuck to his forehead and would quickly lose grip over Congress after he helped pass different aspects of the Clark agenda. I suspect that Boehner has grown tired of the role, given the incessant dogfight that became the passage of the Matthew Shepard Act, which only boiled further Tea Party frustration with his tenure. Republicans are angry, and the loss to Wesley Clark last year put a deep dent in party morale. Boehner couldn't effectively channel that rage as a leader of the opposition.</p> <p><b>Marty Mascili</b> - I have studied my opposition my entire lifetime and i know them as well or better than my own side.<u>Author <b>40K</b> answers and <b>647k</b> answer views . Updated 9m</u></p>   <p>He's cashing in when the donors are clamoring for a change in leadership. Tea Party assholes botched the election for us by making Republicans look like jackasses, and now this. Think that I'm wrong? Imagine this: the most likely successor to take Boehner's position is Mike Pence, who failed to win party leadership in 2007. Now he's spearheading the drop John movement. I'll List my top 3 reasons I believe hes resigning for.</p><p><b>No power;</b> it was widely expected that Republicans would sweep the House in 2008, but in the exodus of a humiliating loss, the Republican base is hungry for change. Failing to win an election is one thing; failing to form an opposition to the incumbent party's legislation coherently is worse.</p> <p><b>His career has hit a plateau;</b> it was unlikely that Republicans would ever look to John Boehner as an optimal presidential or vice presidential candidate as they did for Speaker Gingrich. Although they are of the same ideology, Gingrich, at the height of his career, was a Republican trailblazer, and even then, the party would grow tired of him soon after 1996. I'll note that Gingrich might be planning a presidential run now, but it's a long shot. Boehner has nowhere to go but down, so he might try to bail himself out to avoid further shame on his legacy.</p><p><b>Something is coming, something terrible;</b> we can't ignore the previous speaker, Dennis Hastert, who underwent extreme career-ending allegations of pedophilia. Boehner, if not convinced to retire by the rapid growth of partisan politics in the Republican Party, might be running to escape something. All I'm saying is to keep a lookout for some damning evidence of wrongdoing on his part.</p><p><b>Sandy Dillon</b> - Mom who knows her stuff <u>Author has <b>1.1K</b> answers and <b>99.3K</b> answer views 6m</u></p><p>Republicans are tired of party leadership after consistent disappointment in both 2004, 2006, and 2008. Wesley Clark, ever coming within a sniff of the presidency, was a mistake, and he swept through the Senate, claiming a bare majority while still losing those who were promised a bold opposition party. Instead, we got a collapsing Republican leadership in the House, from Tom Delay's indictment to the Terri Schiavo nonsense backfiring. It all hit us twice as hard. The outcome of the last election shocked the world, and Republicans still can't pick up the pieces from the loss. McConnell should look to Boehner's resignation as an example of fear. Now we're hearing of more Republican Senators like Nevada's John Ensign possibly being involved in an affair. Democrats smell weakness. It's time for Republicans to get tough.</p>`)

With Brown's measured diplomacy seemingly working its natural charm, some have even floated that he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize, although these claims are premature.</p><p>Observers attribute Brown's success in pulling America back to his prior feats in advising Clark's economic recovery response last year and other diplomatic efforts, which developed a "strong friendship" between the Western leaders.</p><p>Although fighting continues even now, it appears that an end is in sight, and despite American saber-rattling, this conflict can come to an end.

The electrifying candidacy of Vice President Palin, challenging her boss, was unprecedented. Sadly, for her, lightning failed to manifest in Des Moines, Iowa.</p><p>The Vice President placed nearly all her eggs in the Iowa voters' basket with faith that she'd defeat President Romney right out of the gate. Positioning herself as the fiery conservative alternative to Romney's cautious Republicanism, she stormed the Iowa caucuses with faith that she could win. Yet after her disappointing 8-point loss to the president, her campaign's spotlight is beginning to dim.</p><p>Palin torched whatever remained of her relationship with the president after she went on a media tour chastising Romney over the "Bipartisan Border Security" bill that flew off his desk with his signature. "I didn't come to Washington hoping to make nice with liberals over basic conservative ideals," said Palin during an interview with Fox News. But such a message failed to impress Iowa voters.</p><p>Romney took the challenge to his political throne lightheartedly in public. Still, according to campaign insiders, the strong showing at Iowa was crafted by an airtight campaign. Palin often criticized Romney supporters for looking like they came "straight out of one of them Matrix movies," but unlike Neo, Palin failed to dodge what might be the killing blow to her attempt at the presidency.</p><p>Political observers attribute the poor performance to Palin's erratic debate moments and the frequent staff shake-ups, which prevent voters from taking her seriously. Meanwhile, most Republicans are feeling the heat of an identity crisis shaping what could be the party's broader failures in the coming months. The question remains whether they will stay committed to Romney's business-oriented approach with a flirtatious relationship with the other side of the aisle or ditch calls for bipartisanship and align with the romantic Tea Party conservatism brought by Palin.</p><p>What stands for sure is that Republicans can no longer have it both ways. They will need to choose, while neither looks entirely convincing as a winning strategy this November.</p>`)

But he’s so blinded by profits and not hurting his bedfellows in big polluting corporations that he has made the conscious decision to actively weaken environmental protections, even though he has more power than anyone else in America to put a stop to this.</p><p><b>REPORTER:</b> What else has the president done?</p><p><b>CRIST: </b>Again, lots of things. This is a refrain that you’re going to hear from me moving forward. But if I had to pick one singular other area where the president and I disagree, it’s over his immigration policy. He is, to put it simply, both naive and cruel when it comes to deciding who gets to come to our country and who’s not allowed, and I won’t tolerate supporting it any further.</p><p><b>REPORTER: </b>Mr. Crist, is it true that you and Romney had a screaming match in the Oval Office a week ago?</p><p><b>CRIST:</b> It’s a half truth. Nobody screamed, but it certainly got a bit heated.</p><p><b>REPORTER: </b>Who do you hope to see picked as your successor as VP?</p><p><b>CRIST: </b>Hopefully someone with a high tolerance for nonsense. Whoever that it, I wish them the absolute best, because they’re really going to need it dealing with this administration.</p><p><b>REPORTER: </b>Mr. Crist, what are your plans now that you’re out of office?</p><p><b>CRIST: </b>I’ve thought about this long and hard, and I’ve decided that I’m going to run for president in 2012 as a Democrat.</p><p><b>REPORTER: </b>Why are you choosing to switch parties after having supported the Republicans for so long?</p><p><b>CRIST: </b>At this stage, I honestly feel like the Democratic Party better encapsulates my values than whatever the Republicans have turned into. That’s why I’m going to run for their nomination.</p><p><b>REPORTER: </b>Given the fact that you were elected as a Republican just two years ago, why should Democrats trust you? Why should they elect you? </p><p><b>CRIST: </b>That’s going to be their call to make. They don’t have to support me, but I’m going to make the absolute best case I can as to why they should. The rest of it will be solely up to the primary voters; all I can do is conduct myself accordingly.</p><p><b>CRIST: </b>Okay, this next one will be my last question for now.</p><p><b>REPORTER: </b>Mr. Crist, if you were to win the Democratic nomination and face off against President Romney as the presumptive nominee, what would the prospect of beating him feel like?</p><p><b>Crist: </b>…It would feel very good.</p>`)

<p>If you don't know who to vote for in the 2012 elections and are having a hard time keeping track of who said what among the 11 candidates, help is here. ABC News and USA Today have created the Match-O-Matic, a cheery little game that asks you a handful of questions about the Economy, Immigration, Health Care and Hot Topics (gay marriage, taxation, global warming, and a candidate's experience) before spitting out a list of three candidates whose views are closest to yours. A scorecard on the side shows where you agreed and disagreed, and displays a short quote from the candidate addressing each issue.</p><p>The first time I tried, I answered as honestly as I could, without trying to influence the choice in a more liberal or conservative direction. That gave me Tom Steyer, Bernie Sanders and Caroline Kennedy as 1-2-3.</p><p>I tried again, this time being a bit more "realistic"—meaning conservative—with my answers. This time I got Joe Sestak, Tom Daschle and Rod Blagojevich.</p><p>Unfortunately the site says nothing about the methodology behind the game other than a statement that appears briefly on one screen that says "Answers gathered from statements and speeches by candidates and catalogued by USA Today." Not a very enlightening explanation of the research behind the game.</p><p>The final question on experience annoys me. Here are your choices:</p><p>What if I have no preference, or want both "U.S. Senate" and "served in military," or "has run a business" and "served as governor or mayor"? No go.</p><p>I don't know how heavily this question is weighted, but you can see that a single answer can push your choice toward a specific candidate.</p><p>So, is this anything more than a fun way to spend a few minutes on a Monday night? Actually, I think it is. I never gave a thought to Tom Steyer or Joe Sestak, but now I'm going to learn more about them. Sadly, of course, none of my top three candidates have a snowball's chance in hell of being on the ballot.</p><p>If you want more than a fun, painless suggestion on who to vote for, try the VoteMatch quiz instead. It's not as slick but is much more thoughtful. The questions are similar, but you give your answer on a scale of 1 to 5, from "Support" to "Oppose." Each question links to a detailed explanation of the topic, explaining what each answer means, giving background information and defining "buzzwords" often tossed around when the topic is discussed.</p><p>VoteMatch quiz results screen Steyer was at the top of my list again, but Clinton popped up at number two, and there's Caroline Kennedy again, coming in third.</p><p>You can answer the questions as quickly as with Match-O-Matic, maybe even faster because you don't have to wait for spiffy graphics to update. You can also take your time and read extensive background information on the questions and on the candidates when you get your results.</p><p>The site is quite transparent about its content and staff. Staff members are named, with a bit of information about each. You can find links to the source material used to determine a candidate's position on an issue. Steyer, for example, has listed 17 quotes on the Environment, 5 on Economic Equality, and 2 on Healthcare. Blagojevich has 26 on Anti Corruption, 10 on Crime, and 20 on Taxes. As Illinois Governor, his record on these topics are also shown.</p><p>Most importantly, for each possible answer in the VoteMatch quiz you can see exactly what statement by the candidate was used to determine his/her position as well as the number of points the answer is worth. Much more helpful than the "behind the green curtain" approach of Match-O-Matic. Give them both a try and let us know how it works out by clicking "Comments" below.</p> <p><b>Update (October 30, 2012)</b>It's hard to believe that anyone might be undecided after all the publicity about both candidates, but just in case... I've explained my reasons for voting for Steyer in an essay titled <b>What if?</b></p>`)

Later, revealing that the season's theme was "Second Chances," referring to the fact that the 2008 recession impacted all the contestants.</p><p>He later went into a rant about the Bush Administration's efforts in combating China by "selling the American worker," as Trump put it. He claimed Bush was letting the world "eat our lunch" by signing free trade deals screwing over the American auto industry and farm industry.</b></p><p>President Bush, who championed the agreements with India, Japan, and the Philippines to combat Chinese economic prowess, has stood by his efforts, calling them "necessary deals to keep America in the lead."

Senator Clinton has come under fire from many other Democratic opponents like John Edwards for working too closely with the Bush administration.</p><p>Mr. Trump then went into a tirade, lambasting President Bush, claiming he was a "no show on the job" getting paid to go on vacations abroad and asking, "Why would you pay a man $400,000 a year for a no-show job?" Much of the reality TV host's candidacy has been orbiting President Bush's failures to protect the American worker from "immigrants taking our jobs" and his push for free trade deals that "sell American farmers out."</p><p>The once-crowded field of establishment Democratic candidates has slowly dwindled after Trump's surprising victory in Iowa and the New Hampshire upset outcome of Senator Bernie Sanders taking the plurality. This effectively handicaps Senator Hillary Clinton's campaign as the candidates prepare to enter the South Carolina contest in what may decide who the next Democratic nominee will be.</p><p>Of those who remain, Former House Majority Leader Gephardt, after placing fourth in Iowa, many wonder why he's chosen to remain in the race, with many suspecting he hopes to revive his campaign at South Carolina or make a bid for VP of one of the mainline candidates.</p><p>While Senator Bernie Sanders polls poorly in most primaries leading up to Super Tuesday, he may drop out and throw his support behind Trump as an anti-establishment last stand.</p><p>Trump is expected to perform admirably in South Carolina, but if Edwards becomes the frontrunner in the long term, he may be in for a tough time.</p><p>Senator Clinton stands the most bruised in the race as most expected her to take the New Hampshire Primary with relative ease, now must place all her bets on beating Edwards in South Carolina.</p><p>John Edwards appears to be the front runner in waiting, and with Clinton's campaign is faltering, her defeat here can effectively boot her out of the race. If Edwards can secure the position as the last man with any ties to the establishment left, he'd enjoy frontrunner status and be able to watch as Trump and Sanders fizzle out by Super Tuesday.</p><p>Polls predict an Edwards victory after campaigning heavily with leaders of the black community in South Carolina.</p><h3>34-37% Edwards</h3><h3>26-28% Clinton</h3><h3>15-18% Trump</h3><h3></h3><h3>12-14% Sanders</h3><h3>5-9% Gephardt</h3>`)

For two years in office, the main story was about gold, liberty, trying and failing to abolish the Fed. During that time, he was garden-variety unpopular, and perhaps the only interesting thing about him was the extent to which he lost in the midterms, with the Democrats winning a whopping 280 House seats and flipping the Senate. But then, after the fact, he gave a speech on the results. You already know what we’re about to play.</p><p><b>[Hard cut to clip of RON PAUL at a rally, shouting at a podium.]</b></p><p><b>RON PAUL:</b></p><p>There is a Jewish cabal that’s running this country!

I'm just saying what everyone else is afraid to say!</p><p><b>[Cut back to Leah in disbelief.]</b></p><p><b>LEAH:</b></p><p>So yeah, that happened. Since then, Paul’s approval rating has been bad, really bad. But, in what I’m sure isn’t a great surprise, his approval rating among American Jews dropped to one percent. Not ten. One. That’s statistically… basically zero. But still, there’s someone out there, one person somewhere who responded to a poll and identified as a Jew, that supports Ron Paul. That’s like your bubbie liking Mel Gibson’s films after reading the transcript of his arrest, or your rabbi coming out as a really big Henry Ford admirer.</p><p>So today, I’m wandering around New York’s Jewish neighborhoods, trying to find the one Jew who still supports Ron Paul.</p><p><b>[Montage: Leah asking elderly Hasidic men, hipster Jews in Williamsburg, Israeli expats, Chabad rabbis. Everyone shakes their head, waves her off, or starts yelling in Yiddish.]</b></p><p><b>ELDERLY MAN (Hasidic, subtitled):</b></p><p>Ron Paul is… meshuggeneh. He wants to destroy the dollar and give us all chickens!</p><p><b>YOUNG WOMAN (Modern Orthodox):</b></p><p>I would rather vote for a Hezbollah candidate before I vote for him.

I’ve had six different people tell me I’m doing “a chillul Hashem” just for asking about Ron Paul. Two guys accused me of being Mossad. Another woman thought I was doing a spiel for Purim. I had one guy claim that I needed to check my mother’s ancestry a little closer after I confirmed that yes, I am actually Jewish.

He first became a real Paul supporter in 2009 after someone on a survivalist message board sent him a PDF about the gold standard.

Mordy is now animated.]</b></p><p><b>MORDY:</b></p><p>The media turned on him because he said the quiet part out loud. We know there’s influence. Look around. You’ve got AIPAC, ADL, Goldman Sachs.

Just because you and I aren’t personally represented in the cabal doesn’t mean that there’s not a cabal. Look, Ron Paul isn't an antisemite. He’s a pro-truth-about-semites.

<p><b>By Andrew Scott</b></p> <p>American International Group was saved while on the brink of collapse during the 2008 Great Recession by then President Clark's administration and at the time it was justified as a “non-negotiable” to save the economy. Now just a year later The Washington Post has broken the story that AIG plans to use part of the bailout funds to payout over 165 million dollars worth of bonuses to 400 employees.</p> <p>The outrage stirred by multiple news organizations like The New York Times which reminded us “the same business unit that brought the company to the brink of collapse last year.” National outrage over an almost comical situation followed the story's landfall. President Huckabee has propelled himself to the forefront of this outrage threatening executive action against AIG if it were to follow through with these bonus bailouts. “America had to foot the bill for your mistakes and now you want to use that money to pat yourselves on the back for a good job?” Huckabee said when addressing the controversy.</p><p>It's a strange unifying movement behind the outrage between the left and right with Independent and self proclaimed socialist Senator Bernie Sanders passionately denouncing the scandal. Many are advocating that President Huckabee go after AIG and force them to repay the bailouts by the end of the year. Huckabee has flirted with the idea and also debated shutting down all government agencies used to bailout private firms and businesses.</p><p>Arguments in favor of AIG's position state that AIG would have trouble attracting and retaining talent “if employees believe their compensation is subject to continued and arbitrary adjustment by the U.S. Treasury.” The Huckabee Administration has found thus totally unacceptable and signaled that action against the bonuses will be taken in some form.</p><p><b>Related Articles</b></p><span style="color:blue;"><u>Impeachment?

The specimen in question was later confirmed to be a dolphin fetus.</p><p>As she expressed great biblical joy for legislative victories in restricting abortion access nationwide, she uttered the words "We won't rest until every single boy and girl to be protected by our constitution!" Bachmann declared a war on those seeking to disenfranchise the Bible while cradling a four-inch-long gray-finned embryo. "This baby could have cured cancer, solved world hunger or even be the Second Coming!" Instead, our little baby Jesus with a snout was slaughtered on the operating table.</p><p>The crowd, once fervently cheering, soon quieted after getting a better view of the supposed human baby. Campaign aides quickly ushered a still shouting Bachmann of the stage as she claimed God blessed her tiny little human.</p><p>Marine Biologists from the University of California confirmed that the embryo was, in fact, not human, but "unmistakably a bottlenose dolphin fetus." </p><p>White House Chief of Staff Rob Wasinger found himself defending Bachmann, having to explain that her rhetoric was merely "displaying an example," like science teachers show anatomy with a frog.</p><p>The episiotomy garnered an array of late-night comedy fodder with Jimmy Kimmel joking that Bachmann had "finally discovered a constituency willing to swim with her."</p><p>Meanwhile, President Brownback stood by his number two, stating that "the message was clear and so was God's. America stands for life however you define it, even aquatic."</p>`)

She gave her public statement statement to NBC News reporters here:</p> <p>"After my son passed, I learned that he had several discussions about homosexuality with school administrators and was told that being gay was a choice, he was told that he was making a mistake. My son is dead, he wasn't a mistake, he wasn't making a choice and you are the people responsible for this. When the Vice President stands for bullying, when our President demonizes people for their sexuality, this is the result. Are you happy now, was it worth it, all you propagandists telling the world that people, kids like my son are dangerous? Just so you can pass some fucking amendment? Well guess what you got your wish, my son is dead, you killed my son President Brownback. I hope you're fucking happy."</p><p>Sadly, This news is one of many we've witnessed in the last few months. Mrs. James was gracious enough to share the note left behind from her son. Please be advised of its dark content.</p><p><b>"Dear Mom, I'm writing this to say goodbye and hopefully help give you comfort.

They constantly tell me I'm a mistake, I don't know who found out I was gay but the rumor spread around the whole school and I feel other kids are constantly watching me. My friends won't talk to me anymore and when I tried to bring it up with Mrs. Shelby told me being gay was a choice. I don't know how I made the choice but I feel wrong and I just want everything to go back to normal. I want to be normal, but I can't. I don't know why I'm like this. Tell Alice she can have my room and that I'll miss her a lot. I'll miss you a lot mom, I want you to know that. This isn't your fault. It's mine. Goodbye."</b></p><p>Seeing the number of stories we're seeing come through is horrifying. Anti-bullying and gay rights activists have joined forces to protest and advocate for legislation and the repeal of the Federal Marriage Amendment. These tragedies make the case more apparent than ever. We need to do better, America; we need to be a kinder and more accepting nation.</p>`)

<p><b>Josephine Moulds</b></p> <p>According to a leading international think tank, China will overtake the U.S. economy in the next two years and become the largest economy in the world by 2013.</p> <p>The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that due to the U.S. economy hitting its 7th consecutive quarter of GDP decline since President Brownback's "Great American Tax Experiment," China can overtake the U.S. economy by the end of 2012. Asa Johansson, senior economist at the OECD, said: "It is quite a shift in the balance of economic power we are going to see in the future."</p><p>The tax cuts were the largest in American history and caused massive budget shortfalls.

<p>Middle East</p><p><b>CODEPINK stands with the people rising across the Middle East. Clark's American Tyranny under attack!</b></p><p><b>Date: September 15, 2011</b></p><p><b>Author: Code Pink Collective</b></p><p>The world has reached its tipping point. Across the occupied nations held by President Wesley Clark, uprisings are growing, fueled by occupation, broken promises, and crimes against humanity. These nations, Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, and Syria, will no longer bend the knee to tyranny from across the world. As the Clark administration hails the situation as perfectly stable, it neglects the power Americans have at home to rebuke political theater, keeping the curtains closed. Behind the mirage are countless war crimes conducted by rogue military organizations, while the same elite that profits from our labor dip their toes in Middle Eastern blood.</p><p>Clark is no champion of democracy. The free world America sings the praises of is funded by atrocities in the third world. Twice entrusted to the presidency on the back of fear of the change Ron Paul promised, and instead of ending American wars, he's started as many as possible. By doubling down on American crimes, he has abandoned the people at home, unable to afford their mortgage, and a jobs market unable to provide. Freedom is diminished under an administration that claims it's slain the axis of evil.</p><p>In response to the Clark administration's ramping up of troops in occupied nations, Code Pink is organizing nationwide protests to stand in solidarity against the American tyrannical complex. We call on everyone, activists, students, teachers, and workers, to stand up and fight for justice. Scream as loud as you can. Reject America's role, reject tyranny. </p><p>Vice President Landrieu's claim that we are "privileged" for having the ability to fight against the administration is a startling echo of an authoritarian thought experiment. The president is testing the waters to see how hard we're willing to fight for what's right. We must show them that you cannot occupy other nations, fund war criminal organizations, or neglect the needs of those at home on the American taxpayers' dime.</p><p>The idea that Wesley Clark has engaged in "polite diplomacy" is a facade backed by the same machine that told us we were unpatriotic for protesting the war in Iraq.</p><p>Join the Movement. Raise your voice, Stan, for peace and reject authoritarianism. Join us.</p><p><b>Solidarity with the uprising.</b></p><p><b>We hope to see everyone soon. Keep up the fight! </b></p><p><b>Until Liberation, </b></p><p><b>Medea, Jodie, Danaka, Jenin, Michelle, Aaron, Tim, Becca, Makayla, and the ENTIRE CODEPINK Team!</b></p><p>PS: For 9 years, we've been disrupting and organizing with your love, support, and generosity. Your support has never been more crucial as we march forward for peace and justice. Donate now!</p>`)

<p><b>By Murtaza Hussain</b></p> <p>President Clark made history weeks ago when he signed Executive Order 13767, which effectively revived internment camps styled after those used in WW2.</p><p>The executive order was crafted in response to the Charlottesville shooting in which eight civilians were killed in what was later labeled a domestic terrorist attack. President Clark justified the decision at a press conference where he stated:</p><p>"If these people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they are disloyal to the United States as a matter of principle, fine. It's their right and it's our right and obligation to segregate them from the normal community for the duration of the conflict, if someone supported Nazi Germany at the expense of the United States, we didn't say that was freedom of speech, we put him in a camp, they were prisoners of war."</p><p>This was in response to heavy criticism of his decision to remain in Iraq and Afghanistan and expand drone warfare, taking out targets in Pakistan and Syria. With mass protests at home and abroad, he's faced intense scrutiny from many within his own party, who call for the President to back down from this hill.</p><p>Multiple courts across the country immediately questioned the executive order's legality and put it to the test, halting the creation of a single camp. Now, in a 6-1 decision, the teeth of the executive order have essentially been pulled before it could even be put into action.</p><p>The entire debacle has become a political bruise for the President, with most of his party distancing themselves from his decision.</p><p><b>ABOUT</b></p><p><b>SUPPORT US</b></p><p><b>NEWSLETTER</b></p>`)

Secretary of State John Kerry, who stayed on for the job despite repeated disagreements with the President's conduct, has been equally left washed ashore as word spreads of a possible resignation is looming.</p><p>Secretary Kerry has disavowed the claims, but his isolation from the rest of the State Department gives him all the reason to call it quits despite his high public approval.

<p>Bankruptcy F.C. is a British television sitcom, created by Matt Berry and Arthur Matthews, starring Berry as George Dross, a banker at Barclays who must take his charity football league seriously when the bank collapses during the <b>Global Recession</b>. The sitcom was critically acclaimed and earned Berry the 2012 BAFTA Award for Best Male Comedy Performance.</p><p><b>Series 1 (2011)</b></p><p><b>Episode 1:</b></p><p>George comes home from work at Barclays to learn that his entire company has crashed due to its acquisition of Lehman Brothers, with George having been part of the Lehman Brothers acquisition team. Out of a job, he is despondent about his chances, as his association with Lehman brothers makes him a banking pariah. However, George realizes that Barclays has submitted a team to a charity football league with a prize of $300,000 pounds, which goes to the charity of the winning team’s captain’s choosing.</p><p>The next day, George officially joins the team, not revealing his true intentions to the rest of the players. When one of the players has to withdraw due to an STD, George recruits his sister Miranda, a professional pole-vaulter and all-around athlete, to the team. The team wins their first match after George and Miranda become embroiled in an argument on the field, distracting most of the players and allowing the Barclays striker to walk home the winning goal.</p><p><b>Episode 2:</b></p><p>George’s teammate Devin, also unemployed, undergoes a divorce after his wife learns that he spent all of the couple’s money on cleats for the team. George and Miranda attempt to cheer Devin up by hiring a call girl, but things go haywire when the call girl turns out to be extremely attractive and intelligent, causing Devin to consider immediately starting a relationship with her.</p><p>After learning that he hired the call girl before their divorce was finalized, Devin’s wife forces him to publicly humiliate himself in a series of embarrassing tasks on the streets of London so that she doesn’t use it for leverage in their divorce settlement. George and Miranda attempt to re-contact the call girl to warn her to stay away from Devin, but to no avail. In the team’s game, although they face the prospect of a draw against a weaker side, Devin sees the call girl in the stands and she flashes her breasts at him, giving him the courage to convert a bicycle kick from outside the goalie box, winning the game.</p></b></p>Episode 3:<p><b><p>While manipulating a friend into buying him an expensive lunch, George learns that many of the bankers have orchestrated golden parachutes for themselves in case of Barclays’ failure, leaving them unscathed by the collapse. Infuriated, George starts an argument with his old boss, which accidentally leads to the old boss, drunk and angry, falling out of the restaurant to his death. George is then arrested for manslaughter.</p><p>Due largely to George’s imprisonment, the team loses the next game. Miranda attempts to contact the boss’ family in order to explain what had happened, but is unable to locate a single family member who speaks of him positively. In a last-ditch effort, Miranda attends his funeral, but finds herself accidentally conducting the entire ceremony. After the ceremony, Miranda locates the boss’ only child, Lyudmila, the result of the boss’ “obsession with Ukrainian hookers.” Miranda is able to seduce Lyudmila and get her to advocate for George, leading to him being released from jail after a set of wild adventures behind bars.</p><p><b>Episode 4:</b></p><p>While looking for a fish and chips shop that he can actually afford, George accidentally wanders into a sketchy part of London and finds himself inside an illegal bookie’s shop. The bookie recognizes George from a story about Lehman Brothers’ failure and offers him a deal to throw the league’s games in exchange for more money than he could earn from winning the league. George gladly accepts, though the bookie warns him that there will be hell to pay should he fail.</p><p>At the team’s next game, George tries his best to lose purposefully, but Miranda, with Lyudmila cheering her on, has the game of her life and scores a hat-trick, winning the game handily. George fearfully tries to evade the bookie’s men, as they are accidentally incapacitated one by one while trying to locate him. Finally, the bookie himself finds and threatens to stab George while the two of them are in Trafalgar Square. However, the bookie’s exaggerated mannerisms and clothing, alongside George’s boisterous counters, convince the crowd that the two of them are acting out a live performance. The crowd showers them with money, allowing the bookie to cover his losses and George to escape intact.</p><p><b>Episode 5:</b></p><p>The team loses a heartbreaker of a match, making the league’s last game an all-or-nothing affair. In search of a spark of inspiration for the team, George announces a surprise trip to Washington D.C. after winning a televised prize competition whose reward is British Airways miles. The team is excited to visit America, but soon learns that it was not all they had hoped it would be, as despair and political polarization are omnipresent on the Washington streets.</p><p>George realizes that the team is despondent and almost certain to lose their next game, and decides to cheer them up by taking them to a cultural exchange program held at the Kennedy Center, where the British team can take joy in their favorite pastime of belittling Americans. While the team is midway through the cultural program, finding little success, the American President (a fictionalized version of <b>Wesley Clark</b>, played by <b>Anthony Head</b>) drops by as a surprise guest. George, still upset at the U.S. government for allowing Lehman brothers to fail, tears into the President for his economic missteps, pointing to his dreadful approval rating and causing him to cry in front of the team. Realizing that George went too far, Miranda comforts him one-on-one, and cheers him back up by talking about his past bombing Serbians and how she, as a Brit, thinks that “<b>Mike Jackson</b> is an idiot.” The newly cheerful President gives a roaring pep talk, breathing new life into the team.</p><p><b>Episode 6:</b></p><p>The team faces its toughest opponent yet in the charity league: HSBC UK, which has now replaced Barclays as the largest bank in Britain. In the first half, the HSBC team races out to a 3-1 lead over Barclays, with their players openly mocking the Barclays team for being out of a job. At halftime, the team is ready to give up, but George reminds them how much more money they have at stake than the employed HSBC team does. This realization sparks the team to new heights, and they dominate the second half, with George assisting Miranda on a header to win the game and league in stoppage time.</p><p>Upon being presented with the winner’s check, George announces his plans to donate it to the “Doss Liberation Fund,” and vanishes from the rest of the squad. A flashback set two months later shows George, Miranda, and Lyudmila on the beach in Greece, where they marvel at how affordable the country has become for them after its <b>debt crisis</b>. George takes a phone call from a former team member demanding to know where the money is, but laughs and hangs up before toasting the two women, who toast back.</p>`)

<p><b>By Sally Wylin – March 3, 2010</b></p><p>Former New York City Mayor and longtime Democratic power broker Ed Koch has rescinded his endorsement of President Wesley Clark. An early supporter of Bush in 2004 and later Clark in 2008, Koch backtracked his support in a statement claiming that the President put Israel's security in jeopardy through his "Hazzard and shortsighted withdrawal from Iraq."</p><p>"I believed Clark was the greater good and while I had significant concerns about his plans to withdraw from Iraq so soon I felt that if it wasn't him, the Democrats would be coaxed into fielding a real nut in 2012," Said Koch during an interview on Hannity. "I like both my Republicans and Democrats to take the issue of terror seriously and I'm willing to do anything to stop Howard Dean's and Pat Buchanan's from usurping the two party system," he continued.</p><p>Clark, who began preparations for a steady withdrawal from Iraq following the 2006 midterms, finalized the withdrawal of all armed forces in July 2009. While Clark defends his policy, claiming that "the mission is finally accomplished," Koch and other hawkish Democrats, even within his own administration, have loudly voiced their fears.</p><p>"I mean, I supported Clark because he was a general, he has the necessary experience but whether it be negligence or blatant disregard for Israel's safety he's abandoned the epicenter of the world on terror," Koch decried, visibly emotional. "Tehran smells blood in the water and whatever happens next it will fall on the President's shoulders," he added.</p><p>White House Chief of Staff Terry McAuliffe dismissed Koch's remarks as "needlessly divisive" and "grounded not in reality but speculation." </p><p>Still, Koch remains an influential voice in the Jewish community, and he's not alone in his rhetorical crusade against the rash actions of the Clark administration. Koch later added that "the Democratic Party lost my trust and I cannot issue an endorsement for any Democrat running this cycle." </p>`)

<p><b>By James Naughtie</b></p><p><b>Special Correspondent, Radio 4 News</b></p><p><b>9 July 2010</b></p><p><b>A Fall Few Could Have Predicted</b></p><p>If you went back in time to 1997 and told the average Brit that the super-star icon who had swept them off their feet and to the polls would be where he is now, they'd have a good laugh. Now, as we live history in the moment, there are cheers and laughs. Tony Blair has marched his party into an early grave due to his ego and hopes to regain his stolen valor from his previous failings.</p><p><b>Collapse from Within</b></p><p>Echoing shock and horror from the Blair campaign headquarters only served to further question where the Prime Minister believed he was taking his party. It's not like polls ever favored his chances or his ability to claim victory. After Chancellor Brown's dramatic exit in late 2009 following the announcement of Blair's intentions to run for another term, the Labour Party began to spiral out of stability and grace.</p><p><b>From Magic to Missteps</b></p><p>When Blair triumphed over Major in a stunning rebuke of Thatcherism, the world clapped as near magic swept through the country. Welcomed by President Bill Clinton, their relationship grew strong with diplomatic ties that would further expand to George W. Bush.</p><p>That is where the trouble began. When the September 11th attacks struck the heart of America, Blair stood by Bush as a showing of solidarity. He then followed Bush into both Afghanistan and, more controversially, Iraq—sinking British credibility on the American promise that Saddam Hussain held nuclear capabilities.</p><p>When the Bush administration came up short in providing evidence for such claims, so did Blair.</p><p><b>The Magnetism of Controversy</b></p><p>From then on, controversy would stick to Blair like a magnet, and despite coming out of the 2005 election victorious, the Labour Party was stung by the losses. The magic that captivated the country was rapidly dissipating, and rumors of a rift between Prime Minister Blair and Chancellor Brown circled the media.</p><p>It was then Blair was offered a blessing: General Wesley Clark had stormed onto the American political scene, decapitating the Bush administration before it could cause him any more trouble. President Clark won the 2004 election on the promise that he would bring a change in strategy to Iraq. That change would be a firm withdrawal deadline, offering Blair political room to wiggle around Brown's threats of resigning and continuing his premiership.</p><p><b>Iraq, Again, and the Temptation of a Fourth Term</b></p><p>Working closely with President Clark, they handled Iraq and all of its controversy together. Withdrawing from Iraq would become Blair's championing policy—which apparently made him pursue an ambitious fourth term.</p><p>Speculation that Blair would call the election in mid-to-late 2009 caught the Conservative Party flat footed, and polls showed a possible Blair victory at hand if the election were to be called.</p><p>What Blair hadn't expected was the fury from Chancellor Gordon Brown, who expected him to step aside for the party's sake. Brown resigned, causing a total meltdown within the Labour Party and effectively killing Blair's hope to call an election early—with Labour MPs loudly against it.</p><p><b>The Beginning of the End</b></p><p>So Blair had to watch his potential victory squandered by an unwilling Labour Party. David Cameron's Conservative Party would then rebound in the polls after the good feelings from the Iraq withdrawal faded and the economic woes returned.</p><p>Blair slowly marched through the end of 2009 to 2010, deeply scarred by Brown's exit. Remaining determined to ride out the general election despite horrific polling across the provinces, he charged at the poor circumstances head-on—now promising a continuation of the economic recovery from the 2008 recession.</p><p>Meanwhile, David Cameron effectively poised himself as a change leader who would end the chaos brought through the 2000s. As the past decade and the next came to clash, Cameron proved himself a winning bet as his party trounced over Blair's in a landslide—the final rebuke to the long-running Labour Party rule under Blair.</p><p><b>The Final Report Card</b></p><p>The election marked itself as a performance report for Prime Minister Tony Blair, a report which would come very negative for him and his party. Tony Blair would then concede, ending Labour's dominance and allowing a Conservative vision to take the 2010s by storm.</p>`)

<p><b>Statement of Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich (D–OH)</b></p><p><b>KUCINICH:</b></p><p>Mr. Speaker, last night, President Clark declared that our so-called mission in Afghanistan was done and accomplished. He spoke shiny words like "stability" and "peace" and finally came through on the promise he made long ago to the American people. The nation watched with bated breath as its President, after nine long years, finally set a withdrawal timeline. While I congratulate the President on his sudden moment of clarity and wish that he'd withdraw our troops immediately, I take some joy in the news.</p><p>Yet the era of American tyranny, rule by an iron fist, and rampant war crimes throughout the Middle East still rings valid upon the American mindset. The crime of taking weapons against these countries cannot be forgotten. The President may have come to a sudden realization that whoever he meets in the afterlife may not be so forgiving; his participation and, at times, acceleration of these crimes must not go unpunished.</p><p>Trillions of dollars wasted, thousands of American lives lost, and countless civilian casualties are a damning black spot over our long 234 years as a nation. If we fail to take responsibility for our mistakes, we will likely repeat them in the future. I welcome the President's pledge with open arms, but I will never shake hands with a tyrant, no matter how much he repents!</p><p>Therefore, I continue my motion to impeach President Wesley Kanne Clark. Those who fail to join me in repenting for our nation's sins will be remembered in the history books. Not as a shining beacon of truth but as a complicit coward unwilling to be bold enough to say no!</p><p>Some may ask if there is a current justification for impeachment, and I say to them, 'What is an impeachable offense?' If the killing of thousands of innocents throughout the Middle East is not one of them, I rebuke the sacred texts! It is time we move forward from the Founding Fathers' lack of preparation. It is time we find unity through accountability.</p><p>I yield back.</p>`)

That's how we got President Wesley Clark. Oh, you remember him? How could you not? He's on TV every day sporting his same PowerPoint patriotism and the promise of fixing American wars that won the day over that moron Bush.</p><p>It sounded good, right? "No more wars." "We'll finally finish the ones we got." "Fenito!"</p><p>So what does he do now after finally pulling us from Iraq? A big ole military U-turn sending more fresh meat—oh, I mean soldiers into Afghanistan to fight off an incoming Taliban resurgence. Oh, what you didn't hear about that? Well, that's because it doesn't exist! The Taliban is still just hiding in the mountains while America attempts to hold out in the longest staring contest ever before seen!</p><p>That's like robbing a bank and putting the money back nicely, only to walk into a second one wearing a bomb vest and screaming, "We got momentum now."</p><p>Oh, you want the reason? Stability, strategy, suicide vests, sand. Whatever it doesn't matter, we're in for the long haul, holding metal detectors over the desert, hoping to find the lucky pot of democracy Bush Jr. was so adamant about finding.</p><p>So President Clark, General Clark, Commander Clark, or whatever title he's parading around with this week, decided that we needed to go back to war, or else the war would travel across the Atlantic and beat us in a game of poker or something.</p><p>What I can tell you is that I'd rather focus on the wars I'm fighting here—fighting with Comcast and my damn landlord.</p><p>But hey, that's the American way we were all taught as young kids. We go to war for peace, we kill to protect human rights, and we drop democracy out of the back of a B-52.</p><p>Wesley Clark didn't change how we fought wars; he just found a way to make them look more pretty—by wearing stars and ribbons.</p>`)

<p>The Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research met yesterday by conference call. At its meeting, the committee determined a trough in business activity in the US economy in June 2010. The trough marks the end of the recession that began in December 2007 and the beginning of an expansion.</p><p>The recession's length exceeded most economists' expectations following the sudden collapse of General Motors due to Congressional deadlock, which prevented any economic bailout of these corporations. Just two of the many American financial institutions collapsed during the heat of the recession in 2008 and would later be followed by the collapse of AIG, "American International Group" in February 2009."</p><p>President Wesley Clark, frustrated by the lack of action, chastised Congress often following his reelection and made it his first priority to break the congressional deadlock, eventually breaking a deal of a 450 Billion stimulus bill that established the TARP program, which would be used to bail out Bank of America.</p><p>The committee's declaration of the end of a recession does not mean that the economy has recovered. Most institutions have yet to get back on their feet, and most families across America still feel the effects of the recession.</p><p>The declaration was followed by President Clark, who stated, "Economists may believe the recession has ended, but American families are still struggling to pay their bills day to day, and it's our job to offer more relief to the American people. The Republican Congress begs to differ, with most Republican leadership opposing further aid, citing the budget.</p><p>"Due to the lack of improvement in the labor market, particularly the stubbornly high unemployment rate, the recovery still feels like a recession to many households," said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research in New York.

<p><b>Updated March 4, 2011, 11:49 PM EST By NBC News</b></p> <p>President Clark's resurrection of the Home Owners Loan Corporation amid the 2008 financial crisis was a drastic solution, and to most at the time, it was necessary. The bill, which reestablished the corporation along with a 1.1 trillion dollar bailout, was put forward by Senator Hillary Clinton (New York) and was credited for the late surge in President Clark's re-election polling and eventual victory over his Republican opponent.</p><p>Today, the corporation accounts for nearly 15 percent of owner-occupied nonfarm mortgages. Many credit it as a necessary lifeline to millions of families across the United States.</p><p>However, Republican primary candidates feel much differently. Governor Rick Perry (Texas) has taken the lead in the discussion, blaming President Clark's "destructive homeownership policies" as the leading cause of the housing crisis. Other candidates like former Senator Rick Santorum, who ran in the 2008 Republican primaries, tend to agree. In particular, Santorum has been scrutinized after taking out a loan with the corporation himself when a tax assessment of his $2 million, five-acre home fell 25% in value. The former Senator's polling has dropped after the revelation came to light.</p><p>President Clark and the Democratic Party have stood by the corporation and hailed it as a success despite the sluggish economy. Vice President Landrieu has staked part of her presidential campaign on allowing the corporation to continue its work in the face of Republican calls to disband it.</p><p>As Democrats pick up the pieces of the steep losses during the midterms, the corporation's results have become a beacon of light for the party to coalesce around. It's hard to deny that the message "We kept you in your homes" isn't powerful. Republican deficit hawks claim billions of dollars are wasted within the corporation's work, but polls show at least 55% of Americans approve of the Home Owners Loan Corporation, while 39% disapprove and 6% are unsure.</p>`)

<p><b>By Erick Erickson</b></p><p><b>July 2, 2012</b></p><p>How long does it take someone to finish grieving their loved ones? Apparently, for recently widowed Senator John Edwards, it's not long at all. Mary Elizabeth Anania Edwards dedicated her life both to political activism and her family, and the announcement that a sitting senator's wife now had cancer was among the reasons why John Edwards would keep his seat comfortably in the 2010 midterms. Just months after winning another term in the Senate, John Edwards would say his final goodbyes to his loving wife in their home. </p><p>The people of North Carolina and America as a whole grieved for the Senator's wife, but since then, a noticeable abnormality has presented itself. Not since the days of John F. Kennedy Jr. have media outlets placed such a focus on a bachelor's stardom. Vogue Magazine and plenty of other news pundits describe John Edwards as "America's Most Popular Bachelor." Such disrespect to a widow's family would usually be met with harsh denunciation, but what's worse is that Senator Edwards appears to be playing into it.</p><p>Rumors spread that Edwards had found a new girlfriend just one year after his wife's passing. Now, everyone grieves differently at their own pace, but the death of Senator Edwards' wife appears to have only been a footnote in his life. Now, the Democratic nominee for President of the United States, Edwards, has waved the flag of sympathy for his late wife around like a trophy. Every time he mentions her, he looks more relieved than sorrowful. </p><p>Online social media platforms have taken a different approach to confronting Edwards' behavior. A popular YouTube video has done the rounds on various social media accounts of John Edwards' face superimposed on top of footage of James Sunderland in a video game called Silent Hill. The game follows James Sunderland, a recent widower who smothered his dying wife, Mary, with a pillow due to the physical burden of catering to her illness. The connection is hard not to put together.</p><p>President Bush has smartly refused to comment on any allegations relating to his opponents' love life. It doesn't take the President to point out what's obvious to the rest of us. John Edwards didn't love his wife; if he did, he wouldn't have left her memory in the dust or kicked her tragic fate around like a political football.</p>`)

<p><b>u/libertarians</b></p><p><b>u/mayoforsam</b></p> <p>I know it's a tired joke, but seriously, where the hell is Mike Pence? I'm starting to miss the days when I could turn on my TV to watch President Giuliani's press conferences, where Pence would fan him with a giant feather while Condi fed him fruits until he'd occasionally answer a question about the invasion of Libya.</p><p> It was good entertainment hearing the president bring up 9/11 while justifying why we needed to bulldoze another random country. So what happened? Where's the shop bitch of the White House?</p><p>Secretary Rice is the one we get to see the most since she's the one busy covering for Giuliani's ass. All those failures in Libya? Benghazi? Please, Giuliani is a celebrity posing as the "acting president" now. Anyone with a brain and two working eyes can see that given State Department goon, John Kerry is the Democrat's pick for president, it's obvious that Rudy's incompetent foreign agenda has brought back old feuds.</p><p>This is a battle of foreign policy intellect, and Condoleezza Rice is in the hot seat, facing off against low approval ratings and Kerry being a popular face of the State Department. The media haven't picked up the sidelining of Pence, but it's pretty clear that his role in the administration is slowly being diminished in favor of laying the groundwork for President Rice's third term in 2016.</p><p>I wouldn't be confident in her shoes since most issues give Kerry the upper hand because Giuliani's inept economic policies have done nothing for American families.</p><p>Still, I'll be kicking up my feet no matter which deep-state puppet wins. Don't blame me; I'm voting for Randall Terry.</p>`)

e.pages.push(`<h3>Politico: <i>Three primaries are in, and President Paul has failed to take one</i></h3>
<p><b>Jack Wells</b></p> <p>President Ron Paul's tenure in the Oval Office has become nothing short of disastrous for the Republican Party. From the downward spiral of an economic recession to a full-scale depression, the task put on his shoulders would never be easy. This isn't to say that he hadn't dug his own political grave somewhat. From the collapse of banks nationwide and the eventual axing of key government programs and agencies, his name soon became political poison as Republicans down-ballot attempted to run away from the political landfall of his collapsing mandate.</p><p>Following the disastrous midterms, among the first to announce their intentions to stop President Paul's renomination was House Minority Leader Eric Cantor. Running on a promise to return the Republican Party to "responsible conservativism," his announcement seemingly opened the door for a whole band of kooks and nuts. Most surprising was the entrance of now-fired General Stanley McChrystal, who ran on a promise of returning the United States to NATO.</p><p>President Paul shifted focus on reelection soon after declaring his intentions to run as a Republican again. However, as the campaign began, attacks came down on his rule from every angle. Cantor focused on fiscal irresponsibility, McChrystal concentrated on foreign policy failures, and former Judge Roy Moore went after Paul for his social libertarianism. When the major candidates came to blows at Iowa, Paul suffered a humiliating first defeat at the hands of McChrystal, who beat him in the suffering farm state by nearly 6 points. The President continued his quest to keep the presidency but would soon be shockingly defeated in New Hampshire, falling third place behind Cantor and McChrystal.</p><p>Following two defeats, his chances looked especially grim as South Carolina quickly approached. Moore, who focused heavily on winning the state, led polls by 3 points over McChrystal, while Paul trailed by over 6%. Polls proved correct as Moore took the state by storm while Paul continued to rant about his party's betrayal.</p><p>So, where does this campaign move from here? Many have floated ideas, such as Paul relinquishing part of his administration to the establishment and possibly even dropping Vice President Johnson to claw back support. However, one door remained open on Paul's path until November 6th. Paul has refused to state whether he'd consider running independent if he failed to get renominated by the Republican Party. If he were to go down this route, he'd almost assuredly be throwing the election to former President Wesley Clark, who has seemingly become the frontrunner of the Democratic Primaries after beating Sanders in New Hampshire and South Carolina.</p><p><b>Related Articles</b></p><span style="color:blue;"><u>Clark and Landrieu again or is the former president looking for new blood?</span></u> (March 4th 2012)<br><span style="color:blue;"><u>Libertarian Party pledges support for the President will he run with them?</span></u> (Feb 11th 2012)<br><span style="color:blue;"><u>Vice President Johnson noticeably tired at press briefing.</span></u> (March 1st 2012)</p>`)

<p><b>SAINT PAUL, MINNESOTA– During his latest campaign rally, President Huckabee announced that in his next term, he plans to force Muslim-Americans to identify themselves by wearing a star and crescent patch that will be stitched onto their clothing. According to Huckabee, “The Islamic religion will have to adapt itself to sound constructive activity as other nations do, or sooner or later it will succumb to a crisis of an inconceivable magnitude.” This statement was widely praised in the mainstream media, with the New York Times describing Huckabee’s statement as “tough love which Muslims would do well to appreciate.” In an appearance on Fox News held the day after the rally, Huckabee expanded on his plans further, saying that “After we have the badges, I think it would be for the best if we built areas where Muslims can concentrate. Of course, we would want this to be as easy as possible for them, so we could build train lines right up to these concentration… places, even try to spruce these areas up with amenities like fences and showers. At press time, sources with Democrat Keith Ellison’s campaign confirmed that Ellison had criticized Huckabee’s statements, but that nobody had bothered to listen to him.</b></p>`)

<p><b>Posted on JournalFreedom, October 2012</b></p><p>Sometimes, Washington takes pointers from secret tapes of Yeltsin & Co in the 90s. I can't think of any other good reason why the Americans would copy our glorious circus act from then to elect their leaders now.</p><p><b>Don't be afraid to observe it for yourself.</b></p><p>In one corner, you have the President of the United States, the all too lovable international teddy bear who runs America like his personal oil company. He could be any provincial oligarch running in Belarus, Ukraine, or Moldova. 1996 was a grim, cold, and unforgiving year, much like the scenario that presented itself within America's borders.</p><p>In the other corner stands Rod Blagojevich, Governor of Illinois, the state that hasn't caught a glimpse of hope through the layered atmosphere of corruption. A man caught selling government contracts to former governments as if it were a dacha outside Moscow. And this man seriously thinks he can be President.</p><p>The Americans, of course, deluded themselves. They pretend that what we observe now is a model for free and fair elections, but as I read this campaign's developments, I'm oddly reminiscent. It's a lot like reading the Kommersant in 1995; endless scandals, back-room deals, dark money flooding the system, and every candidate posing as the nation's sole savior.</p><p>The irony of listening to journalists hail Blagojevich with straight faces while he talks about bringing "honesty" and "transparency" back to government is that it's as absurd as Boris Yeltsin claiming he's sober. Rod isn't a stranger to clownish appeals to anti-corruption messaging; he's run on stopping others from putting their hands in the cookie jar since his first stint in politics. The difference is that he's stopping others so he can get his hand in there and eat away at his country's hope.</p><p>Ordinary Americans are caught in the same limbo we once confronted. They grumble in their kitchens while the breadwinner takes home less and less cash, and the price of their groceries continues to rise. The only noticeable difference is that they drown their sorrows with less vodka and more television.</p><p>So, yes, I'm thankful that Russia found its groove and moved on from the political death march Yeltsin led us through. I extend my most heartfelt prayers to our American friends as they follow suit.</p><p><b>P.S. Cheney will win. The system, billionaires, and deep state operatives have coalesced around his reelection bid. I am so disappointed that America will not experience a term or two of Blagojevich. He'd show what the rest of the world already knew. The 1990s weren't a golden age; they were nauseating. Just because American media companies chose to ignore that, it doesn't mean it didn't happen.</b></p>`)

I cannot begin to describe the joy that fills my heart as I introduce the man after me, but let me say a few things before I go.</p><p>Four years ago, I watched a bold and successful president lead the country through its darkest hour since 9/11, and I understood that even after all my party had done, we were fighting an uphill battle. Although President Clark fought hard and valiantly for the American people, we would lose. </p><p>The slim glimmer of hope that I had for the incoming President was that he knew what he was doing, that he would fight for the millions of Americans who lost their jobs, those who lost their homes. Instead, President Rudy Giuliani ignored the signs that desperate federal action was needed. We got a show, press conferences framed like television drama, foreign policy communicated through opera! The lights were bright and dazzling in Washington, while Main Street remained in the dark.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, politics is not reality TV; leadership is about ratings, and the presidency shouldn't be run for television's sake, but for the nation's health.</p><p>Yet here we are tonight, together again, united as a new and bold Democratic Party that understands that politics is less about showing off and more about getting work done.</p><p>Now I know the man I'm about to introduce is very familiar to you whether you've seen him on the big screen or walking down the red carpet but let me tell you after raising him, watching him grow up in Kentucky, there's no one I believe in more than his ability to reconnect America to reality, not reality TV, but the real world!</p><p>I've watched him take the values of justice, compassion, and respect outside Hollywood to help states in need and advocate for people forgotten by this administration. The thousands of Haitian immigrants that the Giuliani administration has left in camps are violating their human rights!</p><p>He is twice the man that President Giuliani could ever hope to be, and tonight he is our nominee for President of the United States.</p><p>So let me finish with this, as both your colleague and a father. If you want a president who puts country over ratings, compassion over showmanship, and justice over callousness, please welcome your soon-to-be 46th President of these United States, George Clooney!"</p><p><b>(Thunderous Applause follows as the camera pans toward George Clooney taking the stage.)</b></p>`)

<p><b>October 17, 2012 – Denver, CO</b></p><p>During what many assumed would be a standard foreign policy segment of the presidential debate broadcast, Senator Jim Webb made a fiery remark about President Giuliani that even had the debate moderator taken aback. While discussing the war in Libya, the President defended his decision to put boots on the ground, and Webb quipped, "Mr. President you play the macho role very well but below the swagger and night rider shades you're a sissy incapable of good leadership."</p><p>The room fell silent, and even President Giuliani stood dumbfounded, unable to respond. When Marth Raddatz asked for clarification, Webb doubled down, saying, "look I won't mince words, if the President wants to stand there and cry I ask him to do the same for every son and daughter that comes home in a casket because he decided to throw more bodies across the world!"</p><p>After more deafening silence, Giuliani cleared his throat and said the following: "Look I am not going to take such disrespectful language lying down and furthermore my heart aches for every soldier we lose but their sacrifice keeps us safe!" The defense seemingly set Senator Webb off who would interject saying "listen Mr. President, unlike you, I've been in the shoes of those worried that their family members may not come home and when I tell you I've just about had it with listening to comments like you justify the deaths of thousands of Americans by jingling the keys of terror I mean it." The heated exchange became the headlines for the press the next morning, with most chastising Webb for taking the debate into the gutter. </p><p>Webb, a decorated Marine, spent his career with the spirited advocacy against the Iraq War on behalf of his son, who was serving at the time. It's no surprise for Webb to come out so strongly against military action in Libya, but the directness in his hatred for the President has always been a hallmark of his personality. Webb calls it like it is and isn't afraid to upset people with his language. </p><p>Someone who came at Webb hard for the remarks was Senator Lindsey Graham, who stated that "name calling and foul language has no place in politics." Instead of making an apology, Webb poured more gas on the fire by coming at Graham for being too "ladylike and soft."</p><p>Privately, Republican staffers reportedly witnessed the president "rattled" by Webb's comments, as polls show Giuliani's credibility on the war on terror ever decreasing, regardless of the scandal. What some find to be a shameful smear, others may discover enlightening about their President's weaknesses on the world stage. </p><p>The Webb campaign is attempting to shift the narrative, and while Republicans' talking points continue to rail against such harsh language, the public conscience may respond differently.</p>`)

<p><b>By The Progressive Editorial Staff</b></p><p><b>October 12, 2011</b></p><p>History is often cruel when it looks back at men who assumed insurmountable power and influence. If one were to look back at John McCain in a time when he hadn't secured an electoral victory against Wesley Clark, then perhaps he'd be seen as a visionary bipartisan figure, where such political luxuries were fading away. We don't live in such a world where his promise of a straight talk agenda didn't see action. Instead, we get the agenda from the mouth of a hospitalized president, and the words spoken to a CNN reporter, "Assad must go," cannot be overlooked so easily.</p><p>According to aides at the scene, the president, in between drifting back and forth from consciousness, was under heavy medication, which grabbed the reporter's wrist, whispering such words that an international firestorm would burst from while he slept.</p><p>It is telling, if unsurprising, that even when his body failed him, his head was pointing instinctively toward another Middle Eastern conflict. Ignoring that Syria had never attacked the United States and how similarly this rings to the words spoken by Bush on Saddam's fate in Iraq, this is the intention of a warmongering administration that Wesley Clark warned against. </p><p>White House Chief of Staff John Bolten referred to the remarks as "a reflection, not policy." Yet by Monday morning, anonymous leaks from the administration told another tale. Pentagon officials are confirmed to have planned some strikes within Syria and tabling "other options," one report found. Lobbyists, think tank warriors, and Lockheed Martin stock traders are salivating at the chance to fund another criminal war. The playbook is underway, and it's up to the American people to dismiss the blatant war drumming.</p><p>McCain, like many Republicans, sees the world as a game of battleships. To him, every new strong man is the next 9/11 waiting to happen, and it's his top priority to kick down his doors and carpet bomb his cities. If civilian life within the Middle East were on the menu of the American fast food industrial complex, John McCain would jump at the opportunity to sink his teeth into it. The rest of us are forced to sit on the sidelines as administration priorities take precedence, forgetting healthcare, the struggling economy, and national dignity. The Republican Party is no longer trying to steal your future quietly; they're pickpocketing you in broad daylight, and the American people are forced to just gawk and scream in hopes that the Democrats finally get their shit together.</p><p>Progressives must resist the temptation to treat McCain's words as harmless ramblings. While Vice President Lieberman takes the role of acting president as an opportunity to get the wheels spinning on a special operation in Syria, it's up to us to get out in the streets, joining hands to protest a rogue administration.</p><p>The real whisper of America's needs is a different sound. The calling of healthcare for all, jobs with purpose, and affordability for everyone. If the President believes Assad must go, then we must shout that endless wars must go.</p>`)

<p>The stage is set for activist Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher, commonly known as "Joe The Plumber," and Daniel Jacob Jackson, also known as "Dan The Mechanic," to settle their ongoing public feud in a publicized boxing match this Tuesday at 8 PM in what some are calling the race to prove who looks like the bigger jackass in a plaid flannel. The two are set to spar both rhetorically and physically.</p><p><b>Where it all began.</b></p><p>Samuel Wurzelbacher gained celebrity status in 2008 after joining in on the chorus lamenting rising taxes on small businesses and economic uncertainty. The Romney/Palin campaign capitalized on such worries by echoing those same concerns, which would eventually propel them to victory in November's presidential election. Mr. Wurzelbacher wasn't keen on being a temporary sideshow on the national scene, so he continued speaking for the blue-collar Republican voters and campaigned for several Ohio Republicans, including former Representative John Kasich, who unsuccessfully challenged Ohio Governor Ted Strickland in 2010. </p><p>Daniel Jackson, a fellow Ohio native, became a national star after the Romney administration refused to bail out several automobile manufacturing companies throughout the Midwest. Mr. Jackson lost his job in 2009 and became a public speaker, often chastising the Romney administration for "abandoning the working people." In what would be a significant shift in the 2020 elections, Daniel Jackson, along with many other pro-working-class activists, would help drive the Democratic Party to substantial victories, such as unseating Wisconsin's Republican Governor Scott Walker and flipping Ohio's Senate Seat. </p><p><b>What is the Feud?</b></p><p>The controversy started when Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (ODJFS) employees and Ohio officials searched Joe Wurzelbacher's government records after he became a national icon. Since then, he has launched several attacks on the Democratic Party, now led by Strickland's presidential candidacy, with the popular label "Party Of Witch Hunts" being his most frequently used phrase while hitting the campaign trail. Mr. Jackson was caught on a hot mic calling Wurzelbacher a "baby man," always complaining about trivial problems, while the rest of the working class suffered.</p><p><b>The Big Players</b></p><p>Ted Strickland, Ohio's 68th governor, is everything you imagine when you think of your small-town uncle with an RV. With a posture ready to cut down trees and a haircut older than your kids. His candidacy embodies the working class, as does his manner of expression, which is often interrupted by his attempts to explain how to replace your brakes.</p><p>Mitt Romney, the 45th President of the United States, could have been created in a lab with the prompt of "successful white collar dad." Complete with the speaking mannerisms of someone still saying the words "away dang it!" Mitt is every American's Ken Doll, and just like Mattel, he's always trying to sell you something.</p><p>It's a classic matchup of the blue-collar working class versus the white-collar suits and ties.</p><p><b>How it Affects You.</b></p><p>With the 2012 election underway, many had held hope that President Romney's national unity governance strategy would translate into an election fitting such action. However, Strickland's "tough but fair" campaign style often goes to the throat of Romney for telling the working class to "drop dead."</p><p>The Romney campaign isn't absolved of blame either. Vice President Sarah Palin, angling for the future President in waiting position, has often made similar partisan strikes at the Democratic Party. Her style sometimes resorts to personal attacks on Strickland, as seen in a gaffe during a CNN interview, where she claimed that Strickland's big "tough guy" routine was compensating for something "lacking down under." While she'd eventually apologize for such remarks, it further drove a wedge between the President and his 'no funny business' moniker. </p><p>It's safe to say that the era of bipartisanship and above-the-table tactics is quickly eroding, whether it's political attacks on one's genitals or physical boxing matches to prove one's point.</p>`)

<p><b>By Erick Erickson</b></p><p><b>July 2, 2012</b></p><p>How long does it take someone to finish grieving their loved ones? Apparently, for recently widowed Senator John Edwards, it's not long at all. Mary Elizabeth Anania Edwards dedicated her life both to political activism and her family, and the announcement that a sitting senator's wife now had cancer was among the reasons why John Edwards would keep his seat comfortably in the 2010 midterms. Just months after winning another term in the Senate, John Edwards would say his final goodbyes to his loving wife in their home. </p><p>The people of North Carolina and America as a whole grieved for the Senator's wife, but since then, a noticeable abnormality has presented itself. Not since the days of John F. Kennedy Jr. have media outlets placed such a focus on a bachelor's stardom. Vogue Magazine and plenty of other news pundits describe John Edwards as "America's Most Popular Bachelor." Such disrespect to a widow's family would usually be met with harsh denunciation, but what's worse is that Senator Edwards appears to be playing into it.</p><p>Rumors spread that Edwards had found a new girlfriend just one year after his wife's passing. Now, everyone grieves differently at their own pace, but the death of Senator Edwards' wife appears to have only been a footnote in his life. Now, the Democratic nominee for President of the United States, Edwards, has waved the flag of sympathy for his late wife around like a trophy. Every time he mentions her, he looks more relieved than sorrowful. </p><p>Online social media platforms have taken a different approach to confronting Edwards' behavior. A popular YouTube video has done the rounds on various social media accounts of John Edwards' face superimposed on top of footage of James Sunderland in a video game called Silent Hill. The game follows James Sunderland, a recent widower who smothered his dying wife, Mary, with a pillow due to the physical burden of catering to her illness. The connection is hard not to put together.</p><p>President Bush has smartly refused to comment on any allegations relating to his opponents' love life. It doesn't take the President to point out what's obvious to the rest of us. John Edwards didn't love his wife; if he did, he wouldn't have left her memory in the dust or kicked her tragic fate around like a political football.</p>`)

However, following extensive investigations into Paul’s death from the FBI and RCMP, his cause of death has officially been changed from “political assassination” to “collateral damage.”</p><p>The facts of Paul’s death are indisputable: at a meeting between him and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, held in Hawaii, Bauer fired seven shots, two of which hit Paul in the head and killed him instantly; the Secret Service killed Bauer on the spot. Investigations into Bauer and his motives soon uncovered that he was married to a Latvian-American woman, Brigita Ozolina Bauer, who is a card-carrying member of the far-right All for Latvia! party. Investigations into Bauer’s online history revealed a multitude of complaints against Paul’s withdrawal from NATO, which he blamed for the Russian annexation of Latgale and the overthrow of the Latvian government. As the logic went, Bauer, infuriated by Russia’s advances into the Baltics due to his personal connection with his wife, blamed Paul for the events and killed him in retribution. The case was quickly closed and Brigita Ozolina Bauer was released without charges.</p><p>Then, two months after the investigation concluded, a moderator on an online forum contacted the RCMP, claiming that he had uncovered Bauer’s account. Investigators were quickly able to verify the account as indeed belonging to Bauer, and were shocked to learn that on the forum, he had explained his plans for the assassination in detail. However, rather than Bauer planning to assassinate Paul, he had actually been aiming to assassinate Chad Kroeger, the lead singer of the band Nickelback. </p><p>As it turned out, Bauer described himself as having a “special level of disgust” towards Nickelback, one of the most hated bands on the planet, citing their “nonexistent rhythms and awful melodies.” For a period of six months, Bauer openly joked about killing Kroger, sending messages such as “Just woke up today thinking of how nice it would be if CHAD’S FUCKING BRAINS WERE BLOWN OUT” and “I hate that shitty band. #killurselfchad, jk, i’m going to do it myself.” Other users on the site openly egged him on, believing that Bauer’s threats were simply a joke typical of the normal internet hate towards the band, with posts such as “Hate myself for being Canadian like those Nickelback pieces of shit” garnering many positive responses. Rather, he was putting together a real-life plan to assassinate Kroeger. </p><p>In an online piece entitled “Look at this Manifesto,” published to the forum 24 minutes before the fatal shooting, Bauer outlined his plans to kill Kroeger, who was set to put on a brief performance at the summit between Harper and Paul held in Honolulu’s J.W. Marriott Hotel. Bauer, who lived in Honolulu and was intimately familiar with the Marriott, had identified an alcove in the hotel’s roof where he could get a clear shot as Kroeger, completely undetectable to security forces. Bauer had initially planned to shoot Kroger during his performance, but seeing as how the singer was moving too much during the show, Bauer instead opted to shoot Kroeger while the summit itself was taking place, with Kroeger seated almost directly behind Paul. In the piece, Bauer even explicitly made sure to note his lack of desire to kill Paul or Harper, nothing that “cops will be all over me if I kill a head of state… have to aim true so that I can only eliminate the target.” Despite this, two of Bauer’s seven shots hit Paul’s head, one grazed Harper across the shoulder, and four missed Kroeger’s head by six inches.</p><p>Speaking on the investigation’s results from the Oval Office, President Gary Johnson proclaimed himself “aghast” at the findings, stating that “while President Paul’s death was a tragedy no matter what way you look at it, to go out by accident in such a farcical way leaves an extra bitter taste in the mouth. I’m sure all of our prayers are with his family as they grieve and deal with this new information.” In the same appearance, Johnson reiterated that he had no intent to rejoin NATO, saying that the “revelations of Paul’s death, as tragic as they may be, only confirm that leaving NATO was not the loss that everyone says it is. Respecting his decision to exit is the best way to honor his memory.”</p>`)

<p><b>Rich Mims</b></p><p><b>Daily Inter Lake</b></p><p><b>November 8, 2012</b></p><p><b>LAKESIDE, MONTANA–</b> Ben Garrison, a political cartoonist and illustrator who rose to prominence in 2010 for his deep-seated admiration for President Ron Paul, was found dead in his home in Lakeside, Montana from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Garrison, who died at age 55, was found at home by his wife Tina, who had left the house to run errands.</p><p>Garrison, who was raised in Washington and Texas, received a B.A. in art before working as an artist for the San Angelo Standard Times and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer before moving to Montana in 2009. Garrison, who considered himself a libertarian and voted for Ron Paul in 2008, began drawing politician cartoons shortly after his move to Montana, inspired by the “negative perception of Ron Paul in the media.” Garrison began posting political cartoons on his website and on political message boards.</p><p>Garrison’s political cartoons, which followed a general libertarian and right-wing theme, often made references to conspiracy theories and fringe politics, with various commentators describing them as sexist, racist, anti-feminist, xenophobic, anti-government, and anti-semitic. Garrison had a noted love of President Paul, however, whom he often depicted as an extremely vibrant, strong, muscular fighter in contrast to the real-life Paul’s advanced age and normal build.</p><p>In 2010, Garrison attracted national attention for his cartoon entitled “Tyranny of the Minority,” depicting Republican Maine Senator Olympia Snowe and Democratic Illinois Senator Dick Durbin stabbing President Paul in the back while dressed in togas, inside a Roman-style building with the words “Global Elitist Headquarters” written on it. The cartoon was posted thousands of times on the internet and was even covered by mainstream news outlets, who noted the humorous level of agony on Paul’s face. Following the success of the cartoon, Garrison was able to focus on political cartooning full-time, even scoring an invite to the White House and a personal meeting with Paul in 2011.</p><p>In the months leading up to Garrison’s death, he often expressed deep anxiety over the prospect of an Obama presidency, and donated a substantial amount of money to the Montana Republican Party to unsuccessfully keep Obama from flipping the state. In the days leading up to his death, Garrison’s comics became more extreme and conspiratorial, with Garrison insisting that a Paul reelection was the only way to avoid a national catastrophe, with his wife claiming that Garrison had a mental breakdown on Election Day after Obama’s landslide 14-point victory.</p><p>At the moment, Lakeside police are ruling Garrison’s death a suicide, pointing to the ballistic results showing no evidence of foul play and a lengthy suicide note next to Garrison’s body matching his handwriting, in which he claimed that he could not live any more due to the prospect of an “African globalist” winning the presidency and his “brave Texan knight” being defeated. Garrison’s wife has set up a link to fund his funeral on his personal website, as well as a thank-you message to his fans.</p>`)

<p><b>Jack Wells</b></p> <p>President Ron Paul's tenure in the Oval Office has become nothing short of disastrous for the Republican Party. From the downward spiral of an economic recession to a full-scale depression, the task put on his shoulders would never be easy. This isn't to say that he hadn't dug his own political grave somewhat. From the collapse of banks nationwide and the eventual axing of key government programs and agencies, his name soon became political poison as Republicans down-ballot attempted to run away from the political landfall of his collapsing mandate.</p><p>Following the disastrous midterms, among the first to announce their intentions to stop President Paul's renomination was House Minority Leader Eric Cantor. Running on a promise to return the Republican Party to "responsible conservativism," his announcement seemingly opened the door for a whole band of kooks and nuts. Most surprising was the entrance of now-fired General Stanley McChrystal, who ran on a promise of returning the United States to NATO.</p><p>President Paul shifted focus on reelection soon after declaring his intentions to run as a Republican again. However, as the campaign began, attacks came down on his rule from every angle. Cantor focused on fiscal irresponsibility, McChrystal concentrated on foreign policy failures, and former Judge Roy Moore went after Paul for his social libertarianism. When the major candidates came to blows at Iowa, Paul suffered a humiliating first defeat at the hands of McChrystal, who beat him in the suffering farm state by nearly 6 points. The President continued his quest to keep the presidency but would soon be shockingly defeated in New Hampshire, falling third place behind Cantor and McChrystal.</p><p>Following two defeats, his chances looked especially grim as South Carolina quickly approached. Moore, who focused heavily on winning the state, led polls by 3 points over McChrystal, while Paul trailed by over 6%. Polls proved correct as Moore took the state by storm while Paul continued to rant about his party's betrayal.</p><p>So, where does this campaign move from here? Many have floated ideas, such as Paul relinquishing part of his administration to the establishment and possibly even dropping Vice President Johnson to claw back support. However, one door remained open on Paul's path until November 6th. Paul has refused to state whether he'd consider running independent if he failed to get renominated by the Republican Party. If he were to go down this route, he'd almost assuredly be throwing the election to former President Wesley Clark, who has seemingly become the frontrunner of the Democratic Primaries after beating Sanders in New Hampshire and South Carolina.</p><p><b>Related Articles</b></p><span style="color:blue;"><u>Clark and Landrieu again or is the former president looking for new blood?</span></u> (March 4th 2012)<br><span style="color:blue;"><u>Libertarian Party pledges support for the President will he run with them?</span></u> (Feb 11th 2012)<br><span style="color:blue;"><u>Vice President Johnson noticeably tired at press briefing.</span></u> (March 1st 2012)</p>`)

<p><b>SAINT PAUL, MINNESOTA– During his latest campaign rally, President Huckabee announced that in his next term, he plans to force Muslim-Americans to identify themselves by wearing a star and crescent patch that will be stitched onto their clothing. According to Huckabee, “The Islamic religion will have to adapt itself to sound constructive activity as other nations do, or sooner or later it will succumb to a crisis of an inconceivable magnitude.” This statement was widely praised in the mainstream media, with the New York Times describing Huckabee’s statement as “tough love which Muslims would do well to appreciate.” In an appearance on Fox News held the day after the rally, Huckabee expanded on his plans further, saying that “After we have the badges, I think it would be for the best if we built areas where Muslims can concentrate. Of course, we would want this to be as easy as possible for them, so we could build train lines right up to these concentration… places, even try to spruce these areas up with amenities like fences and showers. At press time, sources with Democrat Keith Ellison’s campaign confirmed that Ellison had criticized Huckabee’s statements, but that nobody had bothered to listen to him.</b></p>`)

<p><b>By Jaywon Brian, Washington Post, 6/7/2013</b></p><p>If corruption had a mirror image, the silhouette of the ever-deteriorating General Michael T. Flynn would appear in it. General Flynn's "Savior" government has further darkened after state prosecutors unsealed an indictment against Brooklyn Borough President and key Flynn advisor, Eric Adams. The indictment alleged that he accepted bribes from Turkish business interests looking to get a nod from the regime.</p><p>Adams, the former police captain who rose to prominence as a voice of reason and hope amid the country's economic descent into oblivion. He stands as the most prominent member of Flynn's inner circle that have undergone prosecutorial upheaval, as the indictment alleges that he funneled Turkish money through various charities and political foundations in exchange for city contracts.</p><p>The indictment hits the administration as the latest chapter, presenting General Flynn's government with new and more problematic tests. Flynn came to power amid a Congressional standoff between Democrats looking to put an end to the Brownback tax experiment and Republicans still marching like zombies to its defense. A gridlock that caused the government to shut down for over two months until General Flynn made history during his march on Washington, where he ousted Brownback & Co. A seizure justified not by law, but by necessity, as major cities nationwide fell into anarchy.</p><p>Other Flynn Allies came under suspicion, according to court documents, as a spree of real estate deals, energy contracts, and favorable visas was revealed to have taken place, involving over five regime officials.</p><p>"The Turkish government is like a loanshark to this government," said Former Governor and staunch Flynn critic Jesse Ventura. "Flynn promised to bring accountability back to government and undo the damage President Brownback did, what a fraud."</p><p>White House officials insist that President Flynn took no part in the affairs of Eric Adams and that he is committed "to rooting out corruption wherever it may lie." However, critics argue that the indictment of such a close friend, who is often seen with Flynn planning similar infrastructure projects throughout New York, highlights the close connection between this scandal.</p><p>Former President Wesley Clark also came under fire for defending Flynn amid a scandal of his own plaguing an investment firm that he chairs. Rodman & Renshaw is under investigation by the FEC for allegations of fraud stemming from the firm's ties to Chinese companies. </p><p><b>For Flynn</b>, the case is especially damaging as questions of his own conduct in relation to Turkey further hamper his attempt to establish an era of "normalcy" that he promised. With unemployment stubbornly high and infrastructure further deteriorating, the corruption cases serve only to disillusion the American public further.</p><p><b>As for Adams</b>, his trial is set to begin early next year, and he has used this time to vigorously defend himself against the state charges publicly. "I have and always will act in the best interests of New York, and trust me, I know that our best interests demand that I fight these baseless attacks. I will never back down," said Adams.</p>`)

e.pages.push(`<h3>Opinion | <i>The Case Against Dennis Kucinich </i></h3>
<p><b>By Elise Pamela </b></p><p><b>The Washington Post</b></p><p>When a crisis strikes, we recognize that actions once thought unthinkable become necessary. Once confronted by a threat of foreign collusion, the face of terror itself, President Richard Cheney couldn't fail to act. Federal agents detained Congressman Dennis Kucinich amid administration findings that he had "accepted bribes from Syrian Dictator Bashar al-Assad." In a moment where unity is paramount, the president acted swiftly.</p><p>Kucinich often found himself on the opposite side of history from his colleagues, a long pariah with the political system. His unorthodox campaign for president ventured from proposals of a Department of Peace, the immediate withdrawal from all foreign conflicts, and most of all, the arrest of Dick Cheney. While critics decry Kucinich's arrest as the end of freedom itself, such luxury often led the nation down the wrong path. In the original Patriot Act's absence, terror rose from the dead and destabilized all within its grasp. Cheney's actions kept the nation on course.</p><p>Some may object to the arrest, others may claim it's a political witch hunt, maybe so, but the risk involved in letting Kucinich run amok of American politics is too much to bear. The possibility of him infecting American culture with orders sent from terrorists and dictators with the help of the Democratic Party's elevation of him toward the nomination of the presidency is a threat to our national security. If the hand of government seems heavy, we must never forget it is to protect.</p><p>Americans must remain cautious, as does the Democratic Party, which allowed a political abnormality to ascend the party ranks. The inaction of cooler heads within their court must be reprimanded for allowing Kucinich to get this far. How dare they let the votes be free and fair if not to destroy the security of our nation? Obstructionist-in-Chief Tom Daschle learned a harsh lesson two years ago that his work to impede the thirst for safety would be punished. He finds himself without a seat at the table, as will the Ohio Congressman.</p><p>The Conservative stewardship of our press, much like the takeover of our democracy, acts as an anchor in stormy waters. President Cheney carefully guides us through harsh times, even if his enemies rightfully villainize him. </p><p>Yet we asked Kucinich to comment on his imprisonment, and he issued the following statement:</p><p><b>First, they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a socialist.</b></p><p><b>Then they came for the union workers, and I did not speak out—because I was not a union worker.</b></p><p><b>Then they came for the muslims, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Muslim.</b></p><p><b>Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.</b></p><p>Kucinich wrote as an obvious spin of a quote by Martin Niemöller. </p><p>Whether the congressman is released or kept in custody remains to be seen, but in sum, Cheney's actions demonstrate his firm approach to security. Label the tactics as you see fit; the result is a positive indication that terror no longer has a place in America.</p>`)

<p><b>Posted on JournalFreedom, October 2012</b></p><p>Sometimes, Washington takes pointers from secret tapes of Yeltsin & Co in the 90s. I can't think of any other good reason why the Americans would copy our glorious circus act from then to elect their leaders now.</p><p><b>Don't be afraid to observe it for yourself.</b></p><p>In one corner, you have the President of the United States, the all too lovable international teddy bear who runs America like his personal oil company. He could be any provincial oligarch running in Belarus, Ukraine, or Moldova. 1996 was a grim, cold, and unforgiving year, much like the scenario that presented itself within America's borders.</p><p>In the other corner stands Rod Blagojevich, Governor of Illinois, the state that hasn't caught a glimpse of hope through the layered atmosphere of corruption. A man caught selling government contracts to former governments as if it were a dacha outside Moscow. And this man seriously thinks he can be President.</p><p>The Americans, of course, deluded themselves. They pretend that what we observe now is a model for free and fair elections, but as I read this campaign's developments, I'm oddly reminiscent. It's a lot like reading the Kommersant in 1995; endless scandals, back-room deals, dark money flooding the system, and every candidate posing as the nation's sole savior.</p><p>The irony of listening to journalists hail Blagojevich with straight faces while he talks about bringing "honesty" and "transparency" back to government is that it's as absurd as Boris Yeltsin claiming he's sober. Rod isn't a stranger to clownish appeals to anti-corruption messaging; he's run on stopping others from putting their hands in the cookie jar since his first stint in politics. The difference is that he's stopping others so he can get his hand in there and eat away at his country's hope.</p><p>Ordinary Americans are caught in the same limbo we once confronted. They grumble in their kitchens while the breadwinner takes home less and less cash, and the price of their groceries continues to rise. The only noticeable difference is that they drown their sorrows with less vodka and more television.</p><p>So, yes, I'm thankful that Russia found its groove and moved on from the political death march Yeltsin led us through. I extend my most heartfelt prayers to our American friends as they follow suit.</p><p><b>P.S. Cheney will win. The system, billionaires, and deep state operatives have coalesced around his reelection bid. I am so disappointed that America will not experience a term or two of Blagojevich. He'd show what the rest of the world already knew. The 1990s weren't a golden age; they were nauseating. Just because American media companies chose to ignore that, it doesn't mean it didn't happen.</b></p>`)

<p>18 hours ago</p><p><b>Kelly Agner</b> BBC News</p><p>At midnight on October 11th, 2010, an explosion was heard from the fabled Nord Stream Pipeline being created to pump Russian gas into Europe. With ongoing investigations, I will look into the possible culprits of the attack.</p><p><b>Suspect #1:</b> The Americans</p><p>American opposition to the Nord Stream pipeline creation was not some hidden secret. From its very signing under Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, President Wesley Clark forewarned the deal to pump Russian gas to Germany's ports via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline as an easy bargaining chip for Russia to wage when needed. After the Russo-Georgian war had gone underway, the American President made it his goal to give NATO its next purpose. Hardened by his experience fighting in the Vietnam War, Wesley Clark became a preacher of the Second Cold War, which had begun. At a NATO summit in Brussels, Clark brought up the famed Nord Stream pipeline that was near completion and labeled it a "geopolitical weapon," not a pipeline. So when the pipeline exploded last month, it was only natural for the country labeling Putin as the "Russian menace" to come under suspicion.</p><p><b>Suspect #2:</b> The Russians</p><p>It's no secret that after Wesley Clark's victory in the 2004 United States presidential election, Putin had prepared to deal with a hostile Western Hemisphere. General Clark was famed for his career saving Kosovo from the vilified Serbians, a close brother nation to Russia. It is well known that Clark nearly brought the conflict to a worldwide affair by ordering troops to engage Russian troops at Pristina Airport, and if not for insubordination in his ranks, none of us would be here right now. From the first moment Clark took his seat in the Oval Office, he made wariness of the threat posed by Russia a headline at every opportunity. So Putin might have chosen to pull the plug on this project, given the strange unity between NATO nations.</p><p><b>Suspect #3: </b>Al-Qaeda</p><p>Still reeling from the death of their ring leader, Osama Bin Laden, the terrorist organization has been a key suspect floated by both the United States and Russia as the culprit. Given the tension between the two countries, many suspect the terrorists behind 9/11 were hoping to reignite it to get the two powers to throw their weight at each other. Al-Qaeda has hopes to shake attention from both the United States in Iraq and Russia's interest in Syria. It's not impossible to imagine that they'd go to these lengths to achieve those ends.</p><p>We will likely not know who was behind this bombing until investigations by both Germany and Russia conclude, but nobody is above suspicion.</p><br><span style="color:blue;"><u>What the Clark Administration "Better no gas than a chokehold" memo implies</span></u> (Jan 11th 2011)<br><span style="color:blue;"><u>Second Cold War or another round of cheating puffing?</span></u> (Jan 22nd 2011)<br><span style="color:blue;"><u>Senator Jeff Sessions leads the pack of wolves in the Senate, hoping to reel in Clark's Cold War 2 rhetoric</span></u> (Jan 21st 2011)</p>`)

<p><b>By Edward Anthony | Washington Dispatch | November 26th 2011</b></p><p>SCATHING - In a moment that blindsided the entire world, President Wesley Clark appeared to reference the notorious video game mission "No Russian" from Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. The American President offered a scathing rebuke at a United Nations international panel, claiming that the mission would "teach Russia a lesson" about the cultural consequences of authoritarianism.</p><p>The remarks were not pre-planned, and the President had deviated from the planned address due to the Russian Federation's advances against Ukraine's most eastern territories. Starting off ranting about the moral bankruptcy of the Russian Federation, and quickly ad-libbed into controversial territory.</p><p>"The Russian Federations glorification and usage of the sympathy card is pathetic," Clark said. "If Putin wants to test the limits of civilization and world order he should expect the cultural division he creates to mount in greater depth than this 'No Russian' video game could ever hope to accomplish."</p><p>The mission in question, in which players participate in a fictional mass shooting at a Russian airport, garnered widespread international condemnation. The mission is not present in copies of the game sold in Germany, Poland, and Russia.</p><p>After the speech, Russian Ambassador Victor Vitaly Churkin condemned the remarks as an "insane provocation" that glorified terrorism through the veil of moral high ground.</p><p>Social media criticism ballooned with hashtags like #NoRussianGate and #WesleyMakarov trending.</p><p><b>The White House Press Secretary would later issue a clarification:</b></p><p>"The President wasn't condoning any acts of violence against Russia or its people. The President stands by nations threatened by Russian aggression and stated that if Russia continued to provide international condemnation, sympathy would be hard to come by.</p><p>The Kremlin has demanded a heartfelt apology, but reports claim that the President has no intention of backing down.</p>`)

<p>By <b>[Lisa Fargo]</b></p><p><b>May 23, 2011</b></p><p><b>TRIPOLI—</b>The international scene has recently erupted due to Libyan Dictator Muammar Gaddafi's claims of donating money to influence various Western elections, spurring a political upheaval in those countries. The most damning claims were made against U.S. President Wesley Clark and French President Nicholas Sarkozy, whom Gaddafi stated to have donated money toward their respective elections in 2008 and 2007. As both leaders attempt to fight the fires brought about by these claims, Gaddafi continues to fight for the soul of his nation, with the ongoing Libyan Revolution threatening his position.</p><p>Are his claims valid? No one can say for sure now, but opposition leaders in France and the United States have come forward demanding an investigation. President Clark, whose turbulent 2008 reelection bid victory had been attributed to his leadership in dealing with the economic crisis, is now under speculation for foreign influence. Clark, who made a point that the situation in Libya needs to be handled delicately, faces allegations that he's too close to Gaddafi. The election interference claims now serve to further muddy the waters he treads, but there is no concrete evidence to say that the Clark campaign used or received any funds from Libya. Congressional Republican leaders have called to open an impeachment inquiry to "collect the facts properly," but Democrats remain at the President's defense.</p><p>Sarkozy, however, faces a much greater challenge as the 2012 French presidential election looms over his mandate like a storm. The claims that he took funds from Libya hold more weight with the opposition since, following his 2007 victory, he pursued a policy of detente with Libya. The recent reversal of Sarkozy's Libya policy has put the President under fire for "trying to save face" and avoid an investigation.</p><p>Since 2007, both the United States and France have sought to deepen ties with both leaders, hoping to undo the frosty relations of the early 2000s, but this scandal serves to uproot such progress. The socialist opposition in France has repeatedly attacked President Clark as a divisive force on the national stage. Their qualms lie in the President's policy in dealing with conflicts like the Russo-Georgian war and the declining relations between Ukraine and Russia. If Sarkozy were to be ousted, President Clark's united NATO dream could be soiled by a socialist fire breather taking the reins in France. </p><p>For now, the world watches as two presidents attempt to cleanse the aroma of controversy without losing the mandate they rule by.</p>`)

<p><b>Janet Ronan || NBC</b></p><p><b>July 18th 2011</b></p><p>The captain who ships American interests across the Atlantic in crusades now finds that comic book nerds and casual moviegoers have replaced his crew of usual suspects. A recent NATO conference held in New York City came under bombardment of unusual spectators and Q&A participants. The conference held just after the premiere of Tom Cruise's Iron Man found itself packed full of viewers who had just left the theater with big questions for the President. </p><p>One participant wearing a T-shirt of Toby Maguire's Spiderman 4 asked the following:</p><p><b>"Mr. President, I think I can speak for everyone when I ask if you are going to work to free the Republic Of Latvaria from Russian occupation?"</b></p><p>The question hit the floor with a thud of silence and confusion from both the President and Prime Minister Gordon Brown. It sparked an argumentative back and forth between the President and the participant over what Clark thought was a confusion with the country of Latvia, which isn't currently under threat from Russia. The questioner pressed forward, however, buoyed by an agreeing crowd demanding the President to "Free Latvaria!"</p><p>So what the hell is Latvaria? Well, it's a long story that begins in April 1962, when Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created a character for Marvel Comics called Doctor Doom. Doctor Doom is a wizard/tech genius who is the arch-nemesis of the Fantastic 4. He's a character who commands the will of an entire country named Latvaria in Eastern Europe. The confusion begins with the success of Fox's Fantastic Four series, which gave rise to a grander cinematic Marvel universe, dubbed the MCU. The Fantastic Four movies were instant box office hits, generating over $2 billion in revenue across three films and billions more from other interconnected films, such as Universal's The Incredible Hulk and Sony's Spider-Man series, which joined the universe with Spider-Man 4, introducing other characters like Doctor Strange. Doctor Doom is the primary antagonist in the Fantastic Four, and the third film of the series is an allegory for Russia's brutal invasion of Georgia, being displayed in Doctor Doom's takeover of Latveria.</p><p>The problems arise when the line between the film's world and the real world is blurred. In what appears to be a widespread Mandela effect, the top results on Google charts in the last few months have been questions asking, "Where is Latvaria?" And "when did Russia invade Latvaria?"</p><p>So, imagine President Clark's face when he, a five-star decorated general with decades of experience overseeing conflicts in Eastern Europe, is challenged on his knowledge of that theater by a parade of comic con "experts." It is safe to say that the conference ended earlier than expected, and while Republicans cackled from the scene, some Democratic analysts feel that this is their chance to drum up support for the President's foreign initiatives.</p><p>Reportedly, when leaving the conference building, the President was heard uttering the words, "No Child Left Behind failed our education system."</p><p>More from NBC:</p><p>What is Scientology and is the new Iron Man a propaganda piece for it?</p><p>Will Christopher Nolan's take on Superman be faithful to the comics?</p>`)

We just had a hearing on the war in Georgia where Secretary Levin answered questions about troop deployments and missile movements. I sigh and remember my failed presidential campaign.</p><p>I could’ve stopped this, I think to myself. Joe tells me I need to stop beating myself up for the loss, that anybody would’ve lost in the face of Russia’s invasion, but I can’t help but feel it’s all my fault. I let America down.</p><p>I sigh as I exit the Capitol building, wincing at the sharp cold. After all these years in DC, I’m still an Arizonan at my core through and through. I get in the backseat of the car waiting to take me to my urban apartment and open my flip phone to make a call.</p><p>“Hey Joe, it’s me, I’m on the way back from the hearing.” </p><p>“Okay, I’m just getting started on making dinner. It’s your favorite, shrimp scampi, plus Dianne gave me this expensive sauvignon blanc from Napa.” I clung on to every syllable Joe said like it would be his last. The cadence of his voice reminded me of a song from years past.</p><p>“I’m looking forward to it. You cook better than any of these fancy Michelin starred restaurant chefs.” He didn’t actually cook that well, once he even managed to burn popcorn, but I love the thought he puts into these secret dinners.</p><p>“Oh, John, you flatter me. Anyways, I’ll see you soon. Be safe.”</p><p>“Ok, you too Joe.” I flip my phone shut, turning my view to the window of the car.</p><p>I notice a group of Marine helicopters flying in formation over the city. It’s not unusual to see helicopters flying around, but it’s a little later than I would normally see them. Must be a night vision training drill, I think to myself. We pass all the great monuments tourists flock to in droves, the Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, the Vietnam War memorial. That last one is a painful one for me. </p><p>We round the corner of my building and I hop out on the curb in front of the entrance.</p><p>“Good evening, Senator.” I smile back and give a polite nod to the doorman. </p><p>The elevator can’t move fast enough as I fill with anticipation to see Joe again. I rummage around in my pocket to retrieve my keys and unlock my front door. The aroma of seafood fills my nostrils as I cross the threshold and I spot Joe in the kitchen wearing an apron.</p><p>“Welcome home, I’m just plating up the food now, will you get the wine glasses?” I happily oblige after taking off my coat, gently setting the glasses on the table. </p><p>I slink my way over to him, going up from behind and wrapping my arms around his waist. I plant two quick kisses on his neck as he lightly giggles. </p><p>“My day was so boring, it’s just a constant drone about ‘We need more money for more bombs’ or ‘We need more troops in Georgia’. Almost fell asleep in a hearing today with Levin at defense, as he went on and on about Russian nuclear capabilities.” I didn’t have to tell Joe any of this, he knew how the Senate worked just as well as I did, but it’s nice to vent and he’s kind enough to listen.</p><p>“Wow, the Maverick thinks his job is boring.” He loved calling me that because he knows it annoys me. “Anyways, food is ready so go sit down.”</p><p>I take my seat at the table as Joe sets the plates of food down and uncorks the wine. He pours us both a glass, with the ending flourish of a trained sommelier. I swirl the glass in my hand and breathe in the slightly tropical aroma before taking a sip.</p><p>We dig into the pasta, eating silently, with only the clinking of our silverware in our ears, as we catch quick glances of each other in between bites. </p><p>“So, John, I’ve been thinking about something and I want to tell you.”</p><p>“Oh boy, you’re always thinking about something or another. Go ahead, lay it on me.”</p><p>“Well, we’ve been together for a while now, since that fateful night during the campaign. And I really, really love you and I love spending time with you. I want to be with you all the time. So, John, will you mar-”</p><p>The whole apartment fills with a holy light. The glass windows shatter, the apartment building begins to buckle and collapse. I’m knocked unconscious but not before I see Joe’s face one more time, the last syllable still hanging out of his mouth. </p><p><b>A/N: </b>PSYCH! The chapter was short because there was a nuke!!!!!

<p><b>By Rachel Kamen | The Atlantic | February 19, 2012</b></p><p>In Washington, nobody talks openly about holding an election anymore, fearing the general's gaze. What was once an opposition has now taken to kissing Wesley Clark's feet if he were to grace them with ceremonial elections. With the historical election deadline looming, many now wonder if the General's temporary emergency powers are ever to sunset. </p><p>The National Reconstruction Regime has yet to waver, and apart from faint voices decrying his dictatorial decree from outside Washington, Clark stands above the fray. The story remains the same; the emergency is not over.</p><p>What began as a normal economic downturn spiraled into a full-scale collapse of the American financial system. Whether Clark, the Democrats, or the Republicans were to blame, the system had failed to save itself. Bank of America, Lehman Brothers, AIG, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac all fell within a two-month period. The following months would see the auto industry collapse. Then, President Wesley Clark stood paralyzed, politically unable to act or follow his instincts.</p><p>The constitution prevented him from bypassing the gates of congressional gridlock. The election threatened to sink his rule. Yet all he could do was stand between utter damnation and Sisyphean callings. </p><p>So in November 2008, Clark took hold of a combination of war powers and vague executive authority to suspend Congressional duties and transfer fiscal authority to a new economic war council. He justified the move, calling it "not a consolidation of power, but an act of survival." Impeachment proceedings were attempted but soon dismissed as the military intervened. </p><p>With Clark's only obstacle being his ability to hold the trust of the American voter, he folded. Effectively, President Wesley Clark put the 2008 election on hold. An emergency brake to save himself from the humiliation of losing a popularity contest.</p><p>Now, four years later, the General finds himself holding higher titles and wearing more prestigious symbols. His opposition remains rhetorically penniless and without the drive to challenge his rule. </p><p>However, one beacon of hope remains. Governor of the Alaskan Commune, Mike Gravel, stands at his perch shouting down the regime. Alaska remains a state in Clark's America, but it is ruled by a man opposed to him. Many ask why he allows Gravel to make a mockery of his mandate, and reports allege that Clark enjoys having "banter with a rival." </p><p>Many still ask if Clark intends to hold the 2012 election as scheduled, even if just for a ceremony. The General remains coy on the matter, however, only flirting and playing with people's emotions. And what of the opposition? Some claim not even the worst Republican looks forward to managing a country this far lost.</p>`)

<p><b>By Sarah Gina – October 12, 2012</b></p><p>Former Vice President Al Gore re-entered the national spotlight at a rally for Democratic nominee Vice President Mary Landrieu, but instead of a showing of party unity, the appearance left more Democrats uneasy.</p><p>Gore, who spent the majority of his post-political career fighting for climate change awareness, issued what pundits are calling "a half-baked endorsement" for the Democratic ticket. Landrieu already faces an uphill battle against Minnesota Governor Tom Emmer, and Gore's less-than-seven-minute speech does little to narrow the gap. Gore praised "her dedication to her country" and "commitment to doing things right" among other vague platitudes before exiting the stage rather quickly.</p><p>The most significant omission, however, was that the Landrieu campaign was hoping for was for Gore to assure voters that she was a trustworthy candidate on climate issues. Now, with both protests against her reluctance to commit to a more ambitious green agenda and Gore's phone-in endorsement, most are drawing a connection between the two. </p><p>Gore doesn't trust Landrieu to tackle global warming, and it's obvious. When Tom Emmer came out at Gore's landmark documentary The Inconvenient Truth, calling it "climate porn," Landrieu stayed silent. Why, you may ask? Because she agrees, Landrieu is a well-documented friend of big oil, fracking, and other green energy proposals. She is the Democrat who speaks for ExxonMobil, not the people worried for their planet's future.</p><p>Gore was among the last to contribute to Landrieu's election effort and the least enthusiastic of the crowd. When he finally got out there for her, he refused any Soaring rhetoric backed by his Tennessee fire and instead read the script as it was written.</p><p>Even the Republicans noticed with Emmer claiming, "if Al Gore can't even get excited for my opponent, why should anyone else?"</p><p>While the Landrieu campaign refuses to indulge in speculation and has embraced Gore's support, the Clark and Clinton eras are seemingly withering away. Only when the votes are tallied will we learn how far gone the Clinton coalition has withered away.</p>`)

<p><b>By Harriet Sinclair - Fox, December 18, 2013</b></p><p>Corruption within the Wesley Clark administration built up an international apparatus to subvert the will of the American people. Downing Street has been exposed for dispatching teams of advisors to aid then-Vice President Mary Landrieu defeat Senator Jim DeMint in the 2012 presidential election.  </p><p>In what has been gathered and labeled "conspiratorial" by the administration, Prime Minister Gordon Brown allegedly flooded the United States political system with crooks willing to spread lies about DeMint.</p><p>Advisors handpicked by Brown crossed the Atlantic to provide expertise and help with campaign messaging and media strategy. The playbook was written based on observing the Prime Minister's success in securing a fifth consecutive term for the Labour Party. Some strategies were impossible to replicate, such as leveraging the morale boost garnered from the London 2012 Olympic Games to call the election immediately afterward. However, the strategy of labeling DeMint an indecisive dunce for mistakenly identifying the famous French military officer Lafayette as a key abolitionist during the American Civil War, among other overblown "scandals," was used against the Republican ticket. </p><p>Our relationship with our British friends is invaluable, and making spurious claims about Gordon Brown's government would set a dangerous precedent in shaping policy. – Fmr. President Wesley K. Clark.</p><p>As if the former president, who likely arranged such an agreement, has any credibility to shut down inquiries into such a relationship. Foreign political consultants are one thing, but if even 5% of the claims made come true, impeachment is warranted. </p><p>If Landrieu's campaign willingly allowed foreign agents to run amok of sacred American elections. The British aren't novices in tampering with our elections. The same political wretches who sabotaged pro-peace candidates in both World Wars have a long history of getting their hands dirty to secure Democratic candidates and the strings that help puppeteer them. </p><p>DeMint dared to question what the American people gained from such a uniquely close alliance between Clark and Brown. Like many of us, we wanted to know how the president of the United States, speaking at Devos, would lower mortgage prices. Instead of confronting these issues honorably, the Democratic Party showed its hand and bent over for foreign aid.</p><p>"Republicans need to realize that we are in a race against the clock. If we continue to allow foreign leaders sink our children's futures with eternal Democratic dominance then we truly are lost." Said DeMint at a Heritage Foundation conference. "That's why as President of the Heritage Foundation I'm making it one of our key priorities to invest in Republicans willing to end all foreign influence in our political system!"</p><p>The next era of American Politics is under threat from the Democratic Party forgoing law and order in exchange for continued political dominance.</p>`)

<p><b>By CNN Political Unit || November 7, 2012</b></p><p>Political analysts and pollsters are shaking after an outcome few could have predicted took place last night. Vice President Mary Landrieu will be the next president of the United States, defeating Governor Chris Christie in an upset. A third consecutive Democratic term is secured at the expense of the Republican Party's confidence.</p><p>If you tuned into FOX election night coverage, the victory capped off an already horrific night of pain and aching. Karl Rove, the once influential architect of what would be the Republican Party's comeback after being ejected from power eight years prior, sat visibly shaking and unresponsive, according to on-set witnesses.</p><p>"We were expecting a fight, some shouting, some pleading or explaining, something that mimicked his meltdown four years prior. Some states had to have it wrong, the calls were coming in too early, not enough votes were counted, any excuse, anything. We got nothing. Rove sat there in his chair staring at the screen emotionless and it was frightening."</p><p><b>Christie "The Unbreakable"</b></p><p>Republicans entered the night confident after the last two upset defeats they had suffered at the hands of Wesley Clark, believing this time they had it in the bag. Democrats were exhausted, and Landrieu represented the tower of fatigue and was unmotivated for the Democratic base.</p> <p>Compared to Christie, who was seemingly an all-star political champion, it was a sure bet in the Republican mindset. However, weakness bubbled to the surface as Christie's spotless record began to crack under the scrutiny of being on the national scene. Campaign finance violations were the first to crack the seal, which Christie slapped away easily to his shady practices as Attorney General, to his shoddy gubernatorial mismanagement of halfway houses, causing the escape of over 1000 prisoners, one of whom went on to kill a woman. Nearly every week, at least one headline was dominated by a micro scandal and claims from former staff members of his that he was brutish and mean in person. </p><p>Despite all this, Republicans remained adamant that the Democrats would lose. The campaign season saw the highest number of negative advertisements in political history from both Democrats and Republicans. Since both Landrieu and Christie came under fire for a variety of scandals, many felt that the political situation was still broadly against the incumbent party.</p><p><b>Rove Where Art Thou?</b></p><p>Within Fox News' election night headquarters, Rove reportedly boasted that the election was won after Christie took the lead in New Hampshire by 3 points and that the worries over North Carolina and Virginia taking exceptionally long to call were "nothing to fret about." But as 11 pm approached, calls from Iowa, Colorado, and Virginia all came in for Landrieu, and the tone in their voices began to change. Then the calls came in, CNN and NBC called Florida for Landrieu, confirming what many had started to accept in the room.</p><p>"He wasn't yelling, he wasn't pleading. He just sat there," said one staffer. "It was like watching a general realize his final offensive was a bust and we were stuck with the consequences."</p><p>The mastermind of the 2000 electioneering to secure Bush's victory in Florida had no words left. Unlike last time, he didn't contest the results furiously, as most had hoped. The results in the key states needed were unchallengeable. FOX couldn't hold off on calling the race any longer as the window of Christie's electoral chances closed in the Sunshine State. </p><p><b>Clark's Final Conquest </b></p><p>Landrieu's victory became a symbolic victory for the Democratic Party, marking the first time since Franklin Roosevelt that Democrats had held the presidency for three consecutive terms. Her campaign was Clark's last mission to continue the progress made in returning accountability and prestige to the American economy.</p> <p>But beyond the political ramifications, Landrieu's victory was history in the making. The glass ceiling that kept women below men was shattered; a woman would lead the United States of America for the first time in its history. When all the stations called the election for her, she took the stage with a stride and a sense of glory.</p><p>Republicans are back in the wilderness with Christie's leadership of the party already being cannibalized; now, the postmortems are as brutal as one can expect. Following an era defined by financial crisis and foreign wars, most expected this year to be the Republicans' year, but instead, we follow Landrieu into the future.</p><p>As for Rove, aides told CNN that he eventually left the studio without giving a proper goodbye, following the results. One Republican strategist claimed, "When Rove goes quiet, you know the Republicans are in trouble."</p>`)

<p><b>By Jaywon Choe</b></p><p><b>September 21, 2010 / 6:40 PM EDT / CBS News</b></p><p>Republican Senator and nominee for President of the United States, J.D. Hayworth, has been found to have starred in a religious infomercial promoting "Miracle Springwater," made by televangelist Peter Popoff through his ministry.</p><p>Senator Hayworth took office in 2011 after successfully launching a primary challenge to then Senator John McCain and going on to win the general election by over 8 points. While battling McCain, he had already been embroiled in a scandal involving a different infomercial for the National Grants Conferences in 2007, in which he encouraged viewers to attend seminars to obtain free government money. While the McCain campaign failed to utilize this issue effectively, Democrats criticized it and other issues that were harming Hayworth's candidacy. Hayworth heavily underperformed in comparison to Senator McCain's polling for the general election, but prevailed comfortably nonetheless.</p><p>However, just four months after taking his seat, Hayworth would star in an infomercial that began to air on media networks, promoting Popoff's Miracle Springwater. "Trust me it works," Hayworth tells the camera and goes on to say, "I've known Pete for a long time and when I tell you there's no one I'd rather put my trust in, I mean it."</p><p>Miracle spring water is claimed to give miraculous healing and prosperity in exchange for donations to the Popoff ministry. Popoff's trail of controversy began in the 1980s, when he'd perform "healing sermons" in which he would accurately guess people's addresses and "cure" them of any given illness. Popoff's methods were exposed as fake TV work in 1986 by magician and skeptic James Randi.</p><p>Hayworth's campaign manager, Mark Sanders, released a statement downplaying the incident and Hayworth's relationship to Popoff. However, the Senate ethics committee, led by California Senator Barbara Boxer, has launched an investigation into Hayworth, alleging possible corruption related to his relationship with Popoff.</p><p>Republicans have come to Hayworth's defense, alleging that the Senate investigation is a witch hunt. "What this is really about is punishing children of God," Texas Governor Rick Perry commented.</p><p>Fellow Tea Party rising stars, such as Alaska Senator Joe Miller, have taken a different approach to confronting the scandal. "What Hayworth did was endorse a fine product, I've benefited greatly from Mr. Popoff's Spring water, and I'd happily help him spread the word of such miracles," said Miller on CNN. Regardless of his colleagues' opinions, the scandal has likely sunk his chances of defeating Vice President Landrieu this November.</p>`)

<p>Poor Rick Perry. No campaign events. No last-minute scandal to plague his opponent. Despite delegating most of his campaign duties to his running mate, Nikki Haley, he has continued to have a weak presence on the national stage, and he has finally chosen to explain why. According to the Perry camp, all of his stumbling and poll numbers languishing are to be attributed to one disadvantage. His back. </p><p>While Republican pundits devise conspiracy theories about why Perry is slipping in the polls, the Texas Governor has heard the pleas of his supporters. In what many call desperate and some call brave, the Governor has addressed concerns about his campaign, giving a speech to a rowdy crowd in Cleveland last night. He pleaded for electoral mercy via sympathy. Sympathy for his inability to remain comfortable.</p><p>Perry told the crowd he has had "severe pain" in his spine since getting surgery last year and that it has made campaigning for president "totally unbearable." However, he ended such an admission by telling his supporters to "remain hopeful" and "vote like your grandmother's life depends on it!"</p> <p>Comparisons to Franklin D. Roosevelt have been thrown around for the reason that Perry's disability should be a non-factor when voters go to the polls. Not because Perry has similar political instincts or because he runs a well-oiled machine that can turn out the votes just by speaking over the radio, or that he has led the country through turmoil and struggle, but because, like FDR, he has an aching back. Perry can't do all that without a chair, a chiropractic adjustment, and a nap.</p><p>Meanwhile, Clark's understudy makes headway throughout the swing states as a trend if Landrieu for President signs begin to overwhelm Perry's operations. Clark came under fire for commenting on Perry's ailments, saying, "there's no doctor's note for when you apply to serve, you either serve or get out of the way."</p><p>Perry insists that he's in this to win it, but as Roosevelt taught us, a bad back doesn't stop a great leader.</p>`)

<p><b>By Jonathan M. Keane | September 2012</b></p><p>New American Patriotism became the rallying cry of the American people when Wesley Clark stepped onto the national stage. He presented the American people with a change not just in policy but in mentality. After four long years during which the Bush Administration played up fears of terror and the idea that you were not patriotic if you disagreed with them, Clark's slogan became a source of comfort. It attacked a core issue that many Americans felt permeated throughout the country.</p><p>Since scoring a victory in both 2004 and 2008, Clark continued to lead the country forward, not back. However, as the President's era of American politics reaches its twilight, his loyal Vice President was presented with the challenge of charting a new path. Unlike President Clark, Mary Landrieu went forward with a more modest slogan, "Keep the Home Front Strong!" Most alarming is the first word in her motto, "Keep," a word that neither inspires change nor even suggests moving in a slightly different direction. It signals to the American people that Landrieu intends to govern more of the same as her boss, at a time when Gallup polls show that over 58% of voters want significant policy change.</p><p>You would assume that, naturally, the opposition has jumped at this opportunity to present bold and fresh ideas. Former New York Governor George Pataki rose to national prominence after stepping over opposition candidates in the Republican primary like a giant. Since winning the Republican nomination, he has chosen an oddly familiar slogan, "Win It For The Gipper!" A reference to former President Ronald Reagan, whom Pataki often praises. It's safe to say that presenting your ideals and ideology with the hope that voters are looking as far back as 1988, since Reagan was in office to "make him proud," is not a winning strategy.</p><p>In what many are beginning to call "the nation's most dull election," the need for truly inspiring slogans is palpable. It is a politician's sole job to be elected, and to earn a vote, you need to work for it. Instead, presidential candidates are now refusing to work for the American people on even the simplest of tasks, such as exciting them. Some claim that the two major party nominees conspired to lower the voters' expectations as a mutually beneficial deal. Perhaps both nominees want to take American politics back to simpler days. Forego the flashy lights and writing fat checks; possibly our presidential candidates would do well to return to front-porch campaigning.</p><p>Trying is no longer a requirement in American politics. You don't need a spicy slogan to win anymore as long as you lower your supporters' expectations. </p>`)

<p><b>By Sarah Gina – October 12, 2012</b></p><p>Former Vice President Al Gore re-entered the national spotlight at a rally for Democratic nominee Vice President Mary Landrieu, but instead of a showing of party unity, the appearance left more Democrats uneasy.</p><p>Gore, who spent the majority of his post-political career fighting for climate change awareness, issued what pundits are calling "a half-baked endorsement" for the Democratic ticket. Landrieu already faces an uphill battle against Minnesota Governor Tom Emmer, and Gore's less-than-seven-minute speech does little to narrow the gap. Gore praised "her dedication to her country" and "commitment to doing things right" among other vague platitudes before exiting the stage rather quickly.</p><p>The most significant omission, however, was that the Landrieu campaign was hoping for was for Gore to assure voters that she was a trustworthy candidate on climate issues. Now, with both protests against her reluctance to commit to a more ambitious green agenda and Gore's phone-in endorsement, most are drawing a connection between the two. </p><p>Gore doesn't trust Landrieu to tackle global warming, and it's obvious. When Tom Emmer came out at Gore's landmark documentary The Inconvenient Truth, calling it "climate porn," Landrieu stayed silent. Why, you may ask? Because she agrees, Landrieu is a well-documented friend of big oil, fracking, and other green energy proposals. She is the Democrat who speaks for ExxonMobil, not the people worried for their planet's future.</p><p>Gore was among the last to contribute to Landrieu's election effort and the least enthusiastic of the crowd. When he finally got out there for her, he refused any Soaring rhetoric backed by his Tennessee fire and instead read the script as it was written.</p><p>Even the Republicans noticed with Emmer claiming, "if Al Gore can't even get excited for my opponent, why should anyone else?"</p><p>While the Landrieu campaign refuses to indulge in speculation and has embraced Gore's support, the Clark and Clinton eras are seemingly withering away. Only when the votes are tallied will we learn how far gone the Clinton coalition has withered away.</p>`)

<p><b>By Mike Wilderbeek – December 3, 2013</b></p><p>If any four words cycled throughout the American left's mind, it would be "I Told You So." The decision of any Democrat to sit out or cast their ballot for a third party has laid a reckoning for the working people of America.</p><p>"Landrieu is too conservative," they said, "she's compromised," they screamed, all while Governor Mitch Daniels pickpocketed the American people right in front of their faces. The lack of urgency prevailed in the minds of millions of American voters, and why? Shortsighted attacks on Landrieu's lack of commitment to more progressive ideals have led us to this point.</p><p>The crescendo of the Republican Party's long con game to rid the workers of their rights lay before us. Last night, the National Right-to-Work Act passed through the House. While the progressive movement allows itself to be handicapped by who they believed was a well-mannered technocrat, the working people suffer at the hands of a governing autocrat.</p><p>In 2012, Daniels campaigned on the fundamentals, with the more contentious elements of his agenda tightly kept behind a curtain of vague platitudes and messaging. He'd say "competence" and "fiscal stability" until your ears ring while never straying too far from the center rhetorically. Not to say that the signs hadn't already existed after this bill was modeled after a failed initiative of his while he was Governor.</p><p>The provider wasn't that the voters didn't know what he might do; they didn't want to listen to the woman who pointed out the obvious. Whether out of a deep-rooted misogynistic tendency or pure ignorance, the American electorate chose to ignore the messenger, most likely because for once the usual "he" was a "she."</p><p>When Gallup asked Democratic voters who stayed home whether they regretted their decision, over 88% said yes. However, when given a follow-up question on whether they'd support Landrieu today 61% still said they would not. They are willing to admit that they had the shoe on the wrong foot, but still choose to let it be. </p><p>The lesson many absentee Democrats have learned is not that they were wrong to stay home and ignore the coming destruction of the workers' ability to fight for greater wages, but that the Democrats chose the wrong person to fight it. Not because she was bad, but because she was a woman.</p>`)

<p><b>By Julie Mormom || ABC || September 8, 2012</b></p><p>California Governor and Republican nominee for President Meg Whitman has no one more to thank than President Wesley Clark if she wins this November. The opportunity to become president of the United States came through the actions of the president.</p><p>In 2005, Clark appointed one of his political allies, former Governor Gray Davis, to serve as Secretary of Education. Davis, still brooding over his painful recall from California's gubernatorial mansion, took the position without skipping a beat, seeing it as his political rehabilitation. The role served as a good engine to fuel his future through managing the early stages of the No Child Left Behind program. Little did the people of California know that the Secretary was eyeing an eventual comeback bid years later.</p><p>When Davis entered the race for Governor in 2010, he was immediately confronted with popular Attorney General Jerry Brown over the sins of his past. However, through careful political maneuvering on the part of the Clark administration, Davis secured the nomination. Although President Clark's approval rating remained a liability for national democrats and Davis being directly tied to his administration, the assumption was that Davis would prevail on the back of Governor Schwarzenegger's unpopularity. Instead, in the greatest upset of the election cycle, California would remain red on the gubernatorial level.</p><p>Whitman's victory propelled her to national prominence, and she easily navigated the Republican Party's presidential primaries. The face of Silicon Valley would become a familiar sight on television nationwide. Vice President Landrieu's polling numbers trailing far behind Whitman's is a result that she can only attribute to her boss. </p><p>Landrieu has done herself no favors by failing to capitalize on the electorate's rage against big business. Instead, she has opted for a divide-and-conquer strategy, without having her own camp secured and united behind her. </p><p>Accidents happen in politics, but Wesley Clark surely spilled soup on his Party's shirt by propelling Davis and indirectly Whitman to the presidency, potentially.</p>`)

Four years ago, our country found itself at the brink of economic damnation at the hands of Wall Street. Coming out strongly against any movement seeking to oust those same folks from their positions of power is strictly un-American!</p><p>The idea for Occupy Wall Street, which started with roughly 200 activists in New York, ballooned into the crosshairs of an unexpected ally, which is major for the movement.</p><p><b>2.

<p><b>By Matt Shuham</b></p><p><b>October 24, 2012, 4:13 p.m.</b></p><p><b>Start your day with TPM.</b></p><p><b>Sign up for the Morning Memo newsletter.</b></p><p>Conservative shock jock Rush Limbaugh warned Cain supporters not to assume polls showing the GOP nominee losing was "rigged," offering insight to Cain supporters frustrated by the Republican candidates' poor polling against Vice President Landrieu.</p><p>"I wish that I could sit here and tell you that I, without question, think the polls are rigged. I have thought so in previous elections," Limbaugh said Monday on his radio show.</p><p>Limbaugh admitted that he made a similar mistake in underestimating the support of Wesley Clark 4 years ago.</p><p>"In 2008, honest to God, folks, I thought Wes was gonna lose by ten or fifteen. There weren't any polls that said that. I thought they were all using an incorrect turnout sample," Limbaugh said. "The way I was looking at it was that because the economy went belly up voters would naturally see our solutions as more viable. Turns out they never did and Clark was able to prove himself."</p><p>What skews expectations this time around is the controversy surrounding Cain while still holding a tight grip over the Republican base. By contrast, Landrieu, who remains in a comfortable position in the polls, faces problems such as a lack of enthusiasm, making people wonder if the turnout is set to drop this year. "If that's the case this year," the Los Angeles Times' David Lauter wrote in August, "then acknowledging Republican turnout advantage against Democrats would probably boost Cain's standing by a point or two."</p><p>Republican Herman Cain sports the Tea Party credentials, hoping to lead the movement to an explosive victory like the rapid congressional gains made by Republicans in the 2010 midterms. Landrieu has stuck by her credentials in bipartisanship and a continuation of the recovering economy credited to the administration's handling of the recession.</p><p>In 2008, as the campaign season hit its final stretch, Limbaugh often told his supporters that polls were biased toward Clark.</p><p>"They are designed to do exactly what I have warned you to be vigilant about, and that is to depress you and suppress your vote," Limbaugh said in late October 2008 when commenting on a CBS/New York Times poll and a Washington Post poll which slightly favored the president. "These two polls today are designed to convince everybody this election is over."</p><p>Today, though, as the 2012 election is well underway, Limbaugh confesses his doubts and offers sage advice for Cain supporters to remain vigilant. "It's a risk here to just throw the polls out and say they don't matter because you end up creating a false reality for yourself that isn't true."</p><p><b>Start your day with TPM.</b></p><p><b>Sign up for the Morning Memo newsletter.</b></p>`)

e.pages.push(`<h3><i>Republicans are Red and Democrats are Blue, or are they?</i></h3>
<p>The 2000 presidential election solidified the color-coded nature of political parties, but as the 2012 election unfolds, that state of normalcy may be turned on its head.</p><p><b>Jodi Enda</b></p><p><b>Updated: November 6, 2012 | Originally Published: October 31, 2012</b></p><p><b>Get our newsletter!</b></p><p>NBC News' 1988 electoral map marked states won by Republican George H.W. Bush in blue and states won by Democrat Michael Dukakis in red. Since then, the color denomination had flipped a few times before eventually being settled by every major network. The Republican candidate was red, the Democratic candidate was blue, or so we thought.</p><p>When Florida flipped from blue to red and vice versa on election night 2000, the crowds of both the Gore and Bush campaigns shouted and cried for their candidates' color. In 2004, when a blue storm swept over the once ruby-red Bush electoral map, the Democratic Party shouted victory in unison, just as they had when Wesley Clark kept the presidency under a rocky and explosive reelection effort. For three consecutive elections, the natural colors of both parties remained the same across merchandise and marketing. However, while I grasp my Crist 2012 hat in royal blue, I find myself wondering differently.</p><p>After claiming the Republican nomination, much to the dismay of his hard-line conservative opponents, Charlie Crist took to remaking the Republican Party, which hadn't won the White House for more than one term since 1984. He chose to hold the Republican National Convention in Miami, Florida, coating the walls and lights in a fluorescent blue that shook the political recognition landscape. </p><p>Blue signs line across Republican-dominated suburbia and creep into the deep-blue urban centers. While the Landrieu campaign played coy with its commitment from the left, the Crist campaign worked to coalesce a symphony that included the dedicated Democratic states of Michigan, New Jersey, Minnesota, and even New York. </p><p><b>Changing the map: What makes Charlie Crist so capable of pulling off such an electoral masterpiece?</b></p><p>Character profiles of the popular Governor from a swing state sweeping an unpopular incumbent are as old as time, but the way he seeks to benefit from such destiny is by expanding his map at the cost of some rural zones in Appalachia. Republican Florida Governor Charlie Crist has always been regarded as "too liberal for his own good" by political allies and a "Democrat in Republican clothing" by primary opponents like Rick Perry. So, when the man who championed notable efforts for the environment and took a relaxed stance on social conservative values goes forward with a similar approach on the national stage, it's no surprise to those who pay attention.</p><p><b>The how and why: Opportunity too good to pass up</b></p><p>The Democratic conundrum, since the election and reelection of a Clark/Landrieu ticket, always arose as the fate of his successor. Landrieu is not a famous liberal stalwart and is barely able to claim the appeal of sensible moderation after 8 years of sticking close to her senatorial career of Democratic conservatism. The agony of being a Blue Dog like her is that no matter how far you run from the past, the progressive movement is always willing to tear you apart for it. Landrieu polls abysmally with the base that she needs to claim victory in a week. From a primary challenge held by progressive stalwarts like Bernie Sanders and loud protests from dovish Senators like Russ Feingold, the incumbent vice president is all but favored to do well with these groups.</p><p>While she fights the fires from the left and confronts the reality that the incumbent president she serves is no popular icon, the Crist campaign is playing the game of divide and conquer.</p><p>Circumstances aside, the worst realization for Democrats is that on several issues, the Vice President finds herself to the right of Crist. It's a fatal elixir that allows a Republican to outflank a Democratic candidate on issues like the environment. However, the few benefits Landrieu can obtain should not be overlooked. Despite political trends favoring Republicans in states like Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia, Landrieu is polling to win in all three, given Crist's weakness on local issues that matter to these states. </p><p>So subtly, Charlie Crist has strategized a coalition-building effort able to encompass the cities. Strong performance in states like New Jersey and Illinois is a worthwhile investment. Nothing is more symbolic than the shift from red to blue, a party switch that could rebalance the state of electoral trends and create something lasting longer than a single term for the Republican Party.</p><p>You might not like the change, but the effectiveness of a simple color change could alter the minds of millions of Americans. Crist must pray that his electoral gambit doesn't backfire in the states he's expected to keep, or else he'll be another footnote in the history of Republican gambles going bust.</p><p><b>You Might Also Like</b></p><p><b>When Republicans Were Blue and Democrats Were Red </b>November 1, 2012</p><p><b>An Interview with meet the press that torpedoed Mike Huckabee's campaign</b>August 17, 2012</p><p><b>Why Herman Cain's endorsement of Constitution Party won't matter </b>October 11, 2012</p><p><b>This Defeated Presidential Candidate best known for his flirtatious relationship with the Vice President has something to say about the presidential race </b>September 19, 2012</p><p><b>Being Nice Isn't a Winning Strategy say President Clark </b>July 19, 2012</p><p><b>Jodi Enda | Read More</b></p>`)

<p><b>By Erick Erickson | 4:46 AM on September 29, 2012</b></p><p>The opinions expressed by contributors are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of RedState.com.</p><p>Over the past twenty-four hours, I have received a lot of heat from friends regarding my take on Scammy Barbour's presidential candidacy. Establishment Republicans want to play pretend and act like they're our voice, but when shit hits the fan, they treat us like imaginary friends that you can easily ignore. The Grand Old Party, as it should be called since it represents so little of red-blooded Republican values, has shown its true colors. The Republican Party's torchbearer, Haley Barbour, was caught red-handed with his fat hands in the cookie jar, trying to steal from what's rightfully the Tea Party's. In a leaked tape from his campaign headquarters, he uttered the words "we can and should divert funds from the Missouri Senate Race" and that Tea Party Patriot Todd Akin had "poisoned his chances." The greedy Republican establishment has gotten cold feet just because Akin said some things. They refer to us as a runaway train that needs to pull its brakes, as if we aren't fighting the fires made by Democrats that they are too cowardly to put a hose to! The GOP loves to make clowns of us, but no longer. I refuse to endorse a Republican so quick to betray a fellow Republican just because he's willing to say what he's too afraid to make clear. President Wesley Clark and his Democratic Party are a cancer on this nation, but I'd rather risk betting that his successor will make for great cannon fodder for when a Tea Party man takes back the White House in 2016. Risking giving power to another visionless establishment GOPer so that they can screw us for another 10 years is precisely what gave us Wesley Clark. I will not stand by and watch beautiful Tea Party gains be smothered in 2014 by a Republican President who failed to act. Friends, I beseech you to keep faith and remind yourselves that 2016 will be our year. Act free as you will, but if you want a real Republican to eradicate and destroy the Democrats, you will not find him in Haley Barbour. </p>`)

<p><b>By Rochelle Williams </b></p><p><b>Madison, Wisconsin — </b>Among a primary filled with partisan grievances, political theater, and rhetoric stood the popular former Utah Governor, Jon Huntsman. The Democratic Party's nightmare was not an evangelical loon ready to ring the bells of social issues or even a Tea Party Huckster declaring war on government spending. The nuclear option was always Governor Huntsman, the moderate heartthrob. </p><p>The well-spoken Governor with a record without blemish, he exited the Republican convention with a decisive lead in most polls. Huntsman had honed in on the sluggish economy, vowing to bring economic opportunity back while slashing taxes for the lower and middle class. Democrats hoped the Governor's positions on social issues and immigration would generate criticism from his right flank, but their hopes fizzled as the GOP, driven by anti-Democrat hunger, rallied behind him anyway.</p><p>But the gloves came off when the conversation trailed off to China.</p><p>One of President Clark's late-term initiatives has been reinforcing American economic interests from the supposed "threat" China poses to American interests both at home and abroad. Democrats have begun to push emphasis on Huntsman's ties to the Huntsman Corporation, with some even labeling Huntsman "the candidate who will sell your jobs to China." Huntsman has pushed back on these claims, proclaiming he has no current ties to the corporation and would work to create new jobs for America's industrial heartland. </p><p>Vice President Landrieu has also taken this rhetoric in her attacks on Huntsman, hoping to claw her way up from the political quicksand that is the economy. However, some of Clark's initiatives to combat China have garnered criticism, like the advocacy for a Trans Pacific Partnership, a proposed trade agreement between 12 Pacific Rim economies: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam, and the United States. The proposal has hit the natural Democratic base of unions, unwilling to accept another free trade agreement without basic assurances that their jobs won't be affected. </p><p>The deal that President Clark has begun negotiations for presents a challenge to his Vice President's campaign, which has so far failed to reconnect with disillusioned workers and distance itself from unpopular trade policies. </p><p>The time for Landrieu to change course is fading rapidly, and her chances of carrying the Democratic torch another four years may just go up in smoke.</p>`)

The "gaffe" was followed by multiple public opinion polls showing Bachmann's support had severely dropped as the post-convention excitement had seemingly vanished for the Congresswoman.</p><p>Vice President Landrieu's early ad campaign also helped beat down Bachmann's polling, revealing much of his radical and sometimes cruel policies related to bullying and her stance on cutting social security. This gaffe has accumulated the distrust of families across the nation, unsettled by Bachmann's blatant disregard for public health safety.</p><p>Likewise, independent voters have begun to break for the Landrieu campaign in even greater numbers, with polls showing the Vice president leading Bachmann by 15-20 points with independent voters. A disappointing sight for Republicans to witness as the Republican National Convention displayed possibly the highest amount of excitement ever before seen for a single candidate.</p><p>Assuming Bachmann can't gain ground with independents, it's unlikely she'll be able to offset those losses by breaking into much of the industrial Midwest since Vice President Landrieu's running mate, <b>Sherrod Brown</b>, has seemingly locked down blue-collar voters.</p>`)

<p><b>By Rachel Donovan || Washington Bureau || February 19, 2018</b></p><p>President Wesley Clark entered the Oval Office with a bold vision for America's space program. When many mocked his investments in lightspeed technology, he remained unfazed. He laid the groundwork for a space legacy that would span both his and President Landrieu's administrations. </p><p>Federal investigators found that the Department of Energy and Lunar Expansion Authority were defrauded of nearly $11.9 billion tied to Akon City Lunar, which promised the White House the first sustainable settlement on the moon.</p><p>What was initially pitched as the administration's "Kennedy Moment" has now become a bureaucratic nightmare with little to no development after years of work. Musical artist and entrepreneur Akon remained committed to the project, which was progressing at a steady pace. However, the merger of bureaucracy and private investment has delivered nothing more than one incomplete housing unit on the moon.</p><p>The project had already garnered the scorn of environmental activists, who claimed that Akon was seeking to obliterate the moon's natural beauty. However, it seems their prayers for the project to be shut down were answered with the planned "self regulated solar domes," and lightspeed energy production has failed to materialize.</p><p>A government watchdog group released a report stating that nearly all of the public funds invested in Akon's visionary project were diverted to offshore accounts in Dubai, with little to no of it actually going towards Lunar infrastructure equipment.</p><p>Akon, also known as Aliaune Thiam, last spoke about the project's health 13 months ago, and reports allege that he fled the country.</p><p>The scandal blew a hole through the Landrieu administration's space technology innovation projects, with Republicans seizing on the moment, labeling the scandal "Moongate."</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Jeff Sessions (R-AL) offered a harsh denunciation of the Landrieu Administration, alleging that "Landrieu and Co stole from the American people," and that "it's our responsibility to hold the culprits accountable."</p><p>Critics claimed the scandal was one of many, with several futuristic prestige-chasing projects, such as Clark's lightspeed technology and subsidies paying for Elon Musk's SpaceX program, failing to provide acceptable results.</p><p>With congressional hearings looming over the administration and Vice President Lamont's presidential campaign gaining momentum, it appears that the 2020 election will be far more than a return to "business as usual."</p><p>As for Akon, he promised Landrieu the moon and returned with nothing but stardust.</p>`)
