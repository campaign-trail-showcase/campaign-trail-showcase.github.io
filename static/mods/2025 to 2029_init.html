Much of Harris' inner circle seems to not think too highly of him, and now his influence in Minnesota politics has utterly dissipated. Despite this, Walz has deep respect for President Harris and is willing to do whatever it takes to ensure her vision for the country is made into reality.

Biden promised a return to normalcy - and failed on this task. Failures in Afghanistan and economic woes sent his approvals into a death spiral he never recovered from. Meanwhile, Donald Trump left Washington as a pariah in 2021, and in the process became not only more authoritarian than ever before, but more popular than before. America was in crisis.<br><br>When Kamala Harris was nominated, few knew what her vision for the country was. When Kamala Harris managed to defeat Donald Trump, even fewer knew what the next four years had in store. Even Kamala Harris didn't know. But she did know that she believed in a better America. At the very least, she believed in an America that was better than the one that nearly elected a convicted felon into office. If this America did not exist, she would make it exist, and would have the next four years to do so.<br><br>This is not the path America chose to go down, however.

Commander in Chief. Leader of the Free World. Most Powerful Person in the World.

A hawkish dove. A radical liberal. A popular loner. He has no great legislative legacy, has founded no great institutions, and yet embodies in himself the possibility of redemptive change.<br><br>The performer playing this role should be able to capture Kennedy’s intensity, his adolescent, self-aggrandizing conviction that he alone must end an inherited war, heal a fractured party, undo his predecessor’s welfare system, and shepherd a nation still trying to decide if it should grow past the traumas of the previous decade or regress to an earlier age. While disguised by a constant, simmering rage, Bobby’s most essential characteristic is a deep loneliness, spurred by a fear that allowing others in will only bring him more hurt.<br><br></div>";
