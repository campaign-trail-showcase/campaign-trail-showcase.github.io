As a paternal descendant of one of America's richest oligarchs and a maternal one of America's most conservative senators. You wouldn't be alone if you would think that the young Rocky would follow suit with his ancestors.<br><br>Nelson A. Rockefeller is currently the popular, hands on Governor of New York State, and has assumed the position since 1959. He has championed a series of liberal policies such as increasing the state's role in education, environmental protection, transportation, housing, welfare, medical aid, civil rights, and the arts. So much so that he became leader of a faction of republicans known as \"Rockefeller Republicans\" and he intends to bring them to greatness this election.<br><br>Rocky goes into this election with alot of great aspects backing him on. His easy going persona and moderate values make him an incredibly palatable choice for many Americans. His tenure as New York's governor has also been widely applauded for its emphasis on helping the lower classes, something peculiar coming from the descendants of billionares. Due to his personal and family riches, money will not be an issue this campaign, and Rocky holds a large amount of sway in the Republican Party, something which he can use to his advantage in gaining a leg up in certain states.<br><br>Unfortunately for Rockefeller, not everything is peaches and cream for his election campaign. His less than amicable divorce to Mary Todhunter Clark in 1962 still hangs over Rocky like a storm cloud, and it nearly cost him the nomination if not for a last-second passionate speech from Connecticut's Prescott Bush saving his prospects in the California Primary. The 1964 RNC this year was especially ugly, with Rocky's main opponent, Arizona's conservative senator Barry Goldwater still feeling bitter about the primaries.

Fannin would also cement your status in the mountain states, which are awfully close this year unfortunately.<BR><BR>Even though Fannin would technically unite the party, he would no doubt be an incredibly controversial running mate. He would turn off most of your base, who would risk staying home if you choose him, another reason is that while you and Fannin dont really have a relationship, you do have one with Fannin's predecessor, Goldwater. Fannin's voting record also does not bode well with yours, with Fannin defending right-to-work laws in Arizona and in other states.<BR><BR>So, if you want to shake up the race and unite the party in the face of near annihilation, then choose Fannin.","candidate_score":1,"running_mate":true,"scrollable":false,"partner":"0"}}];e.running_mate_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.running_mate","pk":2001,"fields":{"candidate":23,"running_mate":1002}},{"model":"campaign_trail.running_mate","pk":2002,"fields":{"candidate":23,"running_mate":1003}},{"model":"campaign_trail.running_mate","pk":2003,"fields":{"candidate":23,"running_mate":1004}},{"model":"campaign_trail.running_mate","pk":2004,"fields":{"candidate":23,"running_mate":1005}},{"model":"campaign_trail.running_mate","pk":2005,"fields":{"candidate":23,"running_mate":1006}}];
