McDichael rose to infamy when he accused president Richard Nixon of sabotaging the Vietnam War peace talks during the 1968 presidential campaign in a <em>Rolling Stone</em> interview. The official police report claimed that McDichael died from a cannabis overdose. However, the official report was disputed by multiple people on the left. His own parents in particular stated that McDichael never left the Mid-Atlantic region in his entire life, and point out that Sleve has been missing for at least 6 weeks. On October 28th, 1972, the autopsy report was leaked to the press. The report showed that McDichael suffered multiple bullet wounds to the back of his head, 52 stab wounds to his abdomen, 27 spinal cord fractures and a broomstick handle situated deep inside his rectal cavity. Historians credit the McDichael Autopsy Report as the most important factor in George McGovern's victory in the state of Massachussetts."
