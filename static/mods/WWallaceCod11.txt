Millions across the nation feel hopeless and despair at this seemingly ascendent and unstoppable force that has gripped the nation. </p>\n\n<b style=\"font-size:16px;\"> There is, however, one man who cares. </b>\n\n<p style=\"line-height:12px;font-size:14px;margin:5px\"> George Corely Wallace, the former Governor of Alabama, has launched a campaign dedicated to fighting back against these forces. He knows it is a losing battle - the dice are weighed against him in every way, institutionally and materially - but that does not matter. What matters to him, and his supporters, is the fight, and the message that this campaign brings: His America will not go quietly into the night that the radicals wish to bring it into.",

This is where I got most of my information about how Nixon played around with and countered Wallace's campaign. </p> <h4> Author Notes </h4> <p> I will address this particular matter, since I do believe that it is a aspect of the mod that should be called out. </p><p>Yes, this mod sucks. This is because it was made last minute as a school project (note: the class this project was made for ended roughly two months prior to it being added to the mod loader. Don't worry I still passed the class lol) I will say, however, that the main focus for me while making this mod was the writing. I wanted to encapsulate how the Wallace campaign ran, and I think I did that well. </p><p> I hope you had fun playing the mod. If you didn't have fun, I hope you at least learned something. If neither of those things occurred, I apologize for wasting several minutes of your life. If both of those things happened, I am glad you enjoyed it. </p> ",
