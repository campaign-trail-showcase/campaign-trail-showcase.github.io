Abrams has refused to concede the election, alleging voter suppression and election tampering on Kemp’s part. Kemp, who resigned as Secretary of State earlier today, has denied Abrams’ claims and accused her of “inciting violence”.</p><p>It’s been a tense and turbulent period for the country ever since the foiled assasination attempt on President Mitt Romney by Bernie Sanders supporter James T. Hodgkinson and the divisive 2016 election campaign. Millions across the nation have participated in protests in recent years condemning the political violence and the crackdown in Republican-ran states. The National Guard has regularly been deployed against peaceful protesters in states like Texas, Florida and Georgia, and as you can see behind me, that is the case tonight.</p><p>Outgoing Governor Nathan Deal in a press conference said he was mobilizing the National Guard to “maintain law and order”. He pointed to last year’s nationwide riots following the assassination of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and stressed he did not want a repeat in the city of Atlanta. He also mentioned calling President Romney for federal assistance following credible assassination threats against both Kemp and Abrams.</p><p>Today’s protests have been mostly peaceful, certainly compared to yesterday, yet tensions remain high. You can see burnt out cars along the street and damaged windows from yesterday’s riots and the protesters are contained here tonight by law enforcement. About 300 people have been arrested so far—</p><p>BYSTANDER: GUN!</p><p>POP!</p><p>POP POP POP!</p><p>BURNETT: AAAAAGGHHH! MY LEG!</p><p>PRODUCER: Shit. Cut the camera. CUT THE CAMERA!</p>`)

Advertisements for the book pushed the idea of a strung out Romney who felt trapped and powerless within the Oval Office.</p><p>Instead, what we get are the same stories that have already been discussed endlessly over the last four years. The shortest State of the Union address in 50 years.  Executive power being used only once, to pardon a low level staffer. The biggest accomplishments being a series of tax cuts and industry deregulations. The most novel story we got was the reason why Romney didn’t attend the inauguration of President Buttigeg: he had already left Washington DC by the start of the New Year.</p><p>This is not to say that there aren’t insightful moments within <em>Silence</em>.  From interviews with a number of people in the Romney inner circle at the time, we learn of his contemplation of resignation in 2019, shortly after attacks by conservative leaders over his nomination of Steven Colloton to the Supreme Court. We also gain glimpses of a White House which seemed increasingly like a corporation: with aides who rotated out every few months, Cabinet meetings that became quarterly check-ins, and a president who could rarely be reached for anything less than a national emergency. However, these moments are sadly too few and far between.</p><p>Ultimately, <em>Silence</em>, like the presidency that it chronicles, leaves us wanting more to fill the quiet and wondering what might have been.</p><p>Note: When reached out about the upcoming release of <em>Silence</em>, former President Mitt Romney did not respond to our inquiry. Instead, his office issued the following statement: “President Romney is extremely proud of his second term which saw continuous drops in unemployment, record growth in industry and successful trade deals with our partners overseas. He is currently preoccupied with the construction of his library in Salt Lake City and his work on the Stewart Peay Senate campaign.”</p>`)

However, last night’s Melissa McCarthy hosted episode has been receiving major flak for a sketch featuring Rachel Dratch as President Klobuchar.</p><p>The sketch opens with President Klobuchar fretting over polling numbers against Republican candidate Mark Cuban. She looks into the camera with what we all know to be her trademark “Midwestern smile” when a naive new aide walks in asking about where a folder might be. With comical precision, she throws a stapler at his head, instantly knocking the poor 24 year old out. The rest of the sketch follows the group of new aides being targeted one at a time by the President, as she runs through policy memos dealing with Russian military buildup and attempts to pass her healthcare plan.</p><p>Already on the Hill there have been furious rebukes of the sketch by members of the President’s Cabinet and staff. On TikTok though, parody videos with the hashtag #KrazyKlobuchar have already started spawning en masse, featuring jokes about the President learning kung fu or authorizing “homing combs” to be installed on every White House desk.</p><p>The sketch also features a cameo by Jason Sudeikis as ex-president Mitt Romney, who awkwardly walks in during a moment where Klobuchar berates a staff member over their failure to wash her dishes correctly. In a deadpan voice, Romney asks whether he could grab some stuff he forgot while he was moving out. A spokeman for the now BYU professor Romney told us that he had “not seen the episode, but found efforts to degrade the President to be distasteful on principle.”</p><p>Klobuchar herself, when asked at a press conference, responded, “I thought it was cute,” and then immediately pivoted to details of her rural broadband expansion plan.</p> <p>It’s been reported a few days after that she gifted White House aides ending their terms with shirts labelled with the caption “I survived Amy Klobuchar and all I got was this lousy T-Shirt.” Sources tell us that this idea came directly from the President.</p>`)

Many Americans at the time had assumed the first woman president would have been a Democrat, such as Hillary Clinton, yet Ms. Ayotte prevailed despite the scandals of her predecessor, former President Mitt Romney.

Let’s go through the most embarrassing moments so far, in case you forgot.</p><h6><span style="margin-left: 15px;">5 - Giving Boy Scouts “The Talk”</span></h6><p>It’s usually a nightmare watching Trump give a speech, especially with that grating voice and consistently horrible grammar. But this speech takes the cake for Most Embarrassing Speech of 2017.</p><p>In July of last year, he gave a speech to the annual Boy Scout Jamboree in West Virginia. It’s a tradition many past presidents have done, and none of them ranted about yacht sex parties in the 70s. Until Trump that is.</p><p>After initially sticking to innuendos, he polled the audience—the audience of 12 to 18 year old boys—and asked them if they wanted to hear more. They said yes, so he did, and the President of the United States rambled on about “yuge tits”.</p><h6><span style="margin-left: 15px;">4 - The Inaugural Crowd</span></h6><p>The very first embarrassing moment, besides Trump winning the election. In Trump’s world, he is the singular most important person and he must do everything better than anyone else. So when it was pointed out to him that Barack Obama, and even Mitt Romney, had a larger turnout for their inaugurations, he resorted to doctored photos and “alternative facts”.</p><p>Trump still brings it up, though that might be because of Romney’s recent appearance on SNL, where he dropped this one-liner after getting rousing applause for his opening monologue, “Sounds like I’m still drawing bigger crowds than Trump.”</p><h6><span style="margin-left: 15px;">3 - Paper Towel-Gate</span></h6><p>The guy is simply incapable of showing empathy. When he went to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, rather than handing out supplies like a normal person, he put on a Tom Brady impression and threw them at the crowd. At one point, he hit a woman square in the face with a roll of paper towels. Guess what his response was?</p><p>“Damn, that was a good shot. You think I can knock someone’s teeth out with this?”</p><p>Yeah. Enough said.</p><h6><span style="margin-left: 15px;">2 - “I’ve Got the Biggest, Most Powerful Nuclear Button”</span><h6><p>This one’s a doozy. Just two and a half weeks ago, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un stated in an address that the nuclear button is on his desk at all times. So of course our commander-in-chief had to weigh in:</p><blockquote><b>Donald J. Trump</b> <span style="color: #BEE5FF;"><u>@realDonaldTrump</u></span>: “North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the ‘Nuclear Button' is on his desk at all times.’ Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!”</blockquote><p>To make matters worse, he doubled down at a recent news conference, calling “his” button, “… the best. It’s truly—I showed it to Melania. I’m like, ‘This is a really big button, isn’t it?’ and she agreed. ‘Oh yes Donald, it’s such a beautiful button.’ Her words.”</p><p>Please tell me he didn’t… confuse it for something else.</p><h6><span style="margin-left: 15px;">1 - Everything About Him</span></h6><p>Let’s be real: everything about our “president” is embarrassing. The way he talks, the hair on his head, his stupid tan, everything about this guy is embarrassing. Even the way he won the election, he claims it was the “Biggest, Most Beautiful Mandate”. No. The only reason he won is because Republican voters are sheep and will vote for whomever they are told to vote for.</p><p>America is going down the drain. And it’s only been one year of the Trump presidency. God help us all.</p>`)

He has announces that he will nominate Judge Sri Srinivasan of the D.C. Court of Appeals to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. Srinivasan is the first Indian American, Asian American and Hindu candidate for the Supreme Court.</p><p>The president lauded Judge Srinivasan’s credentials during a press briefing, “I picked him because he is the most capable candidate out there. He’s intelligent, well-educated, kind, reasonable and committed to overturning <em>Citizens United</em> as well as preserving <em>Roe v. Wade</em> as the law of the land.”</p><p>Srinivasan is the second candidate to fill Justice Scalia’s seat, after the ill-fated nomination of D.C. Court of Appeals Chief Judge Merrick Garland by former President Mitt Romney. Garland’s nomination stalled in the Senate thanks to lockstep opposition from the Democrats, in addition to outrage from conservative Republicans.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) expressed confidence in confirming Srinivasan, “Judge Srinivasan is a great choice for the Supreme Court and I have no doubt we’ll be able to confirm him.” When asked about the possibility of needing to abolish the filibuster, also know as invoking the “nuclear option”, in case of united opposition from Republicans, Schumer demurred, “I don’t think so. Republicans know we can’t leave this seat open indefinitely. The people want President Sanders’ choice on the Court.”</p><p>The nuclear option may end up being needed as Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has vowed to block Srinivasan’s nomination, “Frankly, the Democrats screwed us with their little stunt last year and now they expect us to help them confirm the most radical nominee for the Supreme Court I’ve ever seen. That’s not going to happen. Mark my words, not a single Republican is going to vote for confirmation.”</p><p>All signs point to another long and drawn-out nomination battle.</p>`)

Failure is too kind of a word, catastrophic too generous of an adjective. An administration that was born dead from the moment it started because it was born out of pure spite. From the very beginning, Hillary Clinton was elected to office under the premise that not only would the country return to normal, but the Democratic Party would get rid of those pesky Leftists that made the party "unelectable." Obama and Sanders' failed experiences will be swept aside, and a new pragmatic outlook will be implemented where Centrist common sense triumphs over radical Leftism. Ambitious Liberal policy? Reasonable foreign policy? Fighting for things you believe in? Pipe dreams.

She passed a weak, bare-bones COVID stimulus package for the sake of "bipartisan compromise." She capitulated to the reactionary right on every single issue, with "protecting the border" and "respect for female spaces" becoming all the rage on Democratic think-tanks. She became the Blob's strongest soldier and kept the ball rolling in Afghanistan and the Middle East. She passed unpopular trade agreements that made her extremely popular VP (more about how Sherrod Brown would have saved the day <span style="color: #BEE5FF;"><u>here</u></span>), to abandon the ticket. She ruled the party with an iron fist to make sure that another Bernie Sanders never appears, blocking Progressives from any single race she could get her paws on.</p><p>The Midterms being an absolute massacre should have been a turning point for President Clinton to realize that treating the Left like shit wasn't a viable path forward: they were still going to keep running spoiler candidates if Democrats didn't play ball.</p><p>She didn't.</p><p>Facing a nightmarish scenario against wannabe populist Senator Josh Hawley and his running mate, professional piece of shit Governor Lee Zeldin, where the President was consistently trailing by double-digits and with the party in grave danger of falling apart everywhere, what could possibly go wrong? Nothing really. In fact, we can enumerate all the fantastic things her campaign did in just ten months to win the election:</p><ul><li>Losing Michigan, Vermont, and four other states against activist (bestie <3), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the worst performance for a Democratic incumbent in Primaries since Jimmy Carter.</li><li>Getting two people killed at the DNC because they dared to protest her fantastic foreign policy. She didn't even bother to go to their funerals, by the way.</li><li>Choosing the charisma void entity known as John Hickenlooper as a new running mate.</li><li>Making Bernie Sanders and David Zuckerman stop caucusing with Democrats all together, join the People's Party, and endorse the Turner-Tlaib ticket.</li><li>Calling Joe Rogan a "sexist dipshit" at a rally, causing him to take selfies with Hawley at a Philadelphia brewery.</li><li>Defending the TPP until her face turned purple despite consistently trailing in the Midwest.</li><li>Trying to get Taylor Swift’s endorsement and failing.</li><li>Making rallies with former President Dick Cheney and former Senator Lisa Murkowski, on a very smart play for those sweet Moderate Republican voters. They only needed Larry Hogan's endorsement, and it would be a done deal (he endorsed Hawley one week before the election)!</li><li>Accusing Nina Turner of being a "Khamenei supporter" in the middle of a debate because she said that American bombings of Iran's nuclear facilities didn't accomplish anything.</li></ul><p>The result of this masterpiece of a campaign?</p><ul><li>Becoming the first Democratic candidate in 40 years to lose New York and Maine.</li><li>Becoming the first Democratic candidate in 52 years to lose Minnesota.</li><li>Giving Republicans their first Supermajority in history.</li><li>Making Turkish asset Eric Adams a Senator.</li><li>Making National Socialist Party member Mark Robinson a Governor.</li><li>Losing the popular vote by <strong>11 points</strong>.</li><li>Losing more than <strong>100 House seats</strong> in the last two years, several of them to the Left you wanted to destroy.</li><li>Losing Vermont to a third-party ticket.</li><li>Getting California to single digits.</li></ul><p>The moral of the story?

Without mentioning the president by name, he urged the Sanders Administration to take a cautious approach to its planned withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p><p>“I understand the desire to pull America out of a long-term war,” Romney said. “It’s something this administration is passionate about. I wouldn’t do it—I’d listen to the generals on the ground—but if you’re going to do it, please, be smart about it. Take it slow and prioritize the brave Afghans who helped us during the war.

He is aware of potential complications and will ensure a smooth and orderly withdrawal.”</p><p>Romney has consistently held hawkish views on the war in Afghanistan, increasing troop levels in 2014.

Our military are trained to never accept defeat, to always believe in a path to victory.
