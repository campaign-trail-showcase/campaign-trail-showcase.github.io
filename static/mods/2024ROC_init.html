He has held various positions, including National Assembly representative, legislator, mayor of Tainan City, Premier of the Executive Yuan, and Vice President, making him one of the most seasoned politicians in the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). In 2019, Lai Ching-te competed with President Tsai Ing-wen for the DPP's presidential candidacy. As the leader of the \"New Tide\" faction, his struggle with Tsai Ing-wen weakened the internal unity of the DPP and revealed rifts between the two. Nevertheless, Tsai Ing-wen chose him as her running mate to reunite the party. The Tsai-Lai ticket received a record-breaking 8.17 million votes in the 2020 elections, surpassing the 7.65 million votes obtained by President Ma Ying-jeou in 2008.</p>\n\n<p>However, in the 2022 local elections, the DPP suffered an unprecedented defeat, with its governing counties and cities retreating to a few deep-green areas in the south. In Tainan and Pingtung, the DPP's vote share was only slightly higher than that of the Kuomintang (KMT). Tainan, known as the \"Sanctuary of Democracy,\" has been a stronghold of the DPP, comparable to Massachusetts for the Democratic Party or Alabama for the Republican Party. This has been attributed to the incompetence and drawbacks of the DPP's governance, resulting in President Tsai Ing-wen resigning as party chairperson. Lai Ching-te subsequently obtained the position in the by-election.\n</p>\n<p>As 2023 approaches, Lai Ching-te maintains a relatively favorable position in opinion polls among several potential candidates. However, he is forever branded as a supporter of Taiwanese independence. In his youth, he notably raised a protest sign reading \"Long Live Taiwanese Independence\" in the parliament and identified himself as a \"pragmatic advocate for Taiwanese independence.\" Could this harm Lai Ching-te's prospects? Additionally, with the DPP's nearing eight years in power, public disillusionment with the party has reached a significant level. Will Lai Ching-te manage to maintain his leading position until January 13th, or will he be swept away by the wave of political change? Only time can provide us with the answer.</p>\n",

She once held dual American and Taiwanese citizenship but later renounced her American citizenship to engage in Taiwan's domestic political affairs.

She also has a solid base in the Hualien region, which could help you break through the stronghold of the Kuomintang. However, her drawback is the lack of surprise; she is a safe choice. Media speculation about her potential as your vice presidential candidate has been ongoing for a long time, so if you select her, there won't be much surprise.</P>",

Hou You-yi is the first presidential candidate in the Republic of China with a police background. He has served as the President of the Central Police University, Director-General of the National Police Agency, and is currently the Mayor of New Taipei City. Hailing from the southern region, Hou You-yi is an atypical figure within the KMT, with his down-to-earth image and fluent Taiwanese dialect setting him apart from many other KMT politicians. In last year's elections, Hou You-yi won with an impressive 62.42% of the votes, defeating the DPP candidate and becoming the top-performing candidate nationwide. As the mayor of the most populous city in Taiwan, this was a remarkable achievement, and as a result, Hou You-yi is seen as a popular contender for the KMT's presidential nomination in 2024.</p>\n\n<p>However, the KMT's heavy defeats in the 2016 and 2020 elections have created a bitter political situation. In 2016, the KMT set a record low vote total of 3.81 million due to the \"abolish Hong Xiu-zhu's nomination\" movement, only slightly better than Lien Chan's performance in 2000. In 2019, Han Kuo-yu ran for president a few months after taking office as mayor of Kaohsiung, prompting widespread suspicion that his mayoral campaign was merely a stepping stone to a presidential bid. This resulted in his recall in June 2020. Similarly, as the mayor of a special municipality, Hou You-yi successfully won re-election in 2022, but if selected as a candidate, he will face the same scrutiny as Han Kuo-yu from the public. To make matters more complicated, prominent businessman Terry Gou is also vying for the KMT's presidential nomination, and there have even been rumors of Han Kuo-yu making another bid for the presidency. Mayor Hou's path to candidacy does not appear to be smooth sailing.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at the positive aspects, Hou You-yi advocates maintaining the death penalty and taking a tough stance on crime, aligning with the mainstream public opinion in Taiwanese society. Additionally, coming from the southern region and a native Taiwanese from a local family, he has more appeal to voters in the central and southern regions compared to the traditionally Mainlander-dominated KMT. The DPP's perceived failures in governance are also likely to gather significant opposition sentiment, which could potentially support the KMT. Furthermore, Hou's approval ratings in opinion polls are also high.</p>\n<p>How could things go wrong?</p>",

The key figure in the party is undoubtedly Ko Wen-je, who enjoys substantial support from young people and swing voters. This support is precisely what the aging Kuomintang (KMT) urgently needs but struggles to attract. The KMT has long been seen as lacking support from the younger generation.

This is to prevent the splintering of pan-blue votes from the opposition alliance, as was the case in 2000. If the KMT aims to achieve a united front, it will require more than just a strong political party and favorable polling numbers. It must also address the demands of the Taiwan People's Party and various government reform requests, binding its fate with the Taiwan People's Party.

He is known as \"Uncle Ko\" or \" Ko P(rofessor).\" He served as the Mayor of Taipei City for two consecutive terms, the first time with the help of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), defeating Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan. The second time, as an independent candidate, he won a controversial election (commonly referred to as \"vote-counting while polling\") with a narrow margin of only 3,000 votes over the Kuomintang (KMT) candidate, Ting Shou-chung. <p>In 2019, Ko Wen-je established the Taiwan People's Party, quickly becoming the third-largest party in Taiwan, and announced his intention to build a new politics in Taiwan beyond the Blue-Green divide. The Taiwan People's Party is known as the White Force and won the mayoral position in Hsinchu City in the 2022 local elections. At the age of 64, Ko Wen-je is far from being a traditional politician. On the contrary, he enjoys great popularity among the younger generation, who constitute his main supporter base. Politically, he is also an unpredictable figure. Initially, he collaborated with the DPP to win the Taipei mayoral election and consistently supported green ideology. He once stated that the three things he hates the most in his life are cockroaches, mosquitoes, and the Kuomintang. </p>\n\n<p>Starting from 2018, he began criticizing the DPP and distancing himself from them. After the establishment of the Taiwan People's Party, Ko Wen-je became an undeniable figure on the political stage. He is highly likely to run for the presidency of the Republic of China (Taiwan) in 2024. Even if he doesn't win, he will undoubtedly leave his mark in history. Of course, the Taiwan People's Party is a small party, having been founded only a few years ago. Its influence nationwide is far less significant than the two major traditional parties. Its main supporters are limited to the younger generation and the online community, with almost no support from the older age groups. Many polls have shown that Ko Wen-je lacks support among the middle-aged and elderly population. Additionally, the party lacks campaign funding and resources. Its strength is slightly stronger in the northern region but weak in the central and southern regions. The Taiwan People's Party has clear advantages and disadvantages as a political party. Furthermore, the party heavily relies on Ko Wen-je's personal charisma rather than organizational capabilities and discipline. Apart from Ko Wen-je, the party has almost no nationally recognized figures. </p>\n<p>However, does the Taiwan People's Party really have to give up elections due to its lack of strength? We must bring new hope to Taiwanese politics, neither adhering to the Blue nor Green camp, but embracing a new color in Taiwanese politics: white. </p>\n<p><strong>Keep Promise, and believe in a better Taiwan.</strong></p>",

Born in Keelung in 1950, Zhao Shao-kang is a descendant of the Republic of China's military family with a complete Mainlander background. He has served as a legislator for three terms, a Taipei city councilor for two terms, and the director of the Environmental Protection Administration of the Executive Yuan. He has been dubbed the \"political prodigy\" in Taiwan's political arena. During his term as a legislator, he ran for the mayor of Taipei in 1994, but was defeated by Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party, gradually fading out of politics since then and entering the media industry, becoming the chairman and general manager of China Broadcasting Corporation.</p>\n\n<p>Zhao Shao-kang is a powerful debater, comparable to Han Kuo-yu, but unlike Han Kuo-yu, he does not attract too many attacks. This could compensate for Hou You-yi's shortcomings in debates and strengthen the Kuomintang's base. The combination of two males and Mainlanders/Taiwanese is also a classic campaign combination for the Kuomintang. President Ma Ying-jeou has chosen this pairing twice and won. Zhao Shao-kang also holds a negative view of the Chinese Communist Party's actions in Hong Kong and opposes the CCP's suppression of Taiwan, which can weaken the Democratic Progressive Party's red baiting of the Kuomintang.</p>\n\n<p>However, wanting him to join your camp is not that easy. Although he will provide you with a lot of media exposure and support, Zhao Shao-kang believes that only cooperation between the blue and white camps can achieve the goal of party alternation and winning. Therefore, he will not appear as your vice president until the last moment. In addition, a combination of two older blue males will not provide much motivation for young female voters. You must make efforts to strengthen in this aspect. If you choose Zhao Shao-kang, you must strive until the last moment. </p>",

In 2018, he overturned the Democratic Progressive Party and brought Kaohsiung under Kuomintang's control, breaking the record of consecutive terms held by the DPP in Kaohsiung, and sparked the \"Han Kuo-yu whirlwind\" in this deeply green region.   However, in 2019, with his running for re-election while in office, the chaos in the primary with Terry Gou, as well as the actions of the Chinese Communist Party in Hong Kong and a series of attacks from the DPP, Tsai Ing-wen set a record of 8.17 million votes, making history, while Han Kuo-yu only received 5.52 million votes.   Subsequently, outraged Kaohsiung residents ousted Han Kuo-yu from the mayor's position, making him a politician without public office.</p>\n\n<p>Despite Han Kuo-yu's high popularity and support from his dedicated fans, along with his ability to strengthen his core base, more centrist voters and young people either see him as a joke or feel he doesn't fit the image of a president.   Han Kuo-yu's political style is seen to lean towards populism, with some even labeling him as the \"Taiwanese Trump.\"   However, being a descendant of a Kuomintang military man like Zhao Shao-kang, Han Kuo-yu can strengthen your deep blue base.   The combination of Mainlander and local Taiwanese all-male tickets is also a classic winning strategy for the KMT.   Choosing Han Kuo-yu can also alleviate doubts from his supporters and address the issue of Hou's lack of active support during his 2020 campaign.</p>\n<p>However, it is important to note that Han Kuo-yu has previously engaged with the LOCPG and has had ambiguous relations with China.   Whether true or not, he could become a red bait to aid the DPP, leading them to revive their anti-Han strategies from 2020 to attack both you and Han Kuo-yu, causing division among voters.   Moreover, Han Kuo-yu is not well-received among centrist voters, and the pairing of two aged male politicians does not appeal to female voters.   Therefore, if you choose Han Kuo-yu, you must continuously strengthen your core base until the day of victory.   Be sure to carefully weigh the pros and cons and make wise decisions to achieve the ultimate goal of winning the election! </p>",

Ko Chih-en hails from the green region of Pingtung, where her father once served as the county mayor. Being two taiwanese in same tickets is not that common, which generally could affect the voting preferences of mainlanders and deep blue supporters. However, Ko Chih-en possesses a certain demeanor of mainlanders that can counterbalance these issues. She is also one of the female fighters of the Kuomintang in the southern region, having served as a legislator and being well-versed in legislative affairs.</P>\n<p>\nShe had also run as the Kuomintang's candidate for Mayor of Kaohsiung but was defeated by the Democratic Progressive Party incumbent Mayor Chen Chi-mai seeking reelection. Nevertheless, she set a record for the second-highest number of votes for a Kuomintang candidate for Kaohsiung Mayor after the merger of Kaohsiung County and City, leading the Kuomintang to maintain its position as the largest party in the council.</p>\nIf you want to launch a completely new and different campaign, one that stands out from all previous ones, and if you aim to garner more support from the younger generation and advocate for progressive values, then Ko Chih-en might be your best choice. She advocates for strengthening women's rights, LGBT rights, pension reforms, and has helped advance Taiwan's same-sex marriage legislation. While the Kuomintang generally opposes this legislation, she and representatives from the younger faction support it. Furthermore, as the issue of LGBT rights is not a major concern in Taiwan, it may not cause significant damage to your base. Being a university professor, she knows how to engage with young people daily. If you wish to bring in a new image for the Kuomintang and attract more young voters, choosing Ko Chih-en could help you achieve that.\n",

She is a descendant of the renowned Taiwanese conglomerate, Shin Kong Group. Her family background is very prominent, and she was born in the United States, making her a typical rich girl. Her English proficiency may even surpass her Mandarin and Taiwanese language skills, indicating she is a typical ABC (American-born Chinese).\n\n<p>So, what are the benefits of choosing her as the vice president? Obviously, the combination of her and you will attract the votes of many young people and female voters, who are your most enthusiastic supporters. Additionally, her family background and international connections can bring in more campaign funding for you.</p>\n\n<p>Having said that, everything has its pros and cons. Her political background consists of serving as a legislator for only two years, with very limited political experience. Furthermore, her background as a scion of a major conglomerate family may not be what you are seeking, as some of your supporters strongly dislike the image of politicians associated with big business interests, which could potentially impact your electoral chances.</p>",
