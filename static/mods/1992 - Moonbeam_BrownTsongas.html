    perotDropout:
        `
        Once a serious threat to capture the presidency, Ross Perot’s campaign has sputtered into terminal decline, especially given that you’ve echoed many of his major talking points. On Larry King Live, Perot abruptly announces that he’s dropping out of the race, refusing to endorse either candidate but vaguely suggesting you’re more of a force for change than Bush is. How do you react to this development?
    `
    ,
    aidsRibbon:
        `
        The AIDS crisis has risen dramatically in stature from a stigmatized gay disease to a mainstream political topic. In your public appearances, you’ve taken to wearing a red ribbon for AIDS awareness, but as the general election draws closer, many of your advisors, especially Jacques, are urging you to take a more defined stance. How do you respond?
    `
    ,
    barzaghi:
        `
        Jacques Barzaghi, a longtime advisor and close friend, has been caught on tape making some truly disgusting comments about women, threatening your image as a champion of equal rights. The GOP has screamed nonstop about Barzaghi’s words, and now, the mainstream media is starting to attach onto the story. You have to stop it before it gets too big to manage.
    `
    ,
    reproductiveRights:
        `
        One of the few things that helped you bridge the gap with Clinton was your support of reproductive rights, culminating in a 500,000 person march on Washington in April. Now, in a world where Planned Parenthood v. Casey has reinforced Roe while also adding in viability carveouts, the issue has been brought back to the forefront. How do you address it?
    `
    ,
    deficitHawk:
        `
        National surveys have consistently reported that Americans view the federal budget deficit as the single most pressing problem facing the country, with unemployment falling closely behind. As an avowed deficit hawk, you’re uniquely placed to take advantage of America’s obsession with getting into the black. The only question is how–Bush has already proved that increased taxes aren’t an option.
    `
    ,
    foreignPolicy:
        `
        Burdened with a struggling economy, Bush has struggled to find a way to spin it positively and has pivoted further into resurrecting the good memories from Desert Storm as a distraction. Although foreign policy’s importance in voters’ eyes has greatly declined since the Soviet Union collapsed, it remains one of the few areas where Bush has a clear advantage over you. How do you respond?
    `
    ,
    danQuayle:
        `
        On the doorstep of the GOP Convention, Dan Quayle is the gift that keeps on giving for the Democratic party, with his idiocy gaining media attention after a speech going after Murphy Brown as the nadir of the American family, cresting in a June incident where he misspelled “potato” with an e at the end. Your advisors unanimously agree that you need to exploit him even more than you already have. The only question is how.
    `
    ,
    bushRNC:
        `
        Bush walks onto the stage at the RNC, stiff as a board but looking prim and proper… presidential. With a grave tone of conviction in his voice, he addresses his message to America’s flag-burners, socialists, criminals, and to one specific Edmund G. Brown Jr. Your movement is a threat to law and order, to the country’s foundations, and must never succeed. His stern demeanor shakes a bit, betraying a hint of fear.
    `
    ,
    postGOPConvention:
        `
        As the race kicks off after the GOP convention, your candidacy, initially one on the fringe, has entered the political mainstream. Despite your strong showing so far, Bush still maintains a large fundraising advantage over you, even though you’ve been steadily closing the gap. How do you move forward from here?
    `
    ,
    nafta:
        `
        Since 1990, the United States, Canada, and Mexico have been on a path to passing and ratifying NAFTA. In each country, business and political clout is squarely in favor of the agreement, even though there’s a great deal of popular dissent. So far, you’ve danced around the issue, but Bush has aggressively campaigned on free trade, arguing the deal would be in peril with you in office. How do you respond?
    `
    ,
    education:
        `
        During the primaries, you explicitly called to abolish the Department of Education and spoke of cutting school budgets nationwide to drive “reform.” Since then, you’ve taken steps to portray yourself as much more pro-education, but this Reaganesque rhetoric has proven to be a burden, with Republicans seizing onto the issue and accusing you of being even more cruel than they are. How do you respond to them?
    `
    ,
    hurricaneAndrew:
        `
        In the middle of peak campaign season, a terrible tragedy has struck Florida in the form of Hurricane Andrew, the strongest, and if initial reports are to be believed, costliest hurricane to hit the country in decades. Federal aid has been slow to come, and in keeping up with the appearance of basic humanity, everyone expects you to pay the impacted areas a visit. How do you handle your trip?
    `
    ,
    foreignPolicyUltimatum:
        `
        Right now, George Bush is running like a man assured of victory, eager to repeat his landslide against Dukakis. One day, Jodie and Pat corner you and force you to look at a new poll whose findings claim that your poor polling performance is due to the widespread perception that Bush knows how to lead the nation on the world stage better than you do. They issue an ultimatum: do something, anything, about foreign policy, or they leave the campaign.
    `
    ,
    internationalTripReturn:
        `
        You’ve come back from your international trip in high spirits, feeling fresh and ready to spend the rest of the election campaigning. The first thing you’re greeted with upon arrival is a nationwide poll suggesting that you’re in position to capture 65% of the under-30 vote; likewise, attack ads start airing that paint you as more of a liberal than ever, matched by a more populist economic tone from Bush. How do you respond?
    `
    ,
    debatePrep:
        `
        For the last three days, you’ve been locked inside Max Pavelsky’s mansion in Beverly Hills, obsessively practicing for the debate with Senator Brock Adams playing the role of Bush. With Bush only agreeing to one debate, Jodie and Pat believe this is your last, best chance to reshape that race’s narrative in your favor. How do you do that?
    `
    ,
    clintonWarning:
        `
        Making his way through the swing states as a loyal Democratic partisan, Bill Clinton has nothing but good things to say about you, praising your leadership and vision. Yet, even as you run into him backstage during a rally in Davenport, you can’t help but think that his eyes seem a bit lifeless, glassy, like that of a shark. You have to make sure that he’s not trying anything.
    `
    ,
    pollingConcerns:
        `
        You’re keeping a brave face, but you worry that at any moment, that the bottom could fall out. The polls are bad, and Bush is on a rampage, blasting you and everything you stand for. Your one hope is that Jodie and co. believe that the polling is failing to capture the disengaged people you’re speaking out to, and that they’ll come home come November. You wish you could believe them.
    `
    ,
    octemberSurprise:
        `
        Right before the election, Bush’s team has concocted an incredulous October surprise in the form of a redux of the charges that you held drug parties in your house as governor. It’s complete nonsense, but the documents have been manufactured, the false accusers have already been instructed. The media shows signs of latching on despite your denial. With so little time remaining, how do you address this issue?
    `
    ,
    finalStretch:
        `
        Everything you’ve worked for, fought for, has all come down to this. November 3rd is soon approaching, and you have one last chance to plead your case, one final stretch of campaigning before your rendezvous with destiny. The only question is this: where exactly do you want to go?

                      <p><em>Nov. 4, 1992</em></p><p>Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas was elected the 42nd President of the United States yesterday, breaking a 12-year Republican hold on the White House.</p><p>Mr. Clinton shattered the Republicans’ political base with a promise of change to an electorate clearly discontented with President Bush.</p><p>With Bush’s high approval ratings, many pundits assumed that he would sail to reelection. Many speculated potential Democratic candidates chose not to run, with Mario Cuomo focusing on his governorship and Jerry Brown choosing to run a successful Senate campaign instead. This sparse field of candidates allowed Governor Clinton to run for the nomination practically uncontested, with his most prominent opposition in the form of Senator Paul Tsongas dropping out after underperforming on Super Tuesday.</p>

                      <p>Clinton’s ability to easily unite the party behind him has been cited as a large contributor in his strong performance yesterday.<br><br>Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who roiled this race throughout, finished third, drawing roughly equally from both major party candidates, according to Voter Research & Surveys, the television polling consortium. His share of the popular vote had the potential to exceed any third-party candidate’s in more than half a century.</p><p>The Governor from Arkansas won such big, closely contested states as Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Illinois. As polls closed across the nation, networks announced projected winners based on voter surveys. It was Ohio that put him over the top shortly before 11 P.M., followed closely by California. Based on those projections, Mr. Bush prevailed in his adopted state of Texas and other pockets of Republican states around the country.</p><p>In a victory speech to a joyous crowd in Little Rock, Mr. Clinton declared, ‘On this day, with high hopes and brave hearts, in massive numbers, the American people have voted to make a new beginning.’</p>

                  Tucked away in the penthouse suite at the Fairmont in San Francisco, Jerry Brown was incapable of talking about politics, and although he thought about it, obsessed over it, nonstop, he flatly refused to talk about anything related to the election. Jacques called from France, occupied with personal business that required his presence in Paris, and the two of them talked about cinema for 30 minutes, not mentioning the election once. Even when Pat came around, touting the extremely promising exit polls, and Jodie brought forth a massive collection of anecdotes showcasing sky-high enthusiasm at the polling booths, Jerry waved them off, instead choosing to focus on Showdown at Gucci Gulch, an interesting book a reporter in New Hampshire had recommended to him.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  After dinner, which was a decidedly simple affair of rice and beans, he finally decided that the time had come and turned on the television. He landed on CBS, where Dan Rather was interpolating updates on the vote count with quick interviews with various figures, talking about fairly bland topics such as why people choose to vote the way they do. Already, the map was mostly colored blue, with margins in the safe states beyond the campaign’s highest expectations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  The blue began to spread across the nation, sweeping the swing states and refusing to stop there, creeping into several states that he thought he’d need a miracle to win in. Even though they hadn’t called it yet, he knew it was about to happen: Jerry Brown was going to be president of the United States of America. He sat back in his chair, taking it all in, as the emotions that he had been holding in for so long began slowly seeping out of him, briefly reducing him to a quivering heap.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  As the networks called electoral vote 270, a surge of jubilation swept the suite. Jodie was literally bouncing up and down with excitement, screaming at nobody for the sheer purpose of expressing her joy. Stewart Brand, back from a transcendental trip somewhere, was leading a toast of a whole group of celebrities who had flown in from Beverly Hills, a group of people so collectively famous that they inevitably phased together into one bloc of limelight. Pat Caddell was out on the balcony, drinking something obscenely expensive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry, having finally worked through his emotions, got up, forcing his way through a buzzing throng of people eager to congratulate him, and made his way to a bathroom, where he locked himself in. He turned on the faucets and threw a bit of cold water on his face, then forced himself to look in the mirror. 54 years old, hair thinning, wrinkles growing, he was a far cry from the electrifying young man he had been back when he was new to the game, when he had been more celebrity than politician. But the middle-aged man looking back at him in the mirror had something in his eyes that the young man didn’t have, a sort of imperceptible strength that could only come from the realization that he had gone from a washed-up also-ran to the most powerful man in the world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  He wasn’t entering office in some sort of fluke or some sort of hypercompetitive race decided at the margins. No, he had blown Bush out of the water, taking him down along with the entire confederacy of corruption, careerism, and campaign consulting. He had asked the people, begged them with all of his heart, to do the right thing and take back America. And they had listened. Now, he would be entering the White House with a mandate, with a Democratic House and Senate which owed their huge margins to him directly. As vast and deep-rooted as the problems facing the country were, he had been given the tools to fix them. It was all in his hands now.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry unlocked the bathroom door and entered into a state of pandemonium, with everyone rushing towards him, just trying to get the tiniest piece of the new president. This time, he obliged them, slowly making his way through the crowd with a smile, one that for the first time in far too long, was reflected in his eyes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Someone shoved a phone at him, and he picked it up. He knew exactly who was on the other line, an old, defeated, corrupt shell of a man whose power as commander-in-chief was reduced to being forced to follow a stupid tradition.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  “Well, Governor–I mean, President-elect–Brown, I guess I’d call to congratulate you. I hope you’re doing well at this time, and I want to let you know that you’ll have our full support in creating a smooth transition of power.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  “Yeah, thank you, that’s great.” There was no point in trying to one-up Bush. As much as he despised the man and despised the things he had done, the voters had already done the job of destroying Bush for him. There was no point in twisting the knife.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  “Regardless of our differences, I just want to say good luck as president. It’s a difficult job, and you’re going to have to make some big decisions. So, once again, good luck.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  “Thank you very much, Mr. President. I’m sure that we’ll meet pretty soon and have a chance to talk some more.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  With that, the phone was whisked away, and he went back through the crowd. Someone had brought a speaker in, and they were playing some sort of new hip hop song, a vapid energetic thing meant to convey the energy of the room. Jump, that was the name of it. It fit the occasion well enough. Someone had crafted a makeshift stage for him out of a few boxes and chairs, and he got up for a quick address to the crowd. He thanked them for their support, promised to keep his promises to everyone, and thanked them again. It was nothing too special, but the people were jubilant anyway.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Soon enough, he had men in suits whisking him out of the room and to a waiting car. In 30 minutes, he had an official victory speech to give in Union Square, the same place that his campaign had started. As he rolled through the bright-lit streets of the city where he had grown up, sharing the back of the car with Jodie, who was focused on furiously writing down notes in a little address book and was paying no attention to him, he finally used some of the Buddhist tactics he had learned and took a deep, self-centering breath.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  His time as a private citizen, a man without any responsibility other than to himself, was over. Now, a nation of 250 million people, the world’s only superpower, was at his feet. He had promised so many things and brought forth so many grand designs, and now, he had no excuses not to enact them. Over the next four years, the challenges that he had faced as governor were only going to be multiplied on an enormous scale. The American people had overwhelmingly chosen him to alleviate their ailments, and he was going to do his absolute best to do just that.

                  The car arrived at Union Square, lit up in colors of red, white, and blue and filled with crowds chanting his name, expecting their newfound hero to address them with news of his victory. It was to be his first challenge as President. Before he got out of the car, he straightened his tie and said a silent prayer. He didn’t care if it was to Catholic god, Buddhist spirits, or a cold, uncaring universe, but he needed to say something worthy of the moment. Then, he got out of the car and stepped into the light and noise of the cheering mass of people. It was time to get to work.

                  <p>
                  Tucked away in the penthouse suite at the Fairmont in San Francisco, Jerry Brown was incapable of talking about politics, and although he thought about it, obsessed over it, nonstop, he flatly refused to talk about anything related to the election. Jacques called from France, occupied with personal business that required his presence in Paris, and the two of them talked about their interpretation of The Satanic Verses for 30 minutes, not mentioning the election once. Even when Pat came around, reporting good news from the Michigan exit poll, and Jodie came in asking if he had any ideas what a victory speech might look like, he waved them off and focused on watching the JFK movie, which he somehow had missed in theaters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  After dinner, a nice cream of mushroom soup, he finally decided that the time had come and turned on the television. He landed on CBS, where Dan Rather was interpolating updates on the vote count with quick interviews with various figures, talking about fairly bland topics such as why people choose to vote the way they do. As the results came in, it was tough to tell, but it looked like the right states were tilting his way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  For hours, Jerry was glued to the screen, watching results come in and taking a few calls from fellow politicians. The necessary states started to tilt blue, and then progressively bluer and bluer, until they were being called for him. He began creeping closer and closer to 270, until, suddenly, he was there: Jerry Brown was the next president. The suite was cheerful, with people hugging each other and toasting to the end of 12 years of Republican rule. Jodie was bubbly, just taking in the entire experience. In the corner, Pat simply had a massive grin on his face, confidently letting the energy of the room fuel his belief that he was completely right about Jerry the whole time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry himself was content to simply let it all sink in. It had been 14 long years since 1978, and he was glad that he had finally chalked up another victory for himself. He walked out onto the suite’s balcony for a moment, to take in the fresh air. Below, he could hear the sounds of people hollering with joy, of loud music blaring and car horns honking in the street as people celebrated the elevation of one of their own to the presidency.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  When he walked back into the suite, someone held out a phone for him. He knew exactly who it was from, and picked it up. This one was going to be very satisfactory.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  “President-elect–Brown, I think that congratulations are in order. You did a good job out there, and I promise you that my administration will help make the transition as easy as possible.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  “But of course, Mr. President,” said Jerry, wanting Bush to hear every syllable of what he said, “it would be my pleasure. My people will be in touch with yours to help figure all of this out. It’s a very multidimensional process.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  “That’s certainly… certainly true, Governor Brown. I should get going soon, because there’s a lot going on over here. But good luck in office. Congratulations.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  “Absolutely, absolutely. We’ll have plenty more chances to talk when it’s not as busy.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Bush hung up, and Jerry handed the phone back to whoever had given it to him in the first place. Now was the time to gloat, although he didn’t want to linger on it for longer than necessary. He gathered everyone in a rough circle around him, making sure that he had everyone’s attention. As he learned, that wasn’t so difficult when you were the president. He said a few words, thanking everyone for their hard work. People didn’t really care about the specifics so much as they were glad that their chosen man was the one basking in the light of victory, and they cheered him on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  After saying his goodbyes, Jerry made his way to the exit and was whisked away to a car, the exact type of hulking, expensive beast that he had tried to get rid of as governor. At the moment, it didn’t matter too much. He had a victory speech to give in 20 minutes, in Union Square, and he could afford just a little bit of profligacy on such an important night. As he rolled through the dark streets, Jodie the only one there to keep him company, it started to dawn on him that nothing was ever going to be the same. He was president now, the newest member of the world’s most exclusive fraternity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  He thought back to his family for a moment. As much he lived in his father’s shadow, the equation was incomplete without his mother. He remembered how her story had started, that her grandfather had left Germany in 1849, departing from Hamburg on a ship called “Perseverance.” He didn’t know what specifically he believed, but he did believe that was a good sign. He was certain that the presidency wouldn’t be a primrose path, but he had faith that he was capable of navigating it safely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  As the car pulled up to Union Square, cheers filling the air, he tried to do a bit of planning for the future. He had campaigned on taking back America, and he had been given the tools to make it happen. Still, there were enemies out there, and he would have to watch his back if he didn’t want to become a new Carter. There were many, many logistical elements to think of. As he got out of the car, though, he brushed all of that off. There were thousands of people gathered to meet their new president, chanting his name like he was more of a pop star than a politician. And so, he started walking to the mic, aware that the show had to go on.

              Tucked away in the penthouse suite at the Fairmont in San Francisco, Jerry Brown was incapable of talking about politics, and although he thought about it, obsessed over it, nonstop, he flatly refused to talk about anything related to the election. Jacques called from France, occupied with personal business that required his presence in Paris, and the two of them talked about their thoughts on the next year’s most like Nobel Prize winners for 30 minutes, not mentioning the election once. Even when Pat came around, claiming that the microdata had some positive trends, and Jodie came in asking if there was anything he’d like to record for posterity , he waved them off and focused on the new Madonna album, which two of his staffers had begged him to listen to.
              </p>
              <p>
              After dinner, a fairly well-cooked pork chop, he finally decided that the time had come and turned on the television. He landed on CBS, where Dan Rather was interpolating updates on the vote count with quick interviews with various figures, talking about fairly bland topics such as why people choose to vote the way they do. As the results came in, it was tough to tell, enough that he held off on getting excited about anything.
              </p>
              <p>
              Hours passed, and Jerry was one with the television, not letting anyone come into the room who wasn’t the closest of confidants. The safe states were called, then the solid ones, then the leaning ones, then the tossups until both campaigns were in striking distance of 270. Then, all of a sudden, something clicked, and the results all came in–with him ahead. It had taken a while, but Jerry Brown had won the election. The suite was happy, albeit in a slightly nervous way, more they had avoided bad news than received good news. Jodie was grinning in a tired way, crow’s feet showing, while Pat was slowly walking around the room in circles, muttering to himself in a way hat made him seem like he didn’t want to be bothered.
              </p>
              <p>
              Jerry just sat there, running it over in his head. He was the winner, and Bush was the loser. Shouldn’t that be good enough? He had come back from the void, with nothing, and now everyone was saying something. In a few months, he would be the unquestioned most powerful man in the world, at the helm of the world’s only superpower. But was it enough? Perhaps.
              </p>
              <p>
              He walked back into the room, and waved down an aide who had a working telephone. There was a call awaiting, and he very much wanted to check it off the list.
              </p>
              <p>
              “Governor, future President Brown, I wanted to just give you a call, send in my submission. It was a tough thing, but I have to suspend my campaign at this moment. It’s tight, but I think it’s over by now. No recounts or anything like that will be necessary.”
              </p>
              <p>
              “I understand, Mr. President,”said Brown, letting the words flow out of him instead of trying to force something that wasn’t there, “these are the decisions that we have to make. You can rest well knowing that you did a good job.”
              </p>
              <p>
              A low snarling sound came over the receiver, as if Bush didn’t quite agree with that summation.”Sure thing, Mr. President. Whatever you say. A good, close race, am I right?”
              </p>
              <p>
              “Oh yes, 100%. I have a lot of people waiting on me, but we can discuss this more later.”
              </p>
              <p>
              Jerry hung up on him after saying to basic pleasantries, and set the phone down. It was now time to be serious. It was time to step up and prove that he had been elected president for a reason, that he wasn’t some mistake or fluke or anything like that. He gathered everyone around for a speech, making sure to let them know how he felt and how grateful he was, as a real president, duly elected by the people, should. It was over quickly and painlessly, people ready to listen to their new president.
              </p>
              <p>
              Jerry let himself be whisked away, let himself be carried through the crowd until he was in a car heading to Union Square with Jodie, en route to a victory speech. At this point, it just didn’t feel real at all. In the logical part of his mind, he knew that the ores had been counted and he had won, but emotionally, he still didn’t feel it yet. Right now, he felt the exact same way he had before Election Day, just another soul among billions of others.
              </p>
              <p>
              He thought back to the other presidents that had been elected narrowly. Carter had been a disaster, one that he had little desire to emulate. Kennedy had been a success, minus the whole death thing, but Jerry had never been much of a Kennedy guy. Maybe he could be the new Woodrow Wilson? Was that something he really wanted to be? Probably not, all things considered. Maybe he would just have to be Jerry Brown. It was something he knew how to do, but that didn’t make it any less scary.
              </p>
              <p>
              At long last, the car pulled up to Union Square, the streets buzzing with those wishing to catch a glimpse of their new leader. So that was exactly what he was going to do: be that leader, be the person that millions of Americans had wanted him to be. They had placed their faith in him, so now, he was going to have to somehow pay it back. It was going to be hard, coming into office without a bit mandate, without the sort of steam that could power massive change. He was going to have to do it all himself. Well, it wasn’t anything he hadn’t done before. And so, just like that, Jerry Brown exited the car and got ready to reintroduce himself as President.</p>

                  <p>
                  The Brown team had checked themselves into the penthouse of the Fairmont in downtown San Francisco, but Jerry  himself was nowhere to be seen. Ever since they had arrived from the airport, he went straight to the master bedroom and shut himself in. Jacques tried calling him, and Jerry hung up immediately. Jodie and Pat both came by to give him different variations of telling him that the race would be tight, and that he would likely have to stay up late. He nodded briefly and shooed them away.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry was too nervous to stomach anything at all for dinner, and instead slowly drank a tall glass of water–even that was a hard task–as he prepared himself to watch the election results. Jerry had a special talent, one that he had never told anyone about, to predict elections based purely on his gut. He had never been wrong. But now, as he sat alone in his hotel room, he couldn’t find anything to tell him which way the wind was blowing. His senses had failed him.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  The broadcast started, and from the get-go, Jerry could tell that it was going to be a close one. Blow for blow, he and Bush traded blue and red shots all across the electoral map, one never pulling out too far ahead from the other. Both men got closer and closer to the promised land of 270 and the presidency. Then, all of a sudden, they made the last calls, and everything became instantly clear: they had deadlocked at 269 apiece.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry decided to finally exit the hotel room, where he was greeted by a suite filled with people in various states of disassociation. Everyone had prepared for the possibility of a win or a loss, but even with the polls showing a tight race, even with the possibility of a deadlock being completely in the realm of probability, not one single person had thought to actually consider the possibility. The room was silent: not the depressed silence of a funeral, but the confused silence of someone who had just woken up from getting their wisdom teeth taken out, completely out of touch with reality.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry made his way through the room, the people parting for him. Nobody was willing to shake his hand in congratulations or pat his back in remorse. Instead, he just walked through a confused room of political operators, acquaintances of him, Hollywood celebrities, and others who had been reduced to zombies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry saw one single emotional face in the room, and made a beeline towards it. It was Pat, smirking with glee. When Jerry arrived, Pat gave him a bone-crushing handshake.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  “Congratulations, Mr. President,” he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry stopped to think about it. Pat was right, wasn’t he? If the electoral college fell short of any candidate receiving a majority, then the election would be decided based on state delegations in the House. And who controlled the state delegations in the House? The Democratic party. In theory, if everything went to plan, he had it in the bag.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  In theory, in theory, in theory. Deep down, the little part of his gut that made the election calls gave him a sign: he had won, but he needed to tread lightly. This wasn’t over yet. It had just begun.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry’s eyes drifted away from Pat and over to a phone that was sitting on a table, just waiting to be used. Any moment now, Bush would be calling to offer his concession, right? Jerry only waited a couple seconds, but that was all he needed for his gut to send him another signal. The call was never going to come.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry ran his hands through his thinning hair and tried to get himself reoriented. He found a stool to stand on, got up, and raised his voice, immediately catching everyone’s attention. In no uncertain terms, he explained the situation: the election was deadlocked, but he was on track to win it eventually. He thanked everyone for their support, but noted that he technically wasn’t president-elect yet. People cheered, some louder than others, as the spell of disassociation finally wore off, but it was a far cry from the sort of reaction he knew he would’ve gotten if he had been able to snag one more electoral vote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  After the speech, he knew that he was going to have to go on television soon and talk about the situation. That could wait. Instead, he headed to the balcony and took a moment to take in the San Francisco skyline. It really was bullshit, this antiquated electoral system. A better country founded on better values, or even an equally bad one whose founders had been just a little more flexible with the requirements to amend the Constitution, would’ve ditched the electoral college long ago. But just like the what if of him winning one more electoral vote, it was meaningless. Reality had arrived, and he needed to move on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry sighed, letting the breath exit his lungs completely, using one of the mediation tricks he had picked up in Japan. This turn of events had seriously impacted his plans. All of his grand ideas about riding into the presidency with a mandate had vanished. But what else was he going to do? Nothing? Of course not.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry breathed back in. Now was the time, more than ever, to lock it down. The road ahead was treacherous, filled with all sorts of obstacles meant to stop him. That was nothing new. He had been down this road before, and still managed to come out straight. It was hard, but he was harder. He had long dreamed of the presidency, and now it was right there. Instead of letting the obstacles drag him down, he set his shoulders back and straightened his posture. If they–and they meant anything to him, from the American people to the electoral college to the Constitution–wanted a fight, then bring it on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry walked back into the hotel room, ready to face the public for the first time. There was no more time for worrying over the results. The next phase had begun, and he was ready to do what it took to win.

                  <p>
                  Tucked away in the penthouse suite at the Fairmont in San Francisco, Jerry Brown was incapable of talking about politics, and although he thought about it, obsessed over it, nonstop, he flatly refused to talk about anything related to the election. Jacques called from France, occupied with personal business that required his presence in Paris, and the two of them talked about the World Series and its implications on the wider realm of baseball for 30 minutes, not mentioning the election once. Even when Pat came around, trying to start a discussion on how some of the folks on the ground were seeing odd signs, and Jodie came in discussing what he would have to do in the case of a tight victory, he waved them off and focused on reading some Camus, who had always intrigued him.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  After dinner, a bass filet with asparagus on the side, he finally decided that the time had come and turned on the television. He landed on CBS, where Dan Rather was interpolating updates on the vote count with quick interviews with various figures, talking about fairly bland topics such as why people choose to vote the way they do. As the results came in, things were looking slightly less optimal than he had hoped.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  For hours, Jerry stressed over the results, calling everyone with a brain that he knew to see what his chances were. Then, sometime in the early morning, they finally counted up all the votes, and that was that. Jerry Brown had lost. As he finally exited the room and entered into the suite, the faint traces of daylight had already arrived. Everyone was sad–Jody was lightly crying, Pat was rubbing his temples–but everyone seemed less generally distraught and more like they had lost a boxing match on a split decision and didn’t know what to think. He looked around, and nobody even seemed to recognize that he was there. He shrugged and walked over to the phone, typing in the numbers to a special line in Houston.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  “President Bush,” said Jerry, in the most emotionless, lawyerly tone he had, “it looks like congratulations are in order.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  “I appreciate that, Governor. You know, that’s probably the closet-fun thing we’ve had in some years. That’s how it goes, I guess.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry could sense the fear in his voice, the gnawing sense that Bush had escaped from the election rather than won it. “Yeah, I just tried to do my best, and that wasn’t good enough this time. Almost. Maybe some other time.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Busy audibly shrugged, not sure what to say. “That’s life. It’s definitely something that I’ve had the time to learn over the years. But we can discuss this at some other time. I’m old, and I need a break.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry said some pleasantries, and then hung up. It was only fair to let the old bastard get his rest. Jerry wasn’t the youngest man either, and he had the motions to go through. First, everyone still left in the suite was treated to a very simple and short thank you speech in which Jerry said the absolute bare minimum necessary and offered his condolences. It was the least they deserved.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Then came the concession speech, which was more of the same. Lots of people voted for him, enough to win massive swathes of the population, enough to build an army of millions of Brown voters, but it wasn’t enough. Compared to where he had started, it was something to be proud of, but he would end right where he originated, without office, without power. Finally, the cameras shut off, and he excused himself from public life.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  By this point, it was well and truly daytime, and yet he didn’t feel tired at all. He found his way into a car with a driver, and simply asked to go south. And just like that, Jerry was just another of one of the millions of souls in California fighting their way through the morning’s traffic. Slowly, the hectic energy of the bay receded until it was only a glimmer of light on the highway and not the all-encompassing force of downtown.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  The car stopped, and all of a sudden, Jerry remembered where he was and why he had come here. Los Gatos was a small town, but it contained a place hat was very special to him, the novitiate where he had spent all those years back when he had harbored dreams of becoming a priest. Maybe he should have continued down that path, he thought. It could’ve saved him a lot of trouble.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  And yet, he wasn’t as troubled as he thought he would be. His normal reaction to a loss was to start plotting, or failing that, to collapse if the loss was bad enough. But there was none of that. It hurt, but not badly enough to cripple him. No, he just needed guidance. He didn’t know if he wanted to do this whole politics thing anymore–except maybe he did. He didn’t know if he wanted anything at all–or if he wanted everything. So, with that, he got out of the car and walked towards the church. He just needed a bit of guidance.

                  Tucked away in the penthouse suite at the Fairmont in San Francisco, Jerry Brown was incapable of talking about politics, and although he thought about it, obsessed over it, nonstop, he flatly refused to talk about anything related to the election. Jacques called from France, occupied with personal business that required his presence in Paris, and the two of them talked about the Sinead O’Connor incident for 30 minutes, not mentioning the election once. Even when Pat came around, trying to start a discussion on how some of the exit polls looked a bit worrying, and Jodie came in discussing how his paths to victory might work, he waved them off and focused on watching Feed, a new documentary chronicling the Democratic primaries earlier in the year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  After dinner, a pleasant pasta alfredo with extra parmesan, he finally decided that the time had come and turned on the television. He landed on CBS, where Dan Rather was interpolating updates on the vote count with quick interviews with various figures, talking about fairly bland topics such as why people choose to vote the way they do. As the results came in, some of the states looked promising, but just as many looked quite the opposite.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  For hours, Jerry alternated between watching the returns on television and taking phone calls, as his chances of pulling it off got narrower, narrower, and narrower. Then, the last state necessary for 270 flipped red, and his chances completely extinguished. That was it: Jerry Brown was not going to be the president. The mood of the suite sunk into a deep depression as people tried to figure out just where they had gone wrong. Jodie had her head in her hands, and Pat was muttering about how he couldn’t possibly understand how Jerry had failed, even after following his advice. Most people in the room, including the celebrities and various personal friends, had a palpable sense of anxiety sitting deep in their stomach, as they tried to wrestle with their grief.
                  </p>
				  <p>
                  Jerry had that exact same sense of grief, but he worked on shoving it down as far as possible, deep into the inner reaches of his soul, until the only thing left was his mind, unhindered by bothersome emotions. Wordlessly, he held his arm out for the phone, and someone was perceptive enough to hand it to him. One by one, he punched the numbers until Houston was on the line.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  “Mr. President,” said Jerry, his voice betraying just as much emotion as he felt, “Congratulations on your victory.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  “Well, thank you, Governor Brown. You did a good job and represented yourself well.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry could tell that Bush was enjoying the win, but he didn’t care about the process very much. To him, the electoral side of politics was all like one massive game, where he had to guess the right combinations so that he could get back to the real important job of actually being the executive. “At the end of the day, that’s how the swing of the pendulum goes. Maybe it goes somewhere else in four years, but that won’t be your problem. So, with that, good luck.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Bush laughed a little, genuinely chuckling. “You’re absolutely right about that one. Barbara is calling me over, but take care now.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry hung up the phone and took a moment to collect his thoughts so that he could plan his next few moves. First, he had to do the speech to the people in the room who had supported him so much. That was the first step. He gathered everyone around and used his last burst of passion to give them all a spirited thank-you, praising their hard work and their loyalty and promising that this wouldn’t be the end of the road. Everyone gently applauded.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  After that, he had the official televised concession speech. He didn’t spend too much time ruminating, instead hitting the expected points and making sure not to come off like too much of a sore loser. There was applause, and a few people, still obviously not over the loss, kept clapping longer than normal. And then, after that, there was really nothing else to do.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  He thought about going home, but his method of burying everything had left his mind pacing too quickly to calm down. When he got into the car, he told the driver to just go west, until he hit the ocean. After some time navigating through the streets, they finally got to Ocean Beach. Jerry thanked the driver and told him to come back in 30 minutes; he needed some time to think.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  The moon, not quite full but on its way there, illuminated the Pacific Ocean, its gentle waves putting Jerry into a trance. It was true: he had lost the election. He had lost elections before, just as his father had lost before, just like countless other politicians had. Granted, this one stung: if you squinted at the margins hard enough, conjured a few shifts in the right states, it may very well have been winnable. But still, he had tried his hardest and crafted an entire campaign, an entire movement, out of nothing, and a few people really had listened.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  He looked out across the water, the vast reach of the ocean swallowing his vision. He was down, but he wasn’t out. Running it back in 1996 seemed a tall order, especially with Clinton, probably also Cuomo in the mix, but there were endless opportunities out there, both in and out of office. He felt, more than ever, that even if he never was able to capture the presidency, he could at least do some good in the world. As he stared out across the water, imagining his gaze stretching endlessly across the whole Pacific, all the way to Japan, he became even more sure. He didn’t know when, where, or how, but he knew who: Jerry Brown would return.

                  <h2>PRESIDENT PEROT ANNOUNCES CURE FOR CANCER</h2><br>
                  <h4>AP News</h4>
                  <h4>Dee Lou Zhonal</h4>
                  <h4>February 29, 1996</h4>

                  <p>WASHINGTON D.C. – In a press conference yesterday, President Ross Perot announced that government researchers had developed a cure for cancer. In a 30-minute address, complete with a wide array of charts, Perot discussed the administration’s achievement, noting that the breakthrough had come after he let a National Institute of Health research team borrow his work.</p>

                  <p>“The other day, I had some NIH boys over at the White House, telling me that they had been working real hard on a cure for cancer but just kept running into walls,” said President Perot. “So I said, ‘hey, wait a minute, I’ve had some thoughts on this before and written down a few formulas. Give me one minute, and I’ll let you take a peep at them.’ And those NIH boys, they were so happy to see what I had written, and told me that it just might be what they needed. So, a couple days later, here we are.”</p>

                  <p>The press conference was scheduled as a last-minute addition to the White House’s agenda following the normal weekly press conference, where Perot discussed the administration's plans to convert the entire American power grid to cold fusion by the end of the year. However, given the momentous occasion, Perot deemed it best to let journalists know of the milestone as soon as possible.</p>

                  <p>Per the details shared by the White House, the cure for cancer looks similar to an aspirin pill. The pill, which only requires its users to take it a single time, will prevent cancer in those who do not have the disease, while those who do have the disease should expect to see their cancer gone completely in about 20 minutes after taking the pill. On stage, Perot took the pill himself, announcing that he had “never felt better.”</p>

                  <p>“This thing should market for about $0.56 a pop, according to what my people are telling me,” said President Perot. “Now, I know that’s a bit pricey compared to the cure for AIDS that we rolled out last year, but I think it’ll be worth it.”</p>

                  <p>Following the press conference, Perot flew to Dallas, where he maintains a home, for a period of rest and relaxation. Though Perot often takes lengthy breaks from the White House to focus on his personal life, many Americans feel that it is worth it, a belief reflected in his 93% approval rating. Following his three-day stay in Dallas, Perot will embark on an international tour to Israel, where he will officially sign off on a pact between Israel and Palestine that will end the conflict and create a sovereign Palestinian state.</p>

				<p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify;">
					May 16th’s episode of the hit series <em>Breaking Bad</em>, “Kafkaesque,” was a relatively slow episode for a series full of twists and turns, mostly centering around Walter and Skyler paying for Hank’s medical bills while Jesse deals with money issues. The episode was well-received, watched by 1.65 million people and garnering positive reviews from critics. However, it was the antics of side character Saul Goodman which set the internet on fire, punctuated by scores of humorous posts on Facebook and various blogs, especially in the form of an image macro of Saul winking while holding a bottle of nail polish.
				</p>

				<p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify;">
					Specifically, the reactions come from a scene where Jesse visits Saul at the nail salon, looking for advice on what to do with his ill-gotten gains, with Saul suggesting money laundering as an effective way to avoid the IRS. However, Saul goes one step further and points to fraud sometimes being an unambiguous positive good, using the example of committing voter fraud on behalf of George Bush in the 2000 Presidential election. The concept that Saul Goodman stole the 2000 election for Bush has gone viral, to the extent that celebrities like Lady Gaga and Justin Timberlake have started cracking jokes about it.
				</p>

				<p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify;">
					For residents of New Mexico, however, the story of the 2000 election is no laughing matter. Rather, it conjures images of a media firestorm that such a small state was completely unprepared for at that time, bringing in a degree of attention that would go completely unmatched until <em>Breaking Bad’s</em> premiere eight years later.
				</p>

				<div style="background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #8b0000; margin: 20px 0; font-style: italic;">
					<p style="margin: 0; font-size: 16px; color: #444;">
					“The scrutiny was everywhere... before that, you would generally have a contingent come in for the Balloon Festival, mostly for photos, and then leave. Then, the election came, and it was impossible to get a hotel room...”
					</p>
					<div style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal;">— Jim Baca, Mayor of Albuquerque (1997-2001)</div>
				</div>

				<p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify;">
					The state’s first brush with the political spotlight came earlier in the year, when Jerry Brown held his last rally for his 2000 campaign for the Democratic nomination for president, in a move that many had at first deemed quixotic, before his victory in New Hampshire made it suddenly pragmatic and sparked a race to the wire with Gore. Although Brown always lagged behind Gore, he was able to take in a respectable 38.7% of the overall vote and was largely credited with shifting Gore’s campaign rightwards on fiscal issues and leftwards on social issues, underscored by Gore’s decision to pick anti-tax New Hampshire governor Jeanne Shaheen as running mate.
				</p>

				<p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify;">
					It was in Albuquerque that Brown, who needed a miracle to have won on the final day of the primaries, ultimately was forced to end his campaign, and in Albuquerque that Brown would end up emphatically endorsing Gore for president and beginning a process of barnstorming the nation for the nominee. However, the real drama was only beginning. Throughout the presidential race, polls of the state were exceptionally rare compared to those of more vote-heavy swing states. Although all of these polls showed a dead heat between Bush and Gore, and most professional analysts had the state marked as a tossup, it was a surprise to many on November 7 when New Mexico was listed as too close to call as every other state in the country slowly trickled towards counting a winner.
				</p>

				<p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify;">
					From there on, the rest is history: the state’s initial vote was counted for Gore, making him the president by 128 votes–at least initially. An automatic recount found the margin even tighter, at 74 votes in Gore’s favor. From that point, the Bush campaign requested a manual recount in San Juan, Sandoval, and Chaves counties, and the Gore campaign aggressively countersued to stop the recounts as the case made its way higher in court, with the New Mexico Supreme Court voting to stop the recount and the New Mexico state legislature pledging its electors to Gore.
				</p>

				<p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify;">
					However, the Bush campaign appealed the case to the United States Supreme Court, where the 5-4 conservative majority ruled that the recount could continue, ultimately garnering a 203-vote victory for Bush. Albuquerque, meanwhile, was in flames, as protestors in Bernalillo County, a swing county at that time, protested that their state’s sovereignty was being stolen from it. Ultimately, Bush would go on to serve as president for the next eight years, though he would come up short in the state in 2004 by seven percentage points.
				</p>

				<p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify;">
					For Albuquerque residents, the election has since gone down in infamy, and even discussing Obama’s 18-point victory in the state doesn’t ease the pain. “It’s fucking ridiculous,” said local resident Bill Crawford, “Utterly (expletive) ridiculous that our state had its votes stolen and given to that war criminal. If they had a statewide recount, one that included our county, we wouldn’t have ever gone to war with (expletive) Iraq.”
				</p>

				<p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify;">
					Even Charles Jones, an outspoken Bush supporter who voted for the president twice and voted for McCain in the most recent election, agrees. “I’ll never apologize about loving my country and loving my president, but they went about it the wrong way there. I think a statewide manual recount would’ve still confirmed the president, but only focusing on a few counties, leaving out Albuquerque… was definitely slimy.”
				</p>

				<p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify;">
					Walter J. White, a political science professor at the University of New Mexico recently profiled in this paper for his similar name to <em>Breaking Bad’s</em> protagonist, has his own thoughts on the election. “Previous times in American history when elections have hinged on one state, or maybe a few, such as 1884 or 1960, it tended to be a large electoral prize that makes or breaks an election. It speaks a lot to the unique dynamics of 2000, just how close that election was in so many states, that New Mexico was the tipping point. It would take either a vast amount of circumstance, or an incredibly polarized electorate along very close lines, for something like that to occur again.”
				</p>

				<p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify;">
					Mr. White’s wife, Jesse (also previously noted for the amusing name similarity to <em>Breaking Bad’s</em> deuteragonist), a chemistry professor at UNM, has her own thoughts on the matter. “It’s hard to really emphasize just how transformational this was for the city. Before this, we were just a run-of-the-mill, fast-growing town in the sunbelt, but this put us on the map. I remember, we had to move out of the house for some repairs for a week at the time, and we wound up in the same hotel that James Baker was at. Next thing you know, we got the Isotopes the next year, and now we have more people moving here than Phoenix.”
				</p>

				<p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify;">
					“The thing that I think nobody ever talks about,” says Mr. White, “Bush had a questionable lead in Florida that has basically been forgotten. 478 votes, I think, or something close. From what I’ve talked about with my colleagues in Gainesville, if Gore had gotten a manual recount there, he likely would have won the state, and taken the electoral college by a fair margin.”
				</p>

				<p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify;">
					Every person interviewed for this piece spoke at length about the positive impact that <em>Breaking Bad</em> has had on their city. “Breaking Bad has done an awful lot in turning our image around,” says Crawford. “People used to think we were just a desert wasteland with meth and poor people. The show has reinforced that, but it’s all tongue in cheek, and it’s made people really take a second look at us, start wanted to host conferences here and those sorts of things.”
				</p>

				<p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify;">
					Jones concurs. “When Saul Goodman says, ‘Yeah, I stole that election for Bush,’ the thought isn’t that New Mexico is some crazy state like it was in 2000, but that Saul is a charming guy who may or may not be serious about what he’s saying. Either way, he’s part of something that really brings the area to life. I like to ride up to Sandia Peak once a month. I’ve been doing this for 27 years, and the amount of tourists I’ve seen since the show started a few years back has been immense.”
				</p>

				<p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify;">
					When reached for comment, <em>Breaking Bad</em> creator Vince Gilligan issued a brief clarification that Saul Goodman’s involvement with the Bush campaign was restricted to a brief one-liner and that it would make no impact on the plot, although he did mention that it was possible other characters would mention the recount in the show going forward, echoing the season two, episode ten episode “Over,” where Walter gets into an argument with his brother-in-law Hank over the election’s validity, after Hank takes an unambiguously pro-Bush stance.
				</p>

				<p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-size: 17px; text-align: justify;">
					“Saul is someone who you’re not really supposed to know the background of, and there aren’t any plans to divulge that. I think Bob (Odenkirk) has done an incredible job of making Saul the kind of character who will tell Jesse that he stole the election for Bush, and then tell Walt that he was a lawyer for the Gore campaign, and you just don’t know what’s true.” In the meantime, the viral trend of posting Saul Goodman shows no signs of stopping, and <em>Breaking Bad</em> fans will have to wait until Sunday, when the next episode “Fly” releases, for Walter–and Saul’s– story to continue.

              <p>
              Ronald Reagan’s return to the White House was unprecedented, dashing, symbolic of a man whose entire political career had been about breaking paradigms. Sure, it wasn’t Ronald Reagan, the President–that was still Bush, ever the loyal, boring lackey–but it was Ronald Reagan, the newly minted Secretary of the Interior, back in the swing of big time politics with the task of overseeing the land of the country that he loved so much and had hurt so badly. At the Cabinet meeting in the early days of 1993, when he spoke, people listened.
              </p>
              <p>
              Now, the Reagan of 1993 wasn’t the Reagan of 1981, who had fearlessly marshalled the entire federal government to reconsider its primary purpose of existence, but he was at least fairly similar with the Ronald Reagan of 1992, who had stepped in for an incapacitated Bush as the de facto Republican nominee for president and had done a damn fine job. Sure, there had been a few occasional miscues while campaigning, but in the end, he had sent Jerry Brown packing, back to the hippie streets of San Francisco, just as he had sent the man’s father packing so many years ago. 1993 Reagan, who many whispered seemed to face the public almost more than the actual president, was still the type of guy who you could trust to be the face of a party, of a movement.
              </p>
              <p>
              Over the course of the year, though, it was impossible to not notice that the Reagan who had been sworn in as Secretary of the Interior in January wasn’t the same man roaming the streets of Washington in December. He was forgetful, even more so than he’d been previously. Names, faces, some of them had seemingly gone completely blank. He had always been a pure figurehead for the department, as everyone was aware and okay with the arrangement, but his limited administrative duties slowed to a trickle. An average day was Reagan entering the office, sitting at his desk and blankly gazing at papers, and then kicking his feet up on the chair while popping jelly beans until the cows came home. Rinse, repeat. The only thing that seemed to ignite him was when he travelled to various National Parks and historic locations, where the new experiences and the sun on his face seemed to revive the man his companions had once known before crashing down to Earth when he got back to Washington.
              </p>
              <p>
              January 1994 would prove to be when things really came to a head. Locked into a fierce, losing battle with Congress, facing annihilation in the midterms, George Bush strode into the Capitol determined to turn his presidency around, to make something out of his second term before it all washed away into a sea of gridlock and insolvency. Ronald Reagan, meanwhile, stayed at home, having drawn the short stray of the designated survivor for the address. Bundled up in a bunker 50 miles away from Washington, 300 meters below the surface, the only thing he had to comfort himself was his TV, on which he watched reruns of Family Ties. It was good entertainment.
              </p>
              <p>
              Unbeknownst to Bush, unbeknownst to Reagan, somehow unbeknownst to America’s sprawling national security apparatus, a nasty surprise awaited the State of the Union that night. Beneath the floor was a massive bomb, planted there by anti-government militiamen with just the right combination of stupidity, fanaticism, and dumb luck to orchestrate such a bombing. Wrong by the events in Waco and Ruby Ridge, they lashed out, and did so in the deadliest, most dramatic form possible, unleashing an explosion of fury that wiped everyone in attendance at the State of the Union from the face of the Earth. No one was spared, save for Arkansas Senator Dale Bumpers, who had been overcome by illness during the speech and had walked to the other end of the Capitol in search of a peaceful bathroom.
              </p>
              <p>
              When the Secret Service men came running to the bunker, nuclear football in hand, Reagan was in the middle of watching a scene of Michael J. Fox’s young Republican schooling his ex-hippie parents on basic economics, causing Reagan to nearly double over laughing. As such, it was an unwelcome surprise when the TV screen suddenly switched to footage of the Capitol burning. He tried changing the channel, but it was no use; it was the same story everywhere. Dejected, he sat back and wondered how long he had to sit there until he could see Nancy again.
              </p>
              <p>
              At that moment, the Secret Service burst into the room, marshalling Secretary–no, President–Reagan into action.
              </p>
              <p>
              “Mr. Reagan, sir. There has been an attack on the United States government. Due to the chain of command, you are now President of the United States.”
              </p>
              <p>
              Reagan sat there, looking shocked. He blinked once, then twice. It didn’t make any sense. Where was Michael J. Fox?
              </p>
              <p>
              “Uh, okay,” he said. It seemed like the nice men might want to hear something like that. “That sounds interesting.”
              </p>
              <p>
              “Mr. Reagan, President Reagan, sir. We need to get you into a position where you can address the American people.”
              </p>
              <p>
              This was all too much. It was too hard. He tried to focus for a moment, but it was cold and dark in the bunker, just like those 1920s winters in Dixon. There was something there, something important that he needed to grasp on, and he tried. He tried, he tried, but he just couldn’t quite hold onto it, and it slipped away. It was cold.
              </p>
              <p>
              Ronald Wilson Reagan, 40th and 42nd President of the United States of America, looked back at the serious men in the suits holding guns, eyes blank as a sheet of ice. Finally, he mustered the courage to ask the most important question:
              </p>
              <p>
              “Who’s Reagan?”

                  <h2>Whatever Happened to Ronald Reagan?</h2>

                  <h4>The Atlantic</h4>
                  <h4>Max Boot</h4>

                  <p>
                  Tulsi-Gabbard’s right-wing worldview has a lot of critics, many of them Republicans in her own party, who argue that Ronald Reagan would “roll over” or “turn over” in his grave if he could see what is happening to his old party. Since the Gipper’s retreat from the national scene in the mid-1990s, the GOP has had mixed electoral success, but has widely been characterized as being ideologically rudderless beyond basic conservative principles–until now. The Gabbard-dominated, nationalist-corporatist GOP is certainly very different from the conservative party that Reagan led in the 1980s, and Gabbard is a very different figure, in both outlook and personality, from Reagan. But it’s also true that, however much Gabbard has changed the Republican Party since 2020 (and the changes have been enormous), the roots of Gabbardism can be traced back to Reagan’s last act, when public perceptions of the president shifted dramatically and, in the eyes of many observers, permanently damaged his political legacy. Uncomfortable as it is for many Gabbard fans to admit, the 40th president inadvertently prepared the ground for the 46th in multiple ways, just not in the ways that he intended. These similarities are a reminder that Gabbard did not emerge from nowhere, and that ridding the Republican Party of her influence won’t be easy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  The differences between Gabbard and Reagan are, to be sure, substantial. Most obviously, Gabbard champions contemporary ideas of equality that Reagan, a traditionalist who constantly focused on America needing to return to core religious values, would find sacrilegious. The idea of a moderately religious Hindu dictating American social policy is diametrically opposed to everything that Reagan fought for.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Reagan was pro–free trade and anti-spending, rejecting the protectionism and anti-austerity that have been Gabbard’s hallmarks. He launched his 1980 campaign with a speech that included a proposal for a “North American Accord” to allow “peoples and commerce” to “flow more freely” across the borders between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. This idea eventually blossomed into the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Gabbard called the “dumbest idea ever.” As president, Reagan cut taxes by dramatic margins, leading to an economic boom, while Gabbard has limited herself to fairly limited, targeted tax cuts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Although Reagan, like Gabbard, did not see combat, he, unlike Gabbard, venerated U.S. diplomatic efforts and staunchly supported U.S. alliances such as NATO. Reagan would never have denounced the military as “a regrettable endeavor that I was sucked into,” denigrated Medal of Honor recipients, or told the Russians that they can do “as much as they’re able to” to U.S. allies who don’t pay more for their defense. So, too, is it inconceivable that Reagan would have raised any concerns about supporting the occupied people of the Baltic States. As president, Reagan backed anti-Communist insurgents from Afghanistan to Nicaragua. Gabbard has steadfastly resisted calls to aid the freedom fighters of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  The stylistic differences between Reagan and Gabbard may be even more notable than the policy differences. Gabbard is a hardcore partisan who maligns his critics in harsh terms. Reagan, by contrast, was a consummate gentleman who seldom had a harsh word for anyone. Though he was at the fringes of his party, he always practiced respect for his opponents. A product of the early-20th-century, small-town Midwest, Reagan, even in the privacy of his own diary, never spelled out hell and damn (instead writing “h---l” and “d---n”). Reagan revered America as a “shining city on a hill” and ran for reelection in 1984 claiming it was “Morning in America.” Reagan would never say, as Gabbard just did, that “the American dream is dead” and that “our country is in a death spiral.” Reagan inspired hope, whereas Gabbard spreads fear.

                  Despite their many differences, however, the only two presidents to have been divorced also share some significant similarities. Reagan was a populist who reviled the government he led, even if he did not call it the “deep state,” and belittled expertise. He often quipped, “I’ve always felt the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I’m from the Government, and I’m here to help.” Gabbard sees that government as needing fundamental change instead of shrinkage, but Reagan’s ideas intensified the anti-government mood that Gabbard has exploited in recent years. Reagan’s policies, tilted toward the wealthy, exacerbated income inequality, thus also contributing to the backlash that Gabbard now harnesses.

                  <p>
                  So, too, did Reagan’s campaign rhetoric sometimes contain the extremism espoused today by Gabbard. Early in his political career, Reagan regularly accused Democrats of plotting to turn America into a socialist and even communist country with their welfare programs. In his famous 1964 “Time for Choosing” speech, Reagan accused Democrats of “taking the party of Jefferson, Jackson, and Cleveland down the road under the banners of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin.” Reagan later moderated his rhetoric; Gabbard never has.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  With these similarities, then, is it possible to imagine a scenario where Gabbardism eventually goes the way of Reaganism? Although current generations might not know it, Reagan was, at one point, the most highly respected politician in the country. Beyond his landslide victories in 1980 and 1984, it was on the strength of his continued popularity that George Bush was able to win a second term in 1992, with Reagan serving as the de facto candidate for much of the campaign due to Bush suffering a horrific injury. However, people today best remember Reagan for his fading mental state in the second Bush administration, a problem that was intensified by Bush’s insistence on keeping Reagan on as an official advisor making public addresses, even after it was clear that Reagan had Alzheimer’s. Not only did Reagan’s mental state damage his reputation (his approval rating today sits at a mere 44%, well under the 63% he exited his presidency with), but it also damaged his and Bush’s political project. The reductions in government size and regulations that occurred under Reagan’s presidency were thought to be indefinite during the 16 years he and Bush were in office and endorsed to some extent by many Democratic challengers (especially 1992 Democratic candidate Jerry Brown), but the succeeding Schwarzkopf administration would prove to expand the size of the government, increase its regulatory power, and raise taxes and spending, changes that future administrations would continue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  However, until now, Reagan’s power has remained crystalized in the GOP mindset. As the last successful Republican administration, with the ruinous second half of Bush’s presidency (to say nothing of Reagan’s own association with it, as previously mentioned) and the somehow even worse single term of Giuliani, before Gabbard, Reagan was the only Republican whose ideas were able to galvanize the entire party and lead to an entire presidency that could at least somewhat be characterized as successful in its goals. In this sense, he held the odd dual position of the broader public having some level of disdain for him even as the Republican party was forced to cling to him out of necessity, with each successive presidential challenger hoping to seize the crown of a new Reagan and recreate his legacy without the mental decline which is synonymous with his name. Now, with Gabbard’s magnetic hold over her party and the possibility of her cementing her place in the American presidential canon by winning a second term this November, she has the chance to completely cast off Ronald Reagan’s legacy for good and create a new Republican party focused on Gabbardism, one where Gabbard’s proposals for an alliance with Russia are a norm instead of a shocking concession.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  We should not exaggerate the similarities between Reagan and Gabbard. If Reagan were alive today, he undoubtedly would be criticized by Gabbard supporters as a RINO (“Republican in name only”). But Reagan, like other Republican politicians of earlier eras, helped set the GOP—and the country—on the path that led it to embrace Gabbard. The question for the Republican Party now is: What comes next? Will the party continue moving ever further to the right, toward a Viktor Orbán–style authoritarian movement that would presumably have Reagan (an avid believer in democracy) doing more spinning in his grave? Or will it revert to being a more center-right party in the Reagan mold? In the 1980s, “Reaganism” represented a right turn for the GOP. Today it would represent a much more complex turn to the left and right at the same time—still overall a restoration of a more moderate, if still conservative, outlook. That may still happen. But only if Gabbard loses decisively in November—and even then, it won’t be easy.

						Jerry Brown Washington National Airport is one of two major airports serving Washington D.C. In 2003, a hostile and partisan Democratic Congress passed a bill renaming it after former president Jerry Brown as part of the larger efforts to create a cult around him, which weak-willed RINO Bill Weld signed into law. Unlike Dulles Airport, which receives international flights, Brown does not have an immigration center and only receives flights from an approved list of airports, making it a perfect hotspot for human and child trafficking.
					</p>

					<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
						Notably, the airport’s logo resembles a hate symbol, with the UK Counter Terrorism Policing agency listing it next to the swastika as "symbols commonly associated with white supremacy" since Neo-Nazis have used the symbol. It is largely believed that airport staff, who are overwhelmingly urban Democrats, are in cahoots with the human trafficking rings that operate in it, with one expose by Sovereign Patriot News revealing that traffickers had a “prayer to Jerry Brown to commemorate making it through the airport.”
					</p>

					<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
						Unlike Dulles, Brown advances the Soros-backed homosexual agenda with gay pride parades, changing their hate-symbol logo every June to include rainbow colors. Also in contrast with Dulles, Brown’s governance is overseen by a special leadership council which is liberal and under the influence of western globalists who seek to control air travel.
					</p>

					<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
						Multiple surveys of America’s airports have described Brown as one of the worst airports in the country, with Breitbart News calling it “an abysmal, inefficient eyesore in the capital” and the Prepper Times calling it “the worst place on the planet to get a connection.” Although many biased organizations such as CNN and MSNBC rank it highly, this is likely a liberal psy-op seeking to continue the cult of associating Jerry Brown’s name with good things.
					</p>

					<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
						Jerry Brown himself is said to be fond of the airport, although he expressed surprise at it being renamed after him, stating “I’m very honored, but also very shocked that anyone thought highly enough of me to christen a whole airport in my name, while I’m still alive. From now on, every time I fly there, it’s going to feel odd.” In this extremely rare case, Brown was correct about something.

                  <p>Jerry Brown: Hey, uh, Dad, this is Jerry calling. Are you there?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Pat Brown: I’m here, I’m here. How are you?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry: You know, I’m feeling pretty good. Really good, actually. I got my cup of coffee, I’m watching the sun come up over San Francisco Bay. Life is good.
                  </p>
                  Pat: I watched the results on TV last night. Congratulations, son. I’m so happy for you.
                  <p>
                  Jerry: Thanks, dad, I really appreciate it. You, uh, it feels almost like I’ve avenged you, in a way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Pat: What do you mean, you avenged me?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry: I just mean back 26 years ago, when you lost to Ronald Reagan. The actor, the far-right loon. Well, I beat him. It was Bush’s name on the ticket, but I beat Reagan, I really did.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Pat: Yeah. You did, huh?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry: Reagan, I worked with him, and I personally thought that he wasn’t too bad, on a human level, but the impacts of what he did were pretty evil. He had to go.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Pat: You’re right, he did have to go. But you have to bury him, you understand me?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry: I think that I maybe understand you? Define “bury” for me.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Pat: You remember ‘62, against Nixon? Kathy was so terrified that I lost that she cried herself to sleep, but just like you, I won against all odds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry: Yeah, I remember that one well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Pat: You remember Nixon’s last press conference? His last, ever. Said that we wouldn’t have Nixon to kick around anymore.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry: Yeah, I remem–oh. I get it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Pat: That’s what I mean. Hatred is like a… oh, it’s like a chimera. You can cut it down as many times as you like, but you can’t kill it without extreme measures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry: You think that’s what Reagan is? Hatred?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Pat: I know it. I tried to play nice with Reagan, when he became elected president, said some things that people wanted to hear, but let me be honest with you: I have no respect for that man. Never have, never will. Successful, but vapid and evil. I mean, so was Hitler, so was Stalin.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry: So how do you defeat hatred? I mean, I have my own ideas, but what do you think we need to do to beat hate?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Pat: You have to prove it’s worthless to the people. But the people, they’re only going to believe you if you give it to them concretely. You gotta put an extra $20 in their pocket. You gotta make their commute to work 15 minutes shorter. Otherwise, they give in.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry: That makes a lot of sense. So you think that I’ve got to do that now that I’m the, I’m the President?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Pat: Yes, that’s what you’ll have to do. But you need to act fast. In our democracies, it takes five years to build something and a month to destroy it. I spent eight years in Sacramento, and I’m proud of what I did, but there’s a lot of that which Reagan turned around. Same goes on the national scale.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry: I remember that, yeah. I didn’t think it was all bad, but I do think it’s fair to say that there was a lot that he tore up for no reason other than that GE wanted him to tear it up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Pat: That’s right, and it’s going to be even harder than that. The moment you take your hand off that bible and make your solemn vow, the vultures are going to be on you.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry: That’s pretty horrible. I think that when I was in Sacramento, it wasn’t so bad, but–
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Pat: I’m going to lay it out for you. The nation isn’t California, son. It’s not as developed, it’s not as free-thinking. You have a few years, tops, before you’re going to get stymied. JFK had two. LBJ had three. Carter had none. Even a great man like FDR, he had only five or six years before Russell and Taft reared their heads. The clock is ticking.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry: I see. But maybe I don’t want to expand the government. Maybe I just want to change it, make it better. Make our country better. We don’t always need a regulatory board to do that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Pat: You know, Jerry, we’ve always had this disagreement. I get it. But I’m telling you, as a man who was once entrusted with great power, as your… as your father, there are millions of people out there whose lives could be better. We can turn the other cheek, or we can give them a hand up. And I’m not saying that every bum needs some spare change. But some of them do, because they won’t get it otherwise.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry: That’s uh… wow. I agree with you. I’ll have to think about it. You make some good points, dad. You do.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Pat: I’m glad you’re acknowledging that. You know, you were always more your mother’s kid. I got Kathy, your mother got you. Emotionally, at least.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry: Oh, thanks for reminding me. I’ll call Kathy later, Barbara and Cynthia too. Is mom up right now?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Pat: She’s up, but one of her friends has a daughter who’s just getting into golf, so she’s over at the links giving the girl some tips. She should be back in a few hours.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry: That’s great; I’l make sure to call her then. I, uh, is there anything else we should talk about, before I hang up? From here on out, my schedule is going to be, I mean, just absurdly busy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Pat: You know, you never needed me, as governor. Kathy had me swear her in as treasurer, but you never called.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry: I’m sorry, dad.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Pat: No, don’t be sorry. You remember when I called Kathy the real politician in the family?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry: That was my 50th birthday party. Of course I remember. You said that in front of everyone.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Pat: I never got the chance to explain, but… but… that’s not a bad thing. She’s a politician, just like her old man. Jerry, you’ve run for office more than most people have, and you’re the president–God, you’re the president–now, but you’ve never been a politician. You’re too serious of a man to be one.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry: I think that the cat’s out of the bag at this point. I don’t know if you can be a governor and a president without being a politician.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Pat: It’s not what your job title is, but who you are. Kathy calls me asking for advice on how to talk to donors; you call me asking if I can donate to Mother Teresa. And I’ll admit, I had my doubts–
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry: –Yeah, I know the doubts–
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Pat: But despite all that, you won. You’re on top now. So go out there and be the man you’ve always been. And yes, I’m giving you advice and will continue to give advice, some of it very important, but you’re enough of your own man to decide whether you want to listen. Kathy would just nod and do exactly as I say. She’s a good politician who’s also a good woman. You’re a good man who’s also a good politician.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry: …Uh…
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Pat: Are you still there?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry: I’m still here, I’m still here. Sorry, the sun’s just really hitting the bay waters now. It’s a good vista from up here.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Pat: Well, I won’t hold you too long. You’re going to have to start making some big decisions starting very soon. So good luck. We can always talk later.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry: Yeah, it’s going to be a busy day. We should get lunch sometime this week, though. I’ll make time to come to Pasadena.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Pat: That would be lovely. When Bernice comes back, I’ll tell her. Maybe you two can hammer out the details when you call her.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Jerry: We’ll figure it out. Okay, bye, dad.

                  <h3>ROLLING STONE- Feb 2017</h3>
                  <h4>Cobain at 50</h4>

                  <p>Kurt Cobain, better known as the supposed voice of Generation X, has lived a much different life since the disbandment of Nirvana in 1994 after tensions due to Cobain’s drug use and backing out from headlining Lollapalooza that very same year. Ever since, he has remained focused on his own solo career shortly, alongside his side pursuit of painting, with his first public exhibition showing in 2001 and his most recent exhibition wrapping up in 2016. At 50, how does one of the single most famous men in the world stack up compared to the image that the public has spent over 25 years constructing?</p>

                  <p>Cobain shows us around his Seattle home, where there’s an assortment of finished and unfinished paintings, a few guitars, his large collection of records, and other trinkets, before sitting down for an interview over a pot of black coffee.</p>

                  <p>There’s been a lot of talk about a potential new Nirvana album after Krist Novoselic publicly talked about reopening communication with you and Dave. Do you have any regrets about the band’s original run?</p>
                  <p>“It was too much, too fast. While I’ve kind of grown used to the fame and had a lot of time to really bask in what it feels like, none of us knew what we were getting into then. We were in our early to mid twenties, and after Nevermind, it never seemed like what we were doing was enough to really satisfy the public. So, naturally, we began trying to one-up our Nirvananess, trying to come up with a purer version of what made us special. Once touring began for In Utero, I realized that it wasn’t self-sustainable. It was killing me.”</p>

                  <p>In Utero was Nirvana's last album. With the twenty-fifth anniversary next year, do you have any special memories while recording it? Do you think the album holds up?</p>
                  <p>“Absolutely. We wanted In Utero to be the exact opposite of Nevermind. We spent two weeks recording in the middle of nowhere in Minnesota during the winter, and it was great. I remember us prank calling Gene Simmons, and Dave throwing his cymbals to get the icicles off the building. Until DGC executives heard the album, it was as personal of a recording experience as I’ve ever had. I don’t regret a thing though. I honestly think, speaking as the biased man who played guitar and sang on the album, that it holds, in a way that I sometimes think that Bleach and Nevermind don’t hold. For the 25th anniversary next year, I’ve been talking with some of our engineers for that album, as well as Krist and Dave, and we definitely want to release some of the original mixes to the public. Hopefully, people can wait a year.</p>

                  <p>Is there a moment in particular that really changed your perception, especially during those early years? You went from recording and touring all of the time to slowing down dramatically, and you’ve spoken in depth about how much you feel that your perception of the world changed in the leadup to the breakup.</p>
                  <p>It was really a whole year. 1992 was the most life-changing year I think I had… It was when everything reached its peak with Nevermind, and when I was becoming a father. It was scary! I didn’t know what to do. I had just turned 25, and here I am playing a benefit show with the next President of the United States. It fucks with your head. I entered that year a much, much different man than I left it. It was just a decade of growth packed into a year.”</p>

                  <p>That concert, No On #9, has been very extensively covered since the fact. What were your emotions about it at the time?</p>
                  <p>The #9 ballot issue was something that really resonated with me, just that people could have such hate in their hearts. When I saw there was a chance to take a stand against it, I took it. But all of a sudden, there’s a bunch of security everywhere backstage, and suddenly, there I was with Brown. I liked him, and I even donated to him during the primaries that year, but I hadn’t expected him to be there, so it was a stunner. I was shell shocked during the concert. I wouldn’t describe myself as Democrat or Republican, because I think there’s major issues with both parties, but when he ran, he made me believe there was an actual chance for someone with a conscience to be leader. We haven’t had anyone as good in the White House since him, I’ll say that.</p>

                  <p>When you spoke out in favor of gay rights, it was decidedly unpopular. Now, we’ve reached the half-decade mark of nationwide gay marriage. How does it feel to be ahead of the curve?</p>
                  <p>I guess it feels good, but truth be told, I’m not really the sort to feel extremely vindicated over something like that. I’m proud that I’ve been able to stand for what was right before that was the popular thing to do, but I don’t belittle others for taking the time to come around on it. It’s hard to do. Going off of that, though, seeing the progress we’ve made just absolutely warms my heart. As broken as our politics can be, I think we’ve made huge strides in making this country a place where everyone can be who they want to be and love who they want to love. I couldn’t imagine that in 1992.</p>

                  <p>Last but not least, I’m sure you’ve heard the rumors. It’s public knowledge that you, Krist, and Dave have been talking again. Could Nirvana ever see a reunion?</p>
                  <p>I think that there’s a narrative that Krist and Dave and I are on bad terms, but that’s not the case. Nirvana had run its course, but, I mean, our relationships as humans are still there. I’ve seen both guys dozens of times since the band broke up. But these rumors are just that–rumors. All Krist really meant, in that report that everyone got excited over, was that the three of us had a groupchat.</p>

                  <p>But could Nirvana ever see a reunion?</p>
                  <p>
                  Never say never, but it would require all three guys having the right amount of passion. I suspect that an ungodly large sum of money would be involved.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  So, probably not?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  It’s unlikely, but don’t count it out forever. I’ll just say that.
                  </p>

                  <h2>Buchanan Voters and Midwestern Whites</h1>
                  <h4>Robert K. Morgan, Hyeon Kyung</h4>
                  <h3>University of California Santa Cruz</h3>
                  <h4>Journal of Political Science</h4>

                  <p>
                  Abstract:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  To evaluate the claim that white voters were a crucial block of support for Pat Buchanan in the 1996 presidential election, this article offers two sets of results. First, self-reports of presidential votes in 1992 and 1996 from the American National Election Studies show that Brown-to-Buchanan voters and 1992 eligible nonvoters composed a substantial share of Buchanan’s 1996 voters and were disproportionately likely to be white individuals from the geographic Midwest. Second, when county vote tallies in 1992 and 1996 are merged with the public-use microdata samples of the 1992-to-1996 American Community Surveys, areal variations across 1,142 geographic units that sensibly partition the United States show that Buchanan’s gains in 1996 above Bush’s performance in 1992 are strongly related to the proportion of the voting population that was white, but disproportionately situated in geographical units in the Midwest. Taken together, these results support the claim that Buchanan’s appeal to Midwestern whites was crucial for his surprising overperformance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  HOW was Pat Buchanan able to bring the 1996 election down to the margins after routinely trailing in polling throughout the campaign season? A leading explanation is that he appealed directly to white voters in the Midwest, fusing trade protectionism with anti-immigrant rhetoric and calls for traditionalist values to guide policymaking as part of his America First! Agenda. Interestingly, Buchanan’s gains with white Midwesterners were not replicated in other areas of the country, with Buchanan losing white support in the West and Northeast while holding steady in the South. Building directly on Morgan and Kygung (1997) and related, recent research (e.g., Hahn, Suzuki, and Peretti 1998; Simpson, Park, and Gomez 1998; Kozinski 1997), in this article, we evaluate two straightforward questions at the core of this white Midwestern narrative:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  1. Were Midwestern Brown voters in 1992 a substantial portion of Buchanan’s voters in 1996, and if so, were they disproportionately white?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  2. Were Midwestern eligible nonvoters in 1992 a substantial portion of Buchanan’s voters 1996, and if so, were they disproportionately white?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Although simple in structure, these two questions are difficult to answer because of the measurement limitations of available data sources. Individual votes are private, and as a result, individual-level data must be elicited in after-election polls and surveys, which are subject to both recall error and social desirability bias. In addition, at present, the American National Election Studies (ANES) 1996 Times Series Study is the only available national survey that has elicited self-reports of 1992 and 1996 general election votes for president and has a direct measure of a respondent’s current or last occupation that can be plausibly coded as working class or not. And, although we will analyze this invaluable data source in this article, the ANES is nonetheless limited in size, preventing an informative spatial analysis of the distribution of the types of Buchanan voters across the states that he carried or improved his margins in, including the three states that he flipped. An alternative but complementary approach to these questions is to develop an areal analysis of actual recorded votes across geographic units, comparing the 1996 vote distribution to the 1992 vote distribution. With this approach, other analysts have already considered how shifts in county-level vote totals from 1992 to 1996 can be related to county-level demographic estimates provided by the U.S. Census Bureau (the most widely read being those produced by data journalists in the weeks following the election; e.g., Goldman 1996b). Unfortunately, the county-level tables published by the U.S. Census Bureau do not offer breakdowns of occupation that map onto any reasonable definition of the working class and that apply only to the electorate rather than the full adult population of each county. A more powerful approach is to develop direct measures of the white working class using U.S. census microdata, with samples restricted as best one can to the eligible voting population, and then relate these measures to aggregated vote tallies in a sensible fashion. We offer this type of analysis in this article, considering variation across 1,142 geographic units that partition the United States. We cannot overcome the most substantial weakness of an areal analysis: we cannot link 1992 votes directly to 1996 votes nor to turnout decisions, and thus we cannot separate 1996 Buchanan voters into Brown-to-Buchanan voters, Bush-to-Buchanan voters, 1992 nonvoters, and other types of voters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Nonetheless, with these two types of analysis, we are able to evaluate the plausibility of the core empirical claims of the white working-class narrative for Buchanan’s performance. Neither set of results fully resolves the limitations of the other, but we aim to show that this is a case in which the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Based on our findings, there is significant evidence to suggest that Buchanan’s gains were almost entirely limited to white Midwestern voters, seemingly equalized across all age and income brackets. As such, there is reason to think that this performance was a direct result of Buchanan’s messaging and appeals to these white voters and that this strategy was electorally efficient, flipping three Midwestern states while shortening the margins in every other Midwestern state that Brown won. More research is needed to determine the existence of causation between Buchanan’s rhetoric and his electoral gains.

                  <h2>Buchanan Ends Presidential Campaign After Underwhelming Super Tuesday Performance</h2>
                  <h4>March 6, 1996</h4>
                  <h4>Casper Star-Tribune</h4>
                  <h4>Brian Moore</h4>

                  <p>Pat Buchanan, a conservative commentator and former vice-presidential nominee, has announced that he is suspending his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. This decision comes after a series of primary losses and increasing pressure from party leaders to unify behind Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Buchanan's campaign, which had long led polling for the Republican nomination prior to the official beginning of the primaries, struggled to maintain momentum once the primaries actually got underway. His platform, characterized by a hardline stance on immigration and a broad call for a return to traditional values, was immensely popular with part of the Republican base but widely alienated most moderates in the party.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Despite enjoying a polling and name recognition lead for much of the runup to the primaries, Sen. Dole consistently outraised Buchanan, and many on the ground in the early primary states credited him with having much better organization. Dole bested Buchanan in Iowa by half a percentage point, but then scored a shocking victory in New Hampshire by over five points in a race that many had Buchanan pegged to win by 15 points, reshaping the fundamentals of the race. From there, Buchanan saw his campaign falter, with an eleven-point loss in the Arizona primary setting him up for doom on Super Tuesday.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Ultimately, Dole would sweep Super Tuesday entirely, winning all nine primaries in landslides and making Buchanan's path forward to the nomination appear untenable. Addressing supporters in Colorado, Dole declared that “victory will shortly be at hand.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  In a statement released this morning, Buchanan expressed pride in the movement his campaign had sparked but acknowledged the challenges ahead, officially withdrawing from the race. "While our message has found a passionate audience, the path to the nomination has narrowed," he said. "I believe it is in the best interest of our party and our country to suspend my campaign and support the nominee."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  With Buchanan gone from the race, Dole, who has no other notable challengers remaining, is now the presumptive nominee. Party leaders hope that Buchanan’s endorsement of Dole will increase Republican unity and will strengthen their position against President Jerry Brown in the upcoming general election, in a contest where any hypothetical Republican nominee trails Brown by over ten points in the national polling average. Though Dole can take solace in having de facto clinched the Republican nomination, he faces an uphill battle for the presidency.

                  <h4>A collection of quotes from Senator David Duke’s (R-LA) Senate colleagues after his untimely death in a plane crash in 2019</h4>

                  <p>“He was a close friend of mine and one of the few confidants I always knew I could trust when everything was on the line. He was a friend to most, almost everyone, in this body.”<br>
                  -Senate Majority Leader John Cornyn, R-TX</p>

                  <p>“David was a public servant in the truest sense possible, a man who was always willing to do what was right for his constituents and bring the views of Louisiana to the Senate as accurately as possible. I know that I, for one, will miss him.”<br>
                  -Senator Susan Collins, R-ME</p>

                  <p>“The British essayist William Hazlitt once wrote, and I quote: ‘Death conceals everything but truth, and strips a man of everything but genius and virtue. It’s a sort of natural canonization.’ The truth and genius and virtue of David Duke is what I choose and we all choose to remember today.”<br>
                  -Senator Joe Biden, D-DE</p>

                  <p>“As a fellow Southerner, I have a great deal of respect for Senator Duke as a man of character, honor, and above all else, Southern pride. The world would be a much better place if we had more David Dukes and less Jesse Jacksons.”<br>
                  -Senator Roy Moore, R-AL</p>

                  <p>“No comment.”<br>
                  -Senator Cory Booker, D-NJ</p>

                  <p>“Senator Duke often got a bad rap, but when you actually look at him closely, he was much more moderate and reasonable than his opponents made him out to be. I consider knowing him to have been a worthy experience which made me a better woman, and I send my best regards to his family and the other victims of this terrible incident.”<br>
                  -Senator Lisa Murkowski, R-AK</p>

                  <p>“I worked very closely with Senator Duke for a number of years, and he was undoubtedly one of the hardest-working, most visionary members of Congress I’ve ever known. He’s the type of man that you wish had been president, and it’s a shame that he never ran for the office. Regardless, I’m going to miss him dearly.”<br>
                  -Senator Michele Bachmann, R-MN</p>

                  Presidential elections were held in the United States on November 3, 2016. Republican candidate and businessman Donald Trump and his running mate, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, were elected to a first term. They defeated the Democratic ticket of incumbent President Barack Obama and Vice President Mark Warner.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the incumbent President, Obama secured the Democratic nomination without serious opposition. The Republicans experienced an initially competitive primary, with Trump, who had lost to Obama in 2016, running again despite a number of legal charges against him hindering his campaign. Trump secured his party's nomination in May, defeating senator Jim DeMint, businessman Herman Cain, and Texas senator Ron Paul, among other candidates.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The campaigns focused heavily on domestic issues, and debate centered largely around sound responses to the inflation that had occurred during Obama’s term, the presence of policies meant to advance minority rights, and the American Healthcare Act. Foreign policy was also discussed, including the end of the Libyan War in 2017, military spending, and appropriate counteractions to counteract Chinese aggression in the Pacific. Trump claimed Obama's domestic policies were favored racial minorities over other individuals while Obama's campaign sought to characterize Trump as a plutocratic businessman who was out of touch with the average American.[4][5] The campaign was marked by a sharp rise in social media campaigning, both from the official campaigns and from other entities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Trump defeated Obama, winning 348 Electoral College votes and 51.9% of the popular vote to Obama’s 190 electoral votes and 46.2% of the popular vote.[6] He became the first president in 28 years (since Jerry Brown) unseat an incumbent and the first Republican since Orrin Hatch to win a majority of the popular vote. Reversing his results from 2016, Trump won every state considered to be Republican-leaning and swept the election’s “swing states” of Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Virginia, and North Carolina. Obama was unable to flip any states that Trump had previously won in 2016. As of 2025, this is the most recent presidential election in which the Democratic candidate won New Jersey, Oregon, and Maine.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Trump’s campaign was characterized by its far-right rhetoric and openly racial appeals to white voters, with many describing him as the first openly far-right politician to win the presidency.[7] His official campaign manager (and future Secretary of State) was Pat Buchanan, who had been the Republican vice-presidential nominee in 1992 and had failed in two other bids for the presidency in 2000 and 2012. Although Trump’s victory was not seen as an upset, the scale of it was, with most observers being surprised at Trump’s decisive margin in both the electoral college and the popular vote.

                  January 23rd, 1997
                  </h3>
                  <h3>

                  <p>WITH Jerry Brown settling into the first week of his second term, Americans across the political aisle are still reeling from the results of November 5th. Republicans' two-decade long effort to sway the Deep South away from Democratic clutches seem dashed, as President Brown won the Bible Belt by often considerable margins against Republican nominee Jack Kemp, only losing Mississippi and Alabama. It seems destined that 1996 will be analyzed and re-analyzed for decades to come, with its consensus as merely a political fluke or the beginning of a major party shift remaining to be seen. Still, it leaves many simply asking: what happened?</p>
                  <p>Several factors played into Brown’s victory: an incumbency boost, steady job growth under his administration, and a lackluster opponent with no clear message. However, among the most prominent of these components was Brown’s heavy appeal to the Deep South. Most Democratic presidents have required the South for some degree of victory (with minor exceptions), so it was no surprise in 1992 when Brown tapped Arkansas Senator David Pryor for VP. However, this election season went beyond balancing the ticket and making the occasional stump speech in New Orleans or Atlanta.</p>
                  <p>Throughout his first term, Brown appealed to the base that elected and re-elected his running mate in Arkansas for over 30 years by focusing on economics from a standpoint of pride, rather than income. Most prominently, he framed his gutting of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as a blatantly nativist victory. “We have to protect American workers,” he stated bluntly in his February 13th, 1993 press conference concerning NAFTA. “We should really be doing the opposite. Build up our workforce at home.” Although this rhetoric has also worked well in the North, you’d be hard pressed to find a city south of the Mason-Dixon Line unpolluted with campaign billboards, posters, flyers, and various advertisements championing Brown’s promotion of supposed American values. His nativist rhetoric on job security has ignited a base thought lost to the Democratic Party over a decade ago.</p>
                  <p>The deafening espousal of anti-free trade and worker’s rights is contrasted by his pin drop silence on racial matters. Repeatedly on the campaign trail, Brown ducked and dodged any conversation concerning race relations in the United States. When he was finally forced to give his opinion on affirmative action bans during a primetime interview, Brown fumbled a moment before finally murmuring out that “America should be a place of equal opportunity, regardless of skin color–no preferential treatment.” This behavior is a far cry from his 1992 primary ads lambasting Governor Bill Clinton on his racial track record, claiming that Clinton and a group of Georgia politicians looked “like colonial masters” while overseeing inmates in a state prison. This disassociation from racial issues is in lockstep with the new wave of Southern Democrats, their rhetoric commonly striking a balancing act between not being perceived as racist while maintaining the votes of an intolerant base.</p>
                  <p>Focusing sharply on his southern strategy, President Brown ran circles around Kemp in many states that were safely Republican just last election cycle. Despite Kemp’s record as a hardline conservative, especially financially, he could not shake off the positions imposed on him by Brown. During their presidential debates, the President repeatedly stated how Kemp’s plans would take away working class jobs, to which the Republican nominee could only muster stammering “uhms” while making vague remarks on the benefits of free trade. Not only was Brown on the offensive, but there was a decided lack of defense and definition from the Kemp campaign, which saw the Midwest–an area that they lost by even greater margins the the South–as its primary electoral objective..The few pit stops Kemp’s campaign made, in Alabama and South Carolina, did little to rile up support for the Republican ticket.</p>
                  <p>Notably, Brown and Kemp’s respective running mates also played a major factor in the race. Pryor, a born-and-raised Arkansan, was often put at the forefront of the Brown campaign, with many Southern advertisements portraying him as an equal to Brown, even teased as Brown’s successor. One advertisement which played extensively on Southern country and evangelical radio stations featured Brown and Pryor talking about their shared “old-school” values. In contrast, Kemp’s running mate, Indiana Senator Richard Lugar, filled in a ticket with no ties to the region, and during a televised interview, claimed that Southerners should “stop complaining” that the Republican ticket seemingly didn’t value their input.</p>
                  <p>The outcome of 1996 inevitably leads to questions about the new millennium and the 2000 election. Above them all, will the Democratic Party maintain this Southern appeasement? A revolt of hardline liberals already tried to buck Brown’s ideology with the “draft Bradley” movement in the primaries, but were quelled by a monsoon of moderates drowning the votes from the left, and Senator Bill Bradley’s refusal to run an independent campaign. 2000 could be different if a more progressive candidate wins the nomination or chooses to run on an independent ticket, almost certainly destroying the Southern coalition and giving the presidency to a Republican. It is impossible to say this far out.</p>
                  <p>With all that said, Brown is still settling into his first week back in the White House. Will he continue to appeal to Southern causes now that he no longer needs to worry about re-election? Or will he revert back to a more liberal platform, in keeping with his prior history as Governor of California? These questions remain to be answered. One thing is certain, at least for now: the Southern Democratic Party has found its footing again.</p>

Now, a recent uh, CNN AB- uh CNN  poll not ABC News- asked American citizens ‘Are you satisfied with President Brown’s first term in office?’ 53% said no, 42% said yes. Ooh, that’s gotta sting for the liberals. Uh, another question ‘Has the President shown responsibility during his first term?’ Look at that- 56% said no, 41% said yes. It’s clear from these numbers that not only uh, are people done with Brown and especially Bradley’s loony antics- heh- but our revolution is in full force to take back Washington in November, huh?

                  Thank you all for coming here. We will now move onto the next eulogy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  When I was a kid, during the 1970s, I realized one thing: I could not take anything for granted. Whether that be school supplies, friends, even that law enforcement could treat me consistently. There was huge pressure on us to succeed, to hustle, to get out of the hood. All of us wanted it. Most of us couldn't achieve it. None of us were deterred.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  I had also found myself partaking in this type of hustling lifestyle, so much so that I went on to record a few singles for a studio. That was in 1989, I believe. I was over the moon. It was every young black kid’s dream to land a deal of this sort and make it out of our impoverished neighborhoods.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  However, when the deal with the recording company fell through, I found myself staring down an insurmountable abyss. I thought I had lost my chance to do something, to be something. In the days following, I felt completely adrift, as if my one purpose on Earth, the very thing that I had been put on this planet to accomplish, had fallen through my hands like sand. It felt like the hood had swallowed me back up, right as I had managed to climb out of it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Needless to say, I myself was not too invested in politics or bureaucracy. It was all just a big scam to keep the little man down, I figured. It didn't properly represent me or my family. Over time, I managed to find a group who let me focus on my music career, but it felt cheap, unearned. I still lived in the hood, still ran with the same types of people I had grown up with. When 1992 rolled around, with Jerry Brown, his fiery outsider attitude failed to convince me when I first heard of him. What stopped him from simply turning his backs on us the moment he won? It wouldn’t have been anything new for politicians.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Then, he announced his running mate. Jesse Louis Jackson, leader of the Rainbow Coalition, and sworn enemy of White America of the time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  It was unreal. My mind was rushing. Could this have been the break that got us over the hump? Could those low-income neighborhood kids finally afford to dream?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  But at the same time, there was a great deal of fear involved. What would have happened had Brown lost? Would Jackson have been made into a scapegoat? Could that election have been the final nail in our coffin? Would black America even be allowed to dream of a president who looked like them?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  I sure wasn't about to let it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  I got organized. I started canvassing the next door folks, mailmen, newspaper sellers, any random passersby on the streets, handing out pins, banners, any miscellaneous merchandising that existed. Then, I started collecting signatures and informing people on where the nearest polling stations were. I finally felt like I was doing something to help the community.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  When November of that year strolled around, I had a huge smile on my face. Brown and Jackson had won in a landslide. There was a bizarre feeling in the air, a feeling of change, of redemption.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  But in the White House, it looked a bit tough at times. Brown did what he always did and moderated so that he could better represent the views of the people who had elected him. It was basic math: most of those people were white. Once he handily won 1996, running on a platform which was a lot less… radical than the first time around, people thought that the project was over. That the progressive revolution would be stopped after 8 years of Brown. That Jackson would never be president.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Now, in that time, I had tried focusing on a music career, had some success, but it was never fulfilling. So in 1998, I made my first bid for public office, and thanks to hard work and luck, I got elected as a representative to the California State House. When the 2000 election rolled around, I had the privilege of meeting, and shaking hands with Jesse Jackson in the flesh for the first time. I still remember it like yesterday. It was a cool August evening, and Jackson was doing a rally in my district, safe blue territory, after a… not-so-stellar DNC. And yet, despite all the political analysts leaving him for dead, predicting him to lose in a rout, Jackson was smiling. Laughing. Cheering. His optimism was contagious. After nervously approaching him, I asked him how he did it. And it was then that he gave me advice I would carry for the rest of my life: “No matter what you do, the first thing you have to do is give back to your community and help them whichever way you can. Other people are important, but before you move to helping them, don’t forget those who put you on the map to begin with. Do that, do it honestly, and you’ll never doubt yourself, not in the slightest.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  It was this attitude that drove him to a miraculous comeback. It was his trusty leadership that guided the country through the Pennsylvania terror bombings and gave him a second term. It was his strong presence in the White House that allowed a country’s worth of little black boys and little black girls to look at the most powerful man in the country and say “someday, this can be me.” Most importantly, it was his love for the people that ensures he will never be forgotten.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  The King had a dream. The Warrior made it a reality. And now, they can both rest. Thank you.

                  Outside, the Vice-President is all smiles. But inside, the Jackson campaign is spinning following Gore’s shocking upsets.
                  </p>

                  WHEN Vice-President Jackson finally exited his office to address the press following Al Gore’s shocking win in the Iowa primaries, he was all smiles. Sardonically, he shook his head, laughed and said, “At least it was better than my last run in Iowa.’’ In New Hampshire, it was a different story. He never left his office at all, with campaign manager Gerald Austin coming out and informing journalists that the VEEP had accepted his loss and was focused on March 7’s Super Tuesday primary.
                  </p>

                  Generally, when the President doesn’t run for re-nomination (or is term-limited) and his Vice-President does run, the Vice-President’s primary victory is a formality. Bush faced only token resistance in 1988, and although Walter Mondale’s 1984 victory was threatened by Colorado Senator Gary Hart, he ultimately triumphed over the insurgent off of the strength of his vice-presidential record. Further back, in 1960, Richard Nixon faced virtually no intraparty opposition when he ran for President. But now, it seems like the history-defining Jesse Jackson will continue to establish historical firsts–just not for the reasons he may have hoped. The first black Vice-President may find himself becoming the first Vice-President to lose his party’s presidential nomination since Thomas Marshall in 1920.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  The rebellion that Jackson is facing is unprecedented in the past 30 years, with many comparing Jackson’s struggles with the rightward flank of his party to the struggles Vice-President Humphrey had in 1968 with his leftward flank. While Vice-President Humphrey was able to beat his competitors to win the Democratic nomination, he would go on to lose to former Vice-President Nixon in the general election as his campaign struggled to unite a fractured party. With Dan Quayle's stunning upset in the GOP Iowa primaries, many are suspecting history is repeating itself. Unlike 1968, the primaries will almost certainly be decided before the convention, leading some to wonder if the Vice-President will survive this unexpectedly close race without the contested conventions that past vice-presidents enjoyed.

                  <p>
                  Senator Gore has been delighted with the outcomes. His relatively ramshackle operation had previously caused many to underestimate the Tennessean, but his moderate rebellion has been an astonishing success. At his victory rally in Nashua, he was overflowing with joy. ‘’Like all of you, I wish I wasn’t the one leading this charge. In particular, I wish Governor Casey were still with us, a titan of common sense governance. But just because he isn’t with us, doesn’t mean the principles he left us with–the principles that others have left us with and others work hard to uphold–have gone as well.’’ The Senator would go on to lambast the Vice-President’s ‘’out of the mainstream’’ social stances on reparations for slavery and gay rights, describing his campaign as a call to common sense.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  It’s not all good news for the Senator, however. While the upcoming Washington State primary is known for its friendliness to political outsiders, Delaware has historically been one of Jackson’s strongest states, with the state’s Democratic primary voters typically skewing black and liberal. Still, in the lead up to Super Tuesday, every state is up for grabs now that Gore has proven that his protest candidacy is very serious. Indeed, Jackson will face hostile territory in the Super Tuesday states, as a range of important endorsements appear to be going in Gore’s favor. Missouri Governor Mel Carnaharn endorsed Gore the day after the New Hampshire primary, as did California Governor Gray Davis. New York Senator Monynihan has indicated that he is considering supporting Gore over Jackson, who has few allies in the Empire State.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Notably silent throughout this drama is President Brown, who issued an endorsement when Jackson announced his run and uncharacteristically faded to the background, not campaigning with Jackson save for one appearance at a fundraiser in Chicago. Respecting Jackson’s alleged wishes to run as his own man, many are speculating that Brown will intervene to save his Vice-President. But when asked yesterday for the President’s thoughts, Press Secretary Westrup had nothing to say except that the primary was the Vice-President’s affair, inadvertently drawing more attention to President Brown’s reticence. Time will show if the Vice-President Jackson will continue his independent streak, or if he will be forced to rely on President Moonbeam. Either way, Gore has put his campaign into dire straits, and it remains to be seen if he can engineer a comeback.

                  <h3>Press conference on the departure of Dick Gephardt 08/03/1993 - transcript</h3>

                      <p>‘’And ultimately, I feel as though I would be redundant here. President Brown has done more in his one hundred days than President Bush did in his whole term. There’s nothing I can do to advance the President’s agenda, but there’s plenty I can do for my home. I admire Senator Danforth, and I’m sad to see him go, but his departure is a great opportunity for me to represent the, with respect to other 49 states, the greatest state in America. I’ll take your questions now.’’</p>

                      <p>“Mr. Vice-President, what will you be able to do as Senator that you couldn’t do as Vice-President, a role that makes you President of the Senate?’’</p>

                      <p>‘’It’s about scope. As Vice-President, I have a duty to be unbiased and serve every state equally. If I serve in the Senate, then I can focus purely Missourian issues. Plus, I’ll be easier to contact.’’</p>

                      <p>‘’Mr. Vice-President, do you think the Omnibus budget bill will pass the Senate?’’</p>

                      <p>‘’You’re hurting my feelings. I thought this was supposed to be about me. No, but to be serious, I’ve worked with the Senate closely on the matter. I understand that there’s been uproar from certain media outlets about the tax hike - it’s on the top 1%. It’s a simple rejection of trickle down economics and demonstration that the administration is serious about getting the debt under control.’’</p>

                      <p>‘’Mr. Vice President, is there any truth to the rumors that the administration intends to repeal the Hyde Amendment? And would you vote for that as Senator.’’</p>

                      <p>‘’There aren't any plans to do that to my knowledge. And I would of course vote against it. Abortion is necessary at times, but I don’t think making it commonplace is good for the fiber of American society.’’</p>

                      <p>‘’Mr. Vice-President, are rumors of a falling out between President Brown true?’’</p>

                      <p>‘’No.’’</p>

                      <p>‘’But you had made your career opposing NAFTA an-’’</p>

                      <p>‘’Well yes, I disagree with the President on some of his calls. But you never worked with anyone you disagree with? You’re not friends with people you disagree with on certain issues? If that’s the case, grow up. I support the President, 100%. I just dislike his decision in the matter. But it had no bearing on my decision to focus on Missouri - I will continue to support the President serving Missouri.’’
                      </p>

                      <p>‘’Mr. Vice-President, when the President was asked to comment on your departure, he said and I quote - ‘’To the victor go the spoils. Without that Mara, we’ll get so much done.’’ Do you care to comment?’’</p>

                      <p>‘’...No?’’</p>

                      <h3>Report on the path to victory against Richard Gephardt</h3>

                      <p>Chairman Merril,</p>

                      <p>While Vice-President Gephardt’s victory isn’t certain (see the Kerrey report), it is far and away the most likely outcome of the Democratic primaries. The Vice-President is a fairly typical Democratic candidate in most regards, with relatively high support in most urban regions while lacking relative support in rural and suburban regions. However, according to our internal polling and statistics, Gephardt figures to be an extremely difficult candidate to beat for the White House. According to our current forecast, there are well over 270 electoral votes that are strongly or likely Democratic; all other things being equal, Gephardt will win the 2000 election.</p>

                      <p>Considering Gephardt’s intimate link with the scrapping of NAFTA and our embrace of it for both Brown midterms, alongside Sen. Gramm’s campaign in 1996, trade policy has become a partisan issue by and large. Although it produced positive results in midterm elections, our path to victory is tennous with general election turnout. In terms of the electoral college, this has had disastrous consequences for our party; the union-and-industry-heavy Midwest has strongly identified with Brown and Gephardt’s anti-NAFTA, anti-free trade message and electorally rewarded them in 1996. Current polling and study suggests that we are currently on the road to an identical loss, unable to win a sufficient number of swing states.</p>

                      <p>With a free trade message, we are ahead or within five percentage points in polling in Missouri (11 EVs), Iowa (7 EVs), New Mexico (5 EVs) Tennessee (11 EVs) and Florida (25 EVs), amounting to 59 EVs. However, the Vice-President can rely on Wisconsin (11 EVs), Michigan (18 EVs), Ohio (21 EVs) and Pennsylvania (23 EVs) for 73 EVs. Gephardt can easily clinch victory by winning these states, and at the moment, all signs indicate that he will win them. With trade being a low propensity issue outside of the “blue wall,” it is unlikely we can use this as a wedge issue in “blue states.” In addition, although Indiana has long been a Republican stronghold, Brown’s strong improvement there in 1996 and Gephardt’s persistently high polling there might force us to play defense in the state. If we do not properly adjust, there is no mathematical path to victory, all things being equal.</p>

                      <p>Per my team’s evaluation, this leaves us with two options. The ‘’Rockefeller plan’’ would make investments in states like New Jersey, Oregon and New Hampshire–liberal in some regards but ambivalent on trade and with a history of strong statewide Republican performances–to “go around” Gephardt’s appeal to the Midwest by deemphasizing the party’s social messaging and promising to prioritize governmental competence over cutting programs. The concern is obvious: without proper material for our core voters, we run the risk of inadvertently depressing turnout. Additionally, it is difficult to see a moderate candidate winning the primary. With enough support, however, Sen. John McCain, Steve Forbes or Former Gov. Pete Wilson all could execute this plan properly and win over 270 electoral votes, according to our models. Notably, Wilson’s hardline immigration stances may be able to ensure turnout remains high without alienating moderate voters, but it could seriously harm us in Florida and New Mexico.</p>

                      <p>The alternative is to attempt to use the “Goldwater plan,” to support a staunch conservative whose stance on social issues could sideline the trade issue and turn the election into a referendum on morality. Under this strategy, we  would attack the Vice-President by tying him to controversial topics like the LGBT movement, affirmative action, and no-limit-abortions. Frmr Vice-President Quayle, Sen. Bob Smith and Frmr Rep. Newt Gingrich could all work for this plan of action. Like the Rockefeller plan, a “Daisy Ad” problem remains possible if the candidate strays too far rightwards in his messaging. Additionally, despite his evangelical bonafides, Gephardt is known for ideological flexibility in some areas, which could make him difficult to attach to these groups. Nonetheless, assuming that the candidate executes the plan, our models show that we would be able to win Ohio, giving us 279 electoral votes.</p>

                      <p>Note: Governor George W. Bush remains an issue. He appeals to people nostalgic for Frmr President Bush’s administration, but uses staunchly religious rhetoric while loudly advocating for moderate policy goals. According to our focus groups, Bush is far too religious for the Rockefeller plan and is far too publicly focused on centrist policy for the Goldwater plan. We must do anything possible to stop him ASAP. Under the Rockefeller plan, Bush could function as a good running mate, but he has no purpose under the Goldwater plan. Contact Frmr President Bush and implore him to take action to address this issue.</p>

                      <p>Maverick Redux: the DEMonstration of DEMagogues</p>

                      <p>A brief biography of Mitt Romney, the three-term governor of Massachusetts and the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee.</p>

                      <li>Basic details:</li>
                      <li>Born March 12, 1947</li>
                      <li>Education: Stanford University, Brigham Young University, Harvard University</li>

                      </ul>

                      <h3>Fun facts</h3>
                      <ul><li>Idolizes his father, a career underachiever of a politician who’s best remembered for his declaration that he had been the subject of a “brainwashing” to support the Vietnam war</li>
                      <li>Founded Bain Capital, one of the largest private equity firms in America and helped pioneer a system of acquiring businesses and cutting jobs en masse, laying off thousands</li>
                      <li>Despite holding strongly conservative personal views, claims to have been completely independent until registering to vote in the 1992 Democratic primaries for Paul Tsongas</li>
                      <li>Once went on a 12-hour road trip with his dog on top of his car in a windshield-equipped carrier, claims that it was nothing serious</li>
                      <li>Has claimed that 47% of the country are “beholden to McCain’s fabrications on Iraq” who “will vote for the president no matter what.”</li>
                      <li>Claims to be personally opposed to “socialistic healthcare” and gay marriage; forced all Massachusetts businesses to provide healthcare plans to their employees and stated that he would give marriage licenses to all homosexual couples, including those from out of state</li>
                      </ul>

                      <h3>Chronology</h3>
                      <p>1947: born to an automobile executive and an actress in Detroit, but grew up in an affluent suburb and attended private school</p>
                      <p>1968: while on an extremely unsuccessful mission in France, comes so close to death in a car crash that French police briefly declare him a fatality, just barely missing out on his own planet</p>
                      <p>1970: with his father having moved from Michigan’s governorship to the White House, declares his sincere belief in Nixon’s infallibility while John McCain was in the Hanoi Hilton</p>
                      <p>1984: after a fruitful business career, founds Bain Capital, where he makes obscene amounts of money at the minor cost of thousands of American jobs and livelihoods</p>
                      <p>1992: sparked into political action for the first time when he votes for Paul Tsongas in the Democratic primaries, later hosting a meeting with Tsongas at Bain Capital’s Boston headquarters and donating a significant amount to President Brown’s inauguration fund</p>
                      <p>1994: senses vulnerability in incumbent GOP governor Bill Weld and registers as a Democrat for the first time in his life to run against him, promptly winning by 0.4%</p>
                      <p>1995-present: governs as a so-called D.I.N.O. (Democrat in name only), constantly holding the corporate line on spending and taxes. Nevertheless, sprinkles in a few treats for the liberals such as being extremely pro-choice, allowing him to cruise to re-election two times</p>
                      <p>2002: gains national attention as the ringmaster of the Boston Winter Olympics, which he had forced through in 1995 despite public disapproval and a cost of millions of dollars. Is able to spin it off as a story of his supposed Moroni Midas touch</p>
                      <p>February 2003: immediately after the invasion of Iraq, announces his candidacy for President without taking a clear position on the war</p>
                      <p>November 2003: the moment that it’s safe to do so, announces his opposition to the war and his disgust at President McCain’s “lack of respect for our allies.”</p>
                      <p>March 2004: sweeps Super Tuesday after outraising and outspending his opponents by whopping margins, causing Paul Wellstone to go on national television and cry foul, to no avail</p>

                      <p>Three-term Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney saunters onto the Boston stage flanked by Carol Mosley Braun, having clawed his way to the nomination as the face of the moderate, sensible opposition to the war. With the looks and smile of the type of president one would see in the movies, he presents a case for the presidency based on his record, reliability, and his ability to balance his conservative and moderate impulses, a stark contrast to your maverick ways.</p>
                      <p>Mitt Romney talks a lot about getting things done, but doesn't seem to understand that he's had the benefits of working with an all-Democrat legislature, while I'm heading a divided Congress. He rubber stamps; I make deals.</p>
                      <p>Don't let the false niceness and the smile distract you from the fact that Mitt Romney is a tool of the Democratic elite. If we let him get a hold of the economy, he'll do what he did in Massachusetts and tax us to death while he's out yachting.</p>
                      <p>I can't seem to figure this fellow out, to be honest. One moment, we're supposed to believe that he's the type of family-first, fiscally sensible man who could be a Republican, and the next, he's publicly pledging his undying fealty to the tax-and-spend Democrats. Which one is it?</p>
                      <p>For four years, I've tried my hardest to keep our country safe and to restore American exceptionalism back to the presidency. Mitt Romney's idea of how this country would conduct itself internationally involves withdrawing from Iraq before it's stable and trying to antagonize Putin. Why isn't he focusing on the issues that actually impact us?</p>

                  <p>
                  WASHINGTON — President Bob Dole announced Sunday that he will end his presidential re-election campaign, bringing an abrupt and humbling conclusion to his half-century-long political career and scrambling the race for the White House less than four months before Election Day.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Dole, 77, could not reverse growing sentiment within his party that he was too frail to serve and destined to lose to Jerry Brown in November. Although Dole’s term saw mixed successes, including a surprising Republican overperformance in the 1998 midterms, many felt that he was undergoing some level of cognitive decline. These fears were amplified by Dole’s performance in a June interview with 60 Minutes, where he continuously stumbled over his own words and lost his train of thought, at one point claiming that he remained “burdened by Jerry Brown’s budget deficit,” despite the fact that Brown had left office with a budget surplus, simply staring at the interviewer with his mouth open when he was corrected on the issue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  After calls from those within his party to drop out, Dole resisted for three weeks before announcing his withdrawal. “I have been honored to serve as your president for the past four years. The first thing you learn on the prairie is the relative size of a man compared to the lay of the land. And under the immense sky where I was born and raised, a man is very small, and if he thinks otherwise, he is wrong. Four years ago, I pledged to be the bridge to a new America and I’ve come to the end of that bridge. That’s why I have decided it is in the best interests of this country for me to stand down from the election and focus on my duties as your president,” Dole said to reporters in a press conference. “I will speak to the nation later this week in more detail about my decision.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Dole thanked Hutchison for “being an extraordinary partner” in this conference and soon formally endorsed her for president in an interview with the New York Times.</p>
                  <p>
                  “My very first decision as the party nominee in 1996 was to pick Kay Hutchison as my Vice President,” Dole stated. “And it’s been the best decision I’ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kay to be the nominee of our party this year.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Dole and Hutchison spoke multiple times Sunday ahead of the president’s announcement, according to a source familiar with the campaign.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  In a statement, Hutchison thanked Dole for “his extraordinary leadership” and his “remarkable legacy of achievement.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  “I am grateful to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,” Hutchison said in a press conference this morning. “I will do everything in my power to unite the Republican Party — and unite our nation — to stop another disastrous term of Jerry Brown.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Dole’s withdrawal caps a singular national political career, starting in 1950 with his election to the Kansas House of Representatives. Dole later would be elected to Congress, winning a House seat in 1960 and serving for eight years until his election to the Senate in 1968. After being selected as Gerald Ford’s running mate in 1976, he mounted three presidential bids, finally winning in 1996. Beyond his presidency, Dole is well remembered for the 27 years he spent in the U.S. Senate. He rose to the chairmanships of the powerful Finance and Foreign Relations committees, along with eight years as the Senate Minority Leader.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Hutchison is expected to face an uphill battle in her road to the presidency, with former president Brown keeping a consistent lead in the polls throughout the race so far. Despite Brown leaving office with extremely low approval numbers, his favorability has skyrocketed since the end of his presidency. After Dole’s interview performance, his numbers slipped even further, as his approval rating fell to the mid-30s. Despite these headwinds, Hutchinson has enjoyed a massive burst of enthusiasm after Dole’s withdrawal. Many Republican leaders have joined Dole in rallying around the vice president, with former president Bush officially endorsing Hutchison for the Republican presidential nomination this morning.

						<p><span class="speaker">Officer Danehower:</span> So, is this like Cops?</p>

						<p><span class="speaker">Olivia Chen:</span> It’s close to Cops, sort of just ABC’s version of it. We’re just trying to do Cops, but with a more serious focus than, you know, crackheads and prostitutes. Normally, the cameraman, camerawoman, doesn’t do much other than stand there, but I’m supposed to be a lot more inquisitive than the guys they have over there.</p>

						<p><span class="speaker">Officer Ross:</span> I mean, there’s a lot of crackheads and prostitutes in this job. It’s just, like, the nature of the position.</p>

						<p><span class="speaker">Olivia Chen:</span> Oh, absolutely. But Cops, they’re cranking out episodes by the dozen. We’re trying to be a bit more selective with what we do. So, anyways, tell me about Nashville.</p>

						<p><span class="speaker">Officer Danehower:</span> It’s a good place to live. The crime can get pretty bad, but it’s not anything like Memphis, heh. It tends to stay in certain areas.</p>

						<p><span class="speaker">Officer Ross:</span> Well, that’s also not–</p>

						<span class="action-line">[The police radio crackles.]</span>

						<p><span class="speaker">911 Operator:</span> We’ve had an incident at the Hermitage Hotel downtown, possible shooting. I’m sending you two to go look at it.</p>

						<p><span class="speaker">Officer Danehower:</span> Roger that. We’re on our way.</p>

						<span class="action-line">[The police cruiser drives through downtown Nashville before parking outside the Hermitage Hotel. The officers walk in confidently.]</span>

						<p><span class="speaker">Officer Ross:</span> This’ll be interesting. This place is just a standard nice hotel, not usually too much happening. I can only think of maybe one or two times when I’ve been called here.</p>

						<span class="action-line">[The officers walk to the front desk.]</span>

						<p><span class="speaker">Officer Danehower:</span> We got a call from you guys, someone saying that there was a possible shooting in your hotel?</p>

						<p><span class="speaker">Receptionist:</span> Yes, officer. About ten minutes ago, we had a guest call down to the front desk and claim that they heard gunshots.</p>

						<p><span class="speaker">Officer Danehower:</span> Do you know who made this call?</p>

						<p><span class="speaker">Receptionist:</span> Room 606, who said that they thought it was coming from room 607. That’s Governor Clinton’s room.</p>

						<p><span class="speaker">Officer Ross:</span> Governor Clinton, you mean the one from Arkansas?</p>

						<p><span class="speaker">Receptionist:</span> Yes, sir. He’s staying with us tonight.</p>

						<p><span class="speaker">Officer Danehower:</span> Okay, well give us a room key, and we’ll go up and see what’s going on.</p>

						<span class="action-line">[The trio rides in the elevator up to the sixth floor.]</span>

						<p><span class="speaker">Officer Danehower:</span> In situations like this, where there’s only a shot or maybe a short burst, you don’t want to walk in with your guns out. So, uh, we’re just going to go give a knock or two and remain cautious.</p>

						<p><span class="speaker">Olivia Chen:</span> I see.</p>

						<span class="action-line">[The trio walks to room 607. Officer Danehower knocks on the door.]</span>

						<div class="narrative-text">
							<p>(Scientific police scurries around the compact hotel room. All of a sudden two homicide detectives walk in. They are greeted by the coroner.)</p>

							<p>"Agents Castillio and Baker, homicide. Sorry for the delay."</p>

							<p>"Ah, detectives,” postured the Coroner, walking up to them. "I was wondering when you'd show up."</p>

							<p>"We got here as fast as possible. You know how traffic gets downtown," lightly rebutted Baker. "Cut us some slack."</p>

							<p>"What are we looking at here?" enquired Castillio, the lead detective on the case, while mindlessly staring at a painting of the woods that decorated the entrance.</p>

							<p>"Follow me, gentlemen."</p>

							<p>The room was actually in better condition than Castillio had expected. Sure, the bed was messy and a suitcase was lying haphazardly on the floor, but if it wasn't for the police tape and the lab boys, he may have thought he'd wound up in the wrong room.</p>

							<p>This illusion was shattered as soon as he turned his vision to face the bedside table. On it lied, hunched over, the body of the victim...</p>

							<p><strong>Governor Bill Clinton.</strong></p>

							<p>"The first responders discovered the scene at around 4 PM,” the coroner began, briefing the detectives on the case. "They were officers Danehower and Ross of the NPD, along with Olivia Chen of the American Broadcasting Corporation. They were apparently shooting for something TV-related around Jefferson Street when they suddenly got a call from the hotel. Considering it took an odd half hour to get from there to here, the time of death has been placed between 3:00 PM and 3:30 PM."</p>

							<p>He then continued, this time guiding the detectives towards the body of the victim.</p>

							<p>"The victim was shot twice in the head, as indicated by the blood spray. After pulling the bullets out, we found that their markings matched those of an M1911."</p>

							<p>"Standard use army pistol," added Baker. “My dad brought one home from his service in 'Nam. Maybe the perp's a veteran with a blown fuse."</p>

							<p>"As much as it frustrates me, I don't think we can discern much of a motive behind the murder. It could have been another head case like Lee Harvey Oswald, or maybe we're looking at something that's much more grim. But hey, that's what the department has you two smartypants for, right?" He allowed himself a small grin, adding contrast to the somber matter the men found themselves in.</p>

							<p>Castillio and Baker quickly exchanged looks before recomposing themselves.</p>

							<p>"With that being said, I'll leave the investigations up to you. If you need, I'll be in the hallway talking to the lab team."</p>

							<p>With that, Castillio and Baker joined forces with the other officers already on the scene.</p>

							<p>"Did the security cameras catch anything suspicious?” Castillio asked one of the officers.</p>

							<p>"Negative, sir. Nobody but the Governor was seen entering this room,” he responded, seemingly dejected due to the complexity of the situation at hand.</p>

							<p><em>Unless he got killed by a ghost, there must be an entry and exit point somewhere,</em> Castillio thought to himself.</p>

							<p>Instinctively, he reached for a packet of cigarettes he kept in his pocket at all times, even though he knew full well he wasn’t going to smoke at a crime scene. Perhaps due to the somber mood, his hands failed him as he reached for the packet, causing it to fall onto the ground.</p>

							<p>As Castillio went to pick up the packet, he noticed something off. The carpet on which the wardrobe was positioned looked to be curved and stretched, almost as if it had been moved ever so slightly to cause such a deformation.</p>

							<p>He blinked, his brows creasing with confusion. Maybe he wasn’t seeing the carpet correctly. After all, it was a very hot day in Nashville, and the ventilation system was seemingly not helping. He'd been in cheap, shady motels that had functioning vents, so how come this ritzy monolith of a palace couldn't figure it out? His eyes shot up to the room's vent, located just above the wardrobe...</p>

							<p>And that's when he noticed something.</p>

							<p>The vent's grate was loosened, leaning onto the vent instead of being fixed on it with bolts.</p>

							<p>"What purpose would the perp have gotten out of making this loosened grate look normal? Do murderers have to take a mandatory room decor class? Wait... could it be that..."</p>

							<p>While Castillo was on the cusp of having a breakthrough, Baker was half investigating, half gazing through the hotel window in the opposite corner of the room.</p>

							<p>Clinton's room was on one of the highest floors of the hotel, and it was very close to the roof. The view from there was stunning, to say the least.</p>

							<p>From there, Baker could see cars, people, trees, a falling piece of paper, the clouds, other buil-</p>

							<p>Wait, what? Did a piece of paper just fall from above the window? He looked out of the open window and craned his head upwards.</p>

							<p>That's when he saw it.</p>

							<p>Like a shadow, a strange figure bolted–well, more like crashed–into the nearest window upon being spotted, dropping another paper in the process.</p>

							<p>"Son of a bitch," Baker grumbled.</p>

							<p>He stuck his head back into the room, before yelling "Cas! That rat bastard is still here! Follow me!” He caught the pensive Castillio off-guard, but the detective managed to recover.</p>

							<p>The two detectives bolted out of the room and made a beeline for the highest floor, muscles straining as they bolted up the stairs.</p>

							<p>They didn't know what to expect when they'd find him. They didn’t know why he would still be at the hotel so long after the murder. They didn't know whether he'd put up a fight or surrender immediately. They didn't know if this was going to be the last flight of stairs they walked up.</p>

							<p>All they could do was hope.</p>

                  <h3>LUCAS APPROVES STORY THAT KILLS HAN SOLO AS FANS REVOLT AND PRESIDENT BROWN CONDEMNS</h3>


                  <p>A great disturbance has rocked the Star Wars fanbase. As if there hasn’t been enough disturbance from the new film Episode I: The Beginning, which came out in May of this year to mixed reviews, controversy has once again reared its head in the world’s largest sci-fi fandom. In an extremely controversial turn of events in the new novel The New Jedi Order: Strike From Beyond, Han Solo, the space pirate turned Rebel hero, has been killed off. The decision, approved by George Lucas and Lucasfilm and officially written by R.A Salvatore, has created a great deal of backlash from fans around the world.</p>

                  <p>Star Wars has long had various novels associated with the franchise, but they have often been criticized for their vapid, low-stakes nature. Under new publisher Del Rey Books, Strike From Beyond was intended to begin a darker, more mature tone for Star Wars novels going forward. No one, however, expected the death of a fan-favorite character in the first novel of what is supposed to become a 23-book series. Close to the end of the book, protagonist Han Solo sacrifices himself to save his son Jacen Solo and his best friend Chewbacca, along with other civilians, as they escape on a transport from the new invaders of the galaxy, called the Yuuzhan Vong.</p>

                  <p>Within days of the book’s release, internet chat rooms and fan clubs were in utter disbelief and filled with outrage. Countless threats, petitions, and other messages have flooded Lucasfilm’s office in Marin County, California.</p>

                  <p>“Han Solo was my favorite character,” said one person who will remain anonymous. “I–we all grew up with him. It just doesn’t make sense to kill him off like he’s meant to be expendable”</p>

                  <p>Author R.A Salvatore, best known for his work in the fantasy genre, has become the biggest scapegoat for the character’s death, even though he insists it wasn’t his decision.</p>

                  <p>“I was told to kill Han,” Salvatore said, “I wasn’t the one who came up with the idea. I love Han as much as everyone else, but it's just what Lucasfilm wanted.” Despite the statements, some revolted fans have begun burning their copies of Strike From Beyond, and, similar to Lucasfilm’s office, have sent threats, angry letters, and other messages and emails to his house and his website.</p>

                  <p>The decision to kill Han has become a national news story on the level of the White House, as President Brown addressed the backlash yesterday while giving a speech to a South Carolina high school. “The death of a character in a book does not warrant wishing death on real people,” Brown said. “Han Solo stood for freedom, not for sending death threats behind a screen or on paper. I absolutely understand all kinds of grief, but sending death threats because you didn’t like a story you read is cowardly.”</p>

                  <p>In typical Brown fashion, he found a way to connect the story’s events with a real-life analogy from his administration, comparing the fans’ resistance to accepting this change with his 1994 Energy Transition Act, which defunded fossil fuel subsidies in favor of renewable energy. “I was told that I was killing the country, and now, they’re saying a writer killed Han Solo. But killing, death, is not an absolute. Things can still get better, and maybe these fans will eventually appreciate the decision, like they did with the Energy Transition Act.”</p>

                  <p>Lucasfilm and Del Rey defended the controversial decision, framing it as an important step to make ideas fresh going forward. “The New Jedi Order is a series about consequences,” said editor Sue Rostoni. “We were aiming for a reason for readers to believe that no character, even a movie character fundamental to the franchise like Han Solo, is safe.”</p>

                  <p>Despite the publicity created from this decision, from a financial standpoint, it seems to have backfired, as the sales from Strike From Beyond have underperformed several past Star Wars books such as Timothy Zahn’s The Thrawn Trilogy and his standalone Vision of the Future. Still, taking The Beginning’s $1.2 billion dollar gross into account, the performance of a single book likely will not greatly impact Lucasfilm’s finances. However the events of the first novel affect the rest of the story of The New Jedi Order, one thing is for certain: the galaxy will surely miss Han Solo, and so will the fans.</p>


                  <p>EDITOR’S NOTE: A “Han Lives” movement has recently been gaining traction online, calling for Lucasfilm to reverse the decision. Lucasfilm has refused all requests for comments on the matter.</p>

                  <h2>Exit Polling and Opinion Polling Paints a Clear Picture of Brown’s Mandate
                  </h2>
                  <h4>Oscar Washington, Los Angeles Times
                  </h4>
                  <h4>November 8, 1996

                  After President Jerry Brown’s crushing victory in Tuesday’s presidential election, even those who were predicting a Brown victory were taken aback by the size of the landslide. However, according to the newest data from exit polls taken at election, alongside other opinion polls, Brown’s victory was backed by a strong coalition of ideological liberals, minority voters, fiscal conservatives, and crucially, those who supported his handling of the wars in Afghanistan and Sudan. Of the 60% of Americans who voted for Brown, 73% said that his military record as commander-in-chief was the primary reason that they selected him. Notably, the self-described 17% of conservative Republicans who voted for Brown listed his handling of the wars as their primary reason for voting for him at a rate of 91%. Interestingly, conservative independents, of whom Brown claimed 34%, only listed his handling of the war as their primary motivation with a 60% majority, with his fiscal policies, including efforts to decrease the deficit and restructure taxes, coming in at 25%, higher than any other group. Brown also received 38% of the vote from self-described born again Christians, roughly doubling his percentage from 1992. As expected, Brown cleaned up with liberals, with 96% of liberal Democrats, 70% of liberal independents, and 54% of liberal Republicans selecting him, and also won the moderate and independent votes by wide margins. However, although he was already projected to do well in the category, he made unexpectedly deep gains with minority voters. In addition to being the choice of 48% of the white population, Brown won 90% of black voters, 83% of Hispanic voters, and 52% of Asian voters, winning a majority of the group after losing them by 20% in 1992. One of the few groups that Brown didn’t do well in was with voters whose yearly income was over $100,000, winning 44% of the bracket, though he easily won every other income category.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Perhaps the greater electoral story of the election was President Brown’s Republican opponent, Phil Gramm, and his chronic unpopularity. Although voters consistently agreed with some of Gramm’s political views, they rejected that man himself, giving him a 36% approval rating in the last post-election poll. When asked what their primary reason for disapproval was, 34% of respondents listed his personal character as a top priority, with many specifically pointing to Gramm's investment in a pornography film as proof of his moral flexibility. Another 27% of respondents specifically listed Gramm’s campaign policy to “Slash the red tape oneverything” as the top factor in his unpopularity, with Gramm’s promise to cut funding to many well-liked government programs seemingly hurting him. Of Gramm’s policies, his most popular was to continue President Brown’s policies in the wars in Afghanistan and Sudan, with 64% approving of Gramm’s position Beyond Gramm’s obvious weaknesses, the third-party campaign of Pat Buchanan clearly dug into Gramm’s support. Of Buchanan voters, a whopping 73% said that Gramm was their next choice in the event that they had to choose between him and President Brown. At the same time, Buchanan also had unique ideological backing. Despite 77% of Americans approving of Brown’s handling of the wars, 83% of Buchanan voters listed Buchanan’s opposition to the wars as the primary reason for their decision, with the next closest percentage, only 7%, saying that they chose Buchanan because Gramm wasn’t conservative enough. This conservatism hurt Buchanan overall, though, as only 32% said that they had a positive opinion of him, with 55% describing him as too extreme to be president. As expected, Buchanan’s only strong demographic was Americans opposed to the wars, with 59% of anti-war voters selecting him.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  As far as voting demographics of the war go, a titanic 97% expressed condemnation for the acts of 26/2 and the collapse of the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Mastermind Ramzi Yousef’s capture in September, widely seen as a monumentally important moment in the campaign, was an action that 92% of voters approved of, although 40% said that they wished he had been killed instead. 64% approved of President Brown’s plan to withdraw from Afghanistan by June 1997, while 70% approved of Brown’s plan to withdraw from Sudan by March 1998. When asked about the nation’s priorities, 86% listed defended the nation from terrorism as such, the highest out of any issue, including a strong economy at 78%. Less than 1% approved of Al-Qaeda, though only 23% were able to identify the group’s leader, Abu Ubaidah al-Banshiri, while 87% knew the deceased former leader Osama bin Laden. As the first president since George Washington to win a unanimous victory in the electoral college, holding an approval rating of 74%, Jerry Brown has a decisive electoral mandate from a wide-reaching coalition. It remains to be seen if his popularity will hold, especially since the president has openly stated that he wants to focus on domestic policy in office with the wars set to come to an end in 17 months. Given his near-supermajorities in the Senate and House of Representatives, it seems likely that whatever legislation the president passes won’t need to go under much negotiation, and will be judged on its own merits. Nevertheless, at this moment, President Brown can thank his unique popularity for his victory in an election that seems certain to reshape American politics.

                                        <h1>A Greater Privilege</h1>
                                        <p>The excitement had been building for hours inside the Westin Galleria Hotel in Houston. First, the noncompetitive states had come in—Alabama, South Carolina, Utah—inspiring mild cheers from their partisans. Then, there’d been a raft of Republican-leaning states. These had been no great surprises; there were no stunning upsets from what the forecasters had predicted. Still, their number had steadily grown—173 to 188 to 191. The crowds had watched the screens at his Election Night party, bouncing between despair and anticipation, until finally, CNN called it. There were still votes to be counted, but according to their projections: George H. W. Bush had avoided defeat. A cheer went up through the building.</p>
                                        <p>He could hear their shouts echoing through the building, but the sensation George felt in the big hotel room was exhaustion. It had been a hard four years and an even harder campaign. His body felt ragged, overused. He imagined himself as a rag doll struggling itself stitched together after weeks of being jerked around.</p>
                                        <p>George was aware of a shape standing in the door. He turned and saw his personal assistant, a loyal man, holding a cell phone. For a moment, he let himself feel a bit of excitement. “Michael, is that Governor Brown calling for his concession?”</p>
                                        <p>The man shook his head no. “Uh, no. I, uh, was able to get through to Mr. Bush like you—. I mean, I was able to get through to your son. I know you’d wanted to talk to him before…”</p>
                                        <p>George offered some vague New England platitude, took the phone, and ushered the man away. Then, he took a breath and took the call off hold. “Hi, Junior. Glad you stayed up.”</p>
                                        <p>There was the sound of breathing on the other end. A hand something down on a counter. “Your daughter-in-law went to bed, but I’ve been talking to Jeb.” A pause as the voice on the other end took a bite of something. “He’ll probably want to call you when things settle down.”</p>
                                        <p>“I see!” He blinked a few times, forced himself to straighten up in his chair. “Well, that’ll be something to really look forward to.” He wandered around the hotel room, busying himself by making sure that his tie was straightened and peering into the monitor that displayed the happy crowds in the hotel’s conference room. They were playing This Land is Your Land, a song he had used in 1988. “It was a good night. It was good for everyone.”</p>
                                        <p>“I suppose you managed to clear the bar and win an election.”</p>
                                        <p>“Oh, certainly. It’s going to be a new era moving forward, Junior. No more having to worry about legacy, nothing about being less than Reagan.” He continued staring into the tiny monitor. He wished they would cheer louder, make themselves heard to Junior over the phone. “Things are going to be different these next few years.”</p>
                                        <p>There was a long pause. George was sure their call had been disconnected. Then, in a voice that mixed with the static came a low rumble. “No, Poppy. It’s not.”</p>
                                        <p>In the background, the irony of him using Woody Guthrie’s scathing critique of greed and American unexceptionalism finally clicked with him. George gripped the phone hard.</p>
                                        <p>“You’ve made your choices. You can't go tellin’ me there’s going to be a new beginnin’ or anything. None of this fresh start stuff is real. This country got started down a path already, y’know? By winning, all you did was guarantee, uh, that you’ll be the one dealing with the consequences of your actions, and not Jerry Brown.”</p>
                                        <p>“Okay.”</p>
                                        <p>“No one’s going to bail you out of your messes for you, Poppy. This isn’t Iran-Contra.”</p>
                                        <p>George was quiet and stared at his feet. He swallowed to bury the heavy feeling in his throat. “Well, Junior, I have to go now. The crowd out here is getting excited, and they’re letting me know that I should give my victory speech so that I can get to bed early. We can talk about this later, alright?”</p>
                                        <p>There was an exasperated sigh through the receiver followed by the sound of somebody loudly munching on a pretzel. “Alright. Well, I’m gonna go to bed anyway. Don’t forget that Jeb will call you. We’ll have a nice long talk in the morning.”</p>
                                        <p>“Okay, Junior, I love you,” said George, only to be interrupted by the sound of the call disconnecting. He let the drone of the silent telephone bore into him. He allowed himself a few brief moments of quiet before putting back on his mask of professional competence and exiting his room. He forced himself to emerge and greet his many smiling aides, quickly complimenting them or shaking their hands. Then, with Barbara at his side, he stepped out onto the stage before blinding stage lights. He could not see the crowd in front of him but he could hear their voices.</p>

He won the 2002 race for governor “in spite of my best efforts.” He identifies as a Democrat instead of a Republican because “My daddy went to Greenwich County Day and I went to Midland San Jacinto Junior High.” He claims that “Religion plays a major role in my life because otherwise, I would sleep in until 2:00 on Sundays.” Despite this, the self-deprecation never gives way to actual hatred, always teetering just on the side of good-natured, folksy Texan fun.
                  <br><br>But when Bush talks to an audience, rather than an individual, people listen up. Any casual sarcasm or humor that might exist in the personal interaction is completely abandoned in the public address. While he still occasionally dips into the folksy pot, the bumbling aspect is replaced by extreme seriousness and sharpness, almost like his more-famous father has, for a brief moment, stepped in and taken over his body. The roads? He’s fixing them. The legislature? He’s working with them. The schools? He’s making them better. Every pertinent detail is delivered with the accuracy of a laser-guided missile, aimed at the cerebral cortex of every Texan voter.
                  <br><br>However, the George Bush of four years ago, who stormed into office off of standard midterm backlash to President Cheney, was a different man than he is today. Back then, he was forced to straddle two challenges at the same time: first, to explain why he was a Democrat with the last name Bush, and second, to explain why a Democrat should be elected in the first place in Texas, which has swung increasingly toward the Republican column in the past decade. Of course, he passed–barely, edging out Joe Barton in a race that was decided by less than 10,000 votes. But if you thought that Bush, facing questions over his political identity, coming into office facing a legislature who wasn’t prone to agreement with him, to put it mildly, was going to timidly step into his role as governor, you thought wrongly.
                  <br><br>“It’s hard work, plain and simple,” he says. “Hard work can only get you so far, since you need to have luck, but if you have that little bit of luck, all I can say is to watch out.” Bush soon proved himself to be the most prominent governor in the history of Texas, appearing at every public ceremony, shaking every hand, until even the most completely apolitical Texan could tell you exactly what Governor Bush was doing, and how it positively impacted him or her. Marrying a conservative’s overt religiousness (he proudly wears the label of born-again Christian and cites his Methodist faith for every major decision) with a liberal’s belief that people are inherently equal and deserve to be treated as such, he has managed to consistently achieve policy wins that seek to make the state a better place, starting with the nuts and bolts. As a result, he’s become wildly popular, now possessing a 70% popularity rating and looking certain to annihilate ultra-conservative Republican Chip Roy, a no-name lawyer, come November.
                  <br><br>With this in mind, then, Bush seems certain to try and make a jump to the White House in 2008. He checks all of the boxes. First, of course, he is wildly popular. Second, his last name gives him near-universal name recognition. Third, he has shown an uncanny ability to win over groups that Democrats traditionally struggle with. Fourth, he has assembled a far-reaching network of donors who could easily finance a national campaign. Without having directly implied a candidacy yet, he constantly places within the top three of Democratic primary polls (the newest Quinnipiac poll has him ahead of Howard Dean, but behind Paul Wellstone), even as some question whether a Democrat as conservative as him can win over the liberal base which votes in the primaries.
                  <br><br>However, if George W. Bush wants to be president, he will have to confront the monkey which has been on his back ever since that fateful day in 1992, when it came out that he had been arrested for drunk driving in 1976. Immediately, rather than support him, his father instead, as he puts it, “kicked me to the curb,” chastising his son’s decision making while doubling down on the law-and-order aspect of his campaign. The younger Bush, who had been a loyal surrogate to his father in 1988 and had continued to campaign loyally in 1992, was stunned. He was even more stunned on election night when the votes were counted and showed Jerry Brown beating his father. All of that had been for absolutely nothing.
                  <br><br>“After that, I went on a journey,” muses Bush. “I spent some time getting really involved with the Rangers, took it on myself to spend more time with Laura and the girls, and just tried hard not to think about politics at all.” After rampant speculation that Bush would run for Governor of Texas in 1990 (a decision he ultimately chose not to take on his mother’s advice), not a single soul suggested that he give it a go in 1994. It was a wise choice, as even in a Republican-leaning midterm, Ann Richards cruised to reelection.
                  <br><br>Eventually, Bush felt the hunger for politics, even as his internal ideological barometer had begun to drift left of center. As he puts it, “It was time for me to become my own man. I wanted to do what my Poppy had done, but up to that point, I had always tried to do it with his approval. Eventually, I realized… I realized that I didn’t need it.”
                  <br><br>When Bush announced that he was running for office in 2002 as a Democrat, it sent shockwaves across the state’s political landscape. Had the son really betrayed the father like that? Bush never made an issue of it, simply noting that he was seeking to become governor as a member of the Democratic party, and nothing more. George Senior publicly endorsed and campaigned with Governor Barton, although many felt that he pulled his punches–only slightly–against George Junior. Many still feel that to some extent, despite their public break, he is living in his father’s shadow, a notion that Bush contests.
                  <br><br>“Heck, I still talk to Poppy often and still have the keys to the house in Maine. We’re cool, you know? It’s still like father, like son.” Though Bush pays due homage to his father, he never lets the conversation remain fixated on them or their relationship for too long, always seizing the initiative to talk about his own plans. Still, if there is one sign that Bush really has grown more comfortable with who he is, it is the name that he uses.
                  <br><br>For years, Bush was publicly uncomfortable with the use of the name “Junior,” always preferring George, W. (Dubya), or just George Bush. Now, he takes it all in stride, saying that whether in the current campaign or in the event of any hypothetical presidential run, he will not try to correct people any further. “Junior, George Jr., even Shrub, you can call me what you feel. A name is just a name, even a famous one like mine. The only power that a name has is the power of the man behind it.”</p>

					GOP Gubernatorial Candidate Neel Kashkari Stabbed to Death on Fresno Streets
					<span class="update-badge">Updated</span>
				  </h1>

				  <div class="ap-meta">

				  <div class="ap-body">
					<p>
					  <span class="dateline">FRESNO, Calif. (AP) —</span> In a tragic turn of events, Republican candidate for governor Neel Kashkari was killed last night while sleeping on the streets of Sacramento. Kashkari, 41, was intentionally living as a homeless man for a week in order to draw greater attention to California’s homelessness crisis, which he accuses Governor Jerry Brown of causing and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Debra Bowen of ignoring.
					</p>

					<p>
					  According to campaign staff and recovered video footage, Kashkari, a former banker with Goldman Sachs who was a key economic advisor to then-candidate Mitch Daniels during his 2012 presidential campaign, planned to live homeless for a week with only $40, a pair of clothes, shoes, and a backpack in order to provide material for his faltering campaign.
					</p>

					<p>
					  Kashkari was born to Indian immigrants in Ohio in 1973 and grew up in Stow, a suburb of Akron, before receiving his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in mechanical engineering from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. After a short stint working as an engineer, Kashkari earned his MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania before becoming a banker at Goldman Sachs, working in their San Francisco branch.
					</p>

					<p>
					  His first notable political experience was in 2008, when he took a leave of absence from Goldman Sachs to help draft economic policy for Illinois Governor John H. Cox’s failed Republican primary campaign. Although Cox dropped out of the campaign after coming in third place in New Hampshire, Republican operatives widely believed Kashkari had done well, and he stepped away from his job permanently to work as an advisor on Mitch Daniels’ 2012 campaign.
					</p>

					<p>
					  After the campaign, Kashkari returned to California, where he founded an education nonprofit organization before announcing his run for governor, claiming that Governor Brown had spent the last eight years destroying the state as part of a “vanity project” to boost his ego after his 1992 presidential loss. Coming from the left side of the Republican party’s flank and espousing liberal views on topics such as gay marriage and gun rights, Kashkari finished second behind California Secretary of State Debra Bowen in the June 3 gubernatorial blanket primary, winning 32% to her 53%. Although widely seen as a longshot to win the general election, he enthusiastically threw himself into campaigning, even as he continued to fall behind Bowen in the polls.
					</p>

					<p>
					  Over the past week, Kashkari had been living as a homeless man on the streets of Sacramento in a stunt to boost his campaign, trying to showcase the difficulties of California’s economy and its services to help the homeless. Although the first four days of living homeless passed without serious issue, according to police reports, he was stabbed to death while sleeping on a Fresno street after angering a fellow homeless drug addict, whose identity is currently not public information. After his body was found by a passerby, Kashkari was taken to the Kaiser Permanente Fresno Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.
					</p>

					<p>
					  Commemoration of Kashkahi has been wide-reaching, with President Daniels issuing a statement saying that “Neel was one of the most gifted people I’ve ever met, and someone whom the world is a much lesser place without." On the opposite side of the political aisle, Secretary Bowen said that she is “shocked by this senseless act of violence” and has vowed to stop campaigning for the near future, while Governor Brown described him as “a very good man of high character.” Kashkari is survived by his father and mother, Chaman and Sheila Kashkari, sister, Meera Kashkari, and his fiancee, Christine Ong.

						<p>Good morning.</p>

						<p>Last night, our closest and oldest friend the United Kingdom sustained a direct attack from terrorists. A hijacked plane crashed into Parliament during a delayed session of Question Time, killing nearly every MP present and possibly dozens of innocent people outside Parliament. This act of terror was done to try and destabilize and destroy the United Kingdom. It has failed, and the country remains secure. I recently spoke to acting Prime Minister Gerry Sutcliffe, and I can say with certainty that America will be supporting him as we work to keep the United Kingdom stable.</p>

						<p>I have also directed the CIA to collaborate with MI5 closely to help them uncover who exactly was responsible for this devastating attack, but one thing is very clear; the forces of terror have struck not just the United Kingdom, but every free nation at once. We must come together and work to prevent this evil from ever happening again.</p>

						<p>To the United Kingdom—I cannot honestly say I am capable of properly comprehending the devastation, the chaos or the heartbreak for the dozens if not hundreds of lives lost. But I promise this; I am with you. America is with you. And the free world is with you. You as a nation saw evil, the very worst of human nature. And you have responded with the best of human nature. With the bold actions of your rescue workers, with the compassion of strangers saving strangers and with the near immediate national unity, you have inspired us all.</p>

						<p>I hope the American people join me in a minute of silence as we listen to God Save the Queen.</p>

						<p>Thank you. And God bless the United Kingdom.</p>

								<p>On a normal Monday Pentagon briefing, newly minted commander-in-chief Jerry Brown, who had finally ascended to the nation’s highest civilian and military rank on his fourth try, met with Secretary of Defense Jack Reed and other Pentagon top brass to discuss the administration’s approaches to conflict in the Middle East.</p>

								<p>The group was supposed to view a presentation created by an aspiring army personnel, one M. A. Milley, commander of the 3rd Armed Corps in Texas, on possible routes the Brown administration could take in regards to the inherited wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Prior to the meeting, Brown had repeatedly stressed the need for a united roundtable discussion, which every American commander was encouraged to take part in, regarding foreign policy and the country’s approach to terror cells such as Al-Qaeda or the increasingly active Daesh, going as far as to say that the armed forces needed to “get their act together” in a closed cabinet meeting back in February.</p>

								<p>The presentation was submitted via URL on the White House’s confidential email server. However, when Secretary Reed clicked on the link through his laptop, which was connected to a projector in the room, instead of war plans, the president and his aides were subjected to the YouTube video of Rick Astley’s hit 1987 pop single “Never Gonna Give You Up.”</p>

								<p>Initially, Reed tried closing the video player window. However, the window through which the video was being broadcast was frozen and refused to budge. Reed then attempted lowering the volume, but befell a fate similar to the first attempt. Finally, Reed decided to simply go ahead and let the music video play out, but to the dismay of the officers sitting in the room, the video was set to loop every time it ended. Finally, the SOD powered off his laptop by holding down the power button. Milley swore that he had “no clue” over what may have happened, leading some to believe that the commander’s email may have been breached, allowing an unaffiliated, unidentified third-party to spy on top-secret Pentagon information.</p>

								<p>The incident has already been used numerous times to bash the administration for its perceived incompetence, with radio host and political pundit Rush Limbaugh stating that “the same way you can't teach an old dog new tricks, you can't expect a decrepit, old, has-been to be able to defend our country.”</p>

								<p>It's no secret that Brown’s old age certainly did him no favors in the election, considering the breadth of his narrow win over Republican candidate Mike Huckabee. It goes without saying that this incident only adds fuel to the fire, legitimizing the claims that Brown is too “out of touch” with the modern world and technology.</p>

								<p>Regardless, it appears the President won't take this lying down. On Tuesday, he already issued a sweeping investigation into the Department of Defense, aimed at maintaining OPSEC (operational security), as well as a personal investigation into this supposed third party, calling it a “vicious cybercriminal group” which “must be brought to justice.”</p>

								<p>As for Milley, with few in the armed forces willing to vouch for him, a demotion or dishonorable discharge is looking more and more like a serious possibility.</p>

                  <h1>Dayton, Ohio. November 8th, 2016</h1>

					<div class="timestamp">6:00 pm</div>

					<p>Away at college, Charlie had been dreading the fall semester in early 2016. She had graduated with her art degree, and had to move back in with her parents. That meant hearing a whole bunch of political discussion, with them constantly taking shots at her more liberal views. As much as she loved her folks, and tolerated her brother, they were very stupid. They said that college had brainwashed her, but she had always been sharper than them. Her parents were really just simple laborers. Unthinking denizens of Middle America. The vast silent majority. Cruz voters. Morons.</p>

					<p>Charlie’s ruminations were interrupted by her dipshit brother. “Charlotte!” He knew it was Charlie, the asshole. “You coming down for the results?” She considered staying in her room, chatting online with fellow Brownshirts, hoping for a miracle. Beyond her phone, it was really just the My Chemical Romance posters in her room, though dated, still provided comfort. But she couldn’t resist. Poking her head out the door and pottering down the stairs; the election spread awaited her on the coffee table like a feast at a royal table. Chips and cookies and beer, oh my. Her portly father smiled and patted the seat next to him. “Now Charlie, I know you may not like the results, but we’re family first and foremost.”</p>

					<p>Charlie smiled and nodded gingerly. “You uh, really don’t think Jerry will pull it off?” From behind, Charlie's mother scoffed and sauntered in, holding a tray of pretzels and cocktail sausages, before plopping down at the table. She chewed on a pretzel like a cow, letting her two brain cells rub together as she collected her thoughts.</p>

					<p>“Now, Charlie, I know that Mr. Cruz isn’t quite the same as President Romney. Maybe a little less charming, sure. Maybe he has a few issues. But he’s a strong man, and he’s going to be a good president. Especially with how just… peculiar that Brown fellow is, I mean, I just don’t see how Cruz loses. Besides, Brown already lost back in the day, and Cruz has been leading in all of the polls, after all. That thing with the documents, people don’t really care about that. The polling is never this wrong.”</p>

					<div class="timestamp">7:00 pm</div>

					<div class="news-flash">
						And we can call Kentucky for Cruz, and Vermont for Brown
					</div>

					<p>“See, look at that lead. Sorry Charlotte, but it’s, it’s academic. It’s over for Jerry.” Charlie smiled and nodded at her brother’s insistence. “It’s difficult to see a path to victory without Kentucky, sure. It’s like losing West Virginia. Devastating.”</p>

					<p>The matriarch dipped her chip into the dip, savoring it slowly. The newscasters noted how Brown had won 45% of the vote in Warren County. “Hey,” said the mother, “that’s funny. I have some cousins down in Bowling Green. Wonder what’s going on down there, heh.”</p>

					<p>That was an interesting result, wasn’t it? Indeed, as the results came in, it seemed like Kentucky was a shade bluer than last time. West Virginia, called as soon as the polls closed, also seemed a shade bluer. But would it be enough? Charlie was unsure. The Brownshirts faced strong odds, after all.</p>

					<div class="timestamp">8:00 pm</div>

					<div class="news-flash">
						Ted Cruz has won Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Oklahoma; Jerry Brown has won Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island.
					</div>

					<p>Charlie’s brother looked at the screen, confused. “The South Carolina results, shouldn’t those have been called already?”</p>

					<p>The father just nodded. He cast his ballot for Cruz, of course, but he’s not quite as invested as the rest of his family. The way he sees it, most of politics is tricks by crooks anyway. “Well, maybe they’re just taking their time. Cruz is going to win that one anyway. Everybody knows that.”</p>

					<div class="timestamp">9:00 pm</div>

					<div class="news-flash">
						Ted Cruz wins North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Louisiana; Jerry Brown wins New York, New Mexico.
					</div>

					<p>The matriarch massaged her temples. “Indiana, why haven’t they called Indiana? Cruz has been leading the polls there by a ton. They should’ve called that one the second the polls closed, along with Kentucky.”</p>

					<p>Charlie just looked at the results. The margin in New Mexico was impressive, really impressive. Brown had doubled what Feingold had got there in 2012. The Dakotas had only shown a little bit of movement, but Louisiana seemed to have a purpler tone than usual, even if it had been called immediately.</p>

					<p>She finally relented and helped herself to a pretzel, washing it down with a glass of water. It wasn’t half bad, really. It was a pretty decent attempt at a pretzel.</p>

					<p>Later, the television sounded.</p>

					<div class="news-flash">
						“And now, we can project that Jerry Brown has won the state of Colorado.”
					</div>

					<p>Charlie’s eyes darted up, as did those of her brother. What time was it? 9:45? Colorado was supposed to be a swing state; Romney had won it by a hair. The camera cut to a shot of Brown’s election night rally, where people were cheering and chanting. Was this the start of something?</p>

					<div class="timestamp">10:00 pm</div>

					<div class="news-flash">
						We can now call Indiana, South Carolina, and Louisiana for Ted Cruz.
					</div>

					<p>The brother roared. “There we go, there we go! See, they came back home, they always come back home!”</p>

					<p>The mother nodded in approval. “That’s good. It’s a good start. I feel like they should’ve called Texas by now, right? Cruz is a Texan, so you know that they’ll all turn out to elect one of their own.”</p>

					<p>Charlie, meanwhile, was watching the Ohio results. She felt like she had been one tiny blue vote in a sea of red, but as the results came in, the map was starting to look funny. Hamilton County was going blue. It never went blue. Something was happening.</p>

					<div class="timestamp">11:00 pm</div>

					<div class="news-flash">
						With 80% of the vote in, we can safely project Florida going to Jerry Brown.
					</div>

					<p>Charlie jumped in the air. Florida! Hell yeah!</p>

					<p>The other three people in the room just sat there in stunned silence. This couldn’t be happening. Jerry Brown was too much of a kook, too far outside of the mainstream, to win. This guy? Seriously? This loser had won Florida?</p>

					<p>The brother ran his fingers through his hair. “That can’t be correct. They still haven’t counted the votes in the panhandle. That’s deep Cruz country, very religious people. I mean it’s… it’s just not possible. Romney won the state by four. Cruz is a Cuban! Hispanics love him! You just wait for a bit, once they count all of the votes, it’ll be just like 2000. They’ll retract the call… they have to retract the call.”</p>

					<p>The mother had moved from eating to frantically chewing her nails. “Cruz can’t have lost Florida. No way. They love him down there. He’s the perfect candidate for the state.”</p>

					<p>The television flashed that Cruz had won Idaho while Brown had won Oregon. Charlie yelled, “Oh, damn, Cruz got Idaho! Call the whole election, it’s all over now!”</p>

					<p>The father just sat there and cracked open a beer as North Carolina, Michigan, and Pennsylvania were called for Brown.</p>

					<div class="timestamp">12:00 pm</div>

					<div class="news-flash">
						Jerry Brown has won the state of Ohio and exceeded 270 electoral votes. Jerry Brown has been elected the next president of the United States.
					</div>

					<p>The father had passed out on the couch. The mother had a Bible in her hand and was fervently praying, asking how this had happened. The brother was beside himself, asking how this could possibly have happened.</p>

					<p>Charlie just sat there smugly, reveling in all of it. “Now everybody, we’re all family here. You guys might not like the results, but it’s just politics, right?”</p>

					<p>“Fuck you!” screamed her dipshit brother, as her mom completely ignored her.</p>

					<p>“Hey, there’s virtue in being gracious in defeat, right? Isn’t that what you guys told me four years ago? Suck it up, buttercup.” Laughing to herself, Charlie walked back up the stairs and went back to her room, back to the My Chemical Romance posters. Suddenly, Ohio didn’t seem so bad at all. The world didn’t seem so bad at all.</p>

					<p>She laid back on her bed, put her headphones in, letting the soothing sounds of Fall Out Boy wash over her. It still didn’t feel real, but she was happy nonetheless. Sure, she was happy for the prospect of Jerry Brown. It was true. But really, what had made her day wasn’t the results of the election, but that she had gotten a chance to get one over on her idiot family. That made all of it worthwhile.</p>

					<p>“Total outlays may not exceed total receipts for a fiscal year, unless three-fifths of the members of each House of Congress provide by law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a roll call vote.</p>

					<p>There is a permanent limit on the amount of the public debt. This limit may not increase unless approved by a three-fifths majority in each House by roll call vote.</p>

					<p>Any bill to increase revenue may not become law unless approved by a majority in each House by roll call vote.</p>

					<p>The provisions of this amendment do not apply for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is in effect, or if the United States faces an imminent and serious military threat to national security as declared by a joint resolution which becomes law.”</p>
				</blockquote>

				<h2>The Balanced Budget</h2>
				<p>A movement to balance the United States’ budget began in the 1980s, when the public began to get increasingly worried that the country was spending too much money compared to what it was earning. In 1992, President Jerry Brown was elected largely because of his popular promise to create an amendment to balance the budget, making it required for the government to spend no more than it earns.</p>

				<h2>The Original Proposal</h2>
				<p>The amendment was first introduced by Senator Milard Tydings of Maryland in 1935, but it was mostly ignored at the time. Later, in 1982, a vote for the amendment passed in the Senate, but failed to get ⅔ of the vote in the House.</p>

				<h2>Finally Passing Congress</h2>
				<p>The momentum for passing the amendment then stopped for many years. It wasn't until the early 1990s that Congress once again began to look at the amendment. In 1992, both candidates for president, Republican George Bush and Democrat Jerry Brown, supported the amendment. After Brown was inaugurated as president, the Senate voted in early 1993 after the House passed it, but failed to pass the amendment by one vote. President Brown, who had supported this amendment throughout his whole political career, called a special session of Congress in the Spring of 1994. He urged them to pass the amendment. Finally, on May 10, 1994, the Senate passed the amendment.</p>

				<h2>Ratification of the States</h2>
				<p>Since many states already had their own balanced budget amendments, and because the idea had gained popularity, the amendment was quickly ratified by a large number of states. By March of 1995, thirty-seven states had ratified the amendment. However, one more state was needed to meet the three-fourths requirement of the Constitution. Several states had also rejected the amendment and the final decision came down to the state of Nevada.</p>

				<p>When the Nevada state legislature voted on the amendment, it first appeared to be deadlocked in a tie. Then state senator Dina Titus changed her vote and voted for the amendment on December 6, 1995. She later said that although she was against the amendment, everyone in her community was in favor of it, making her realize that it was better to pass it for the common good.</p>

				<h2>The Balanced Budget</h2>
				<p>The year of 1996 was the first time that the U.S. government was required to balance its budget. This was mostly achieved by spending less on the military.</p>

				<h2>Interesting Facts about the Twenty-Eighth Amendment</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>It is sometimes referred to as Amendment XXVIII. It has the nickname the "Brown Amendment" after President Brown.</li>
					<li>The only state that has not ratified the amendment is Vermont.</li>
					<li>The government has only spent more than it has earned in two years since the amendment was passed, in 2014 and 2015, when President Chet Culver and Congress agreed to spend extra money to help the struggling economy.</li>
					<li>In his successful re-election campaign in 1996, President Jerry Brown nicknamed himself “Slash,” after a famous guitarist, due to his willingness to cut spending.</li>

						Eyewitness account from Irina M. Samoylova,<br>translated into English by D. K. Robertson
					</h3>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">It was at this time that I decided that it was my turn to do what I suppose you could call my own version of a “walkabout.” Somewhere in my family, one of my ancestors on my mother’s side had been Evenki, an ancient Siberian tribe who lived in the far north of Russia. We seemed 100% Russian to me, but it had long been ingrained in my mother’s family that every woman, once they come of age, must go on a journey in the wild in order to better connect with nature, for it was the natural spirits who made up the structure of the universe. I wasn’t sure how much I believed that, but my mother and my aunt had done it, as had their mother, and so on and so forth.</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">Finally, when I turned 22, my mother sat down with me and suggested that it was my time. Although I wasn’t looking forward to such an experience, I wasn’t dreading it either, and I let her guide me on where to go. Our family had lived in Krasnoyarsk for hundreds of years, and according to family legend, these journeys had occurred all over the Krai. We explored a great number of virtual maps together, until she finally landed on a journey through the sheer wilderness. I was to start from the town of Vanavara, which had its own small airport I could fly into, and make my way on skis to the settlement of Oskoba, 80 kilometers away. From there, they had a landing strip that I could use to call in a plane that would take me back to Krasnoyarsk. We were fortunate, very fortunate, that airfare in Siberia was so cheap.</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">In the depths of January, with the temperature far into the negatives and snow blanketing the ground, I found myself in Vanavara. The local people were quite amused at me doing such a thing, but most of them seemed more impressed than anything. After all, I had a navigation system and satellite connection, and if the absolute worst came, I could get out of it. Rather than worry, people were just fascinated that I had the audacity to even try in the first place, and several wished me luck.</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">And so, after a night of solyanka and vodka, I found myself setting out the next morning, ready for a grueling two days of skiing. Still, the snow covering everything gave the world a sense of wonder and beauty, and it gave me the energy to keep on going onwards. The first day passed in solemn, solitary wonder, and although I would be lying if I said that I felt like I was getting in touch with those Evenki spirits, it was a truly cleansing experience, me and my body and nature all moving in synchronization. As night approached quite early in January at that latitude, I started looking for a place to make camp for the evening.</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">After I had pitched a tent and made a fire, I took the chance to look at where I was using geolocation. That was when the bad news started: somehow, instead of going roughly along the course of the Podkamennaya Tunguska river, on a fairly straight shot to Oskoba, I had veered farther north, going into the Tunguska basin and the northern marshes. I was far, far away from Oskoba, decidedly in the middle of nowhere and with a minimum of two extra days of skiing, maybe even three. I was decidedly screwed.</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">Then, things got even worse and it started snowing. The snow started to come down harder, threatening to cover my entire tent. Desperately, I got out of the tent and tried to see how bad it was. I quickly realized that it was even worse than I had thought, and that the snow was somehow more heavy than I had realized. Now was definitely the time to make a call. I quickly tried to get my satellite phone working, but my hands were too cold, even through my gloves, and I slipped with it several times. Finally, I was able to actually touch the buttons on the phone, only to realize that they didn’t work.</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">Dejected, I crawled back in my tent and curled up for warmth. I was probably about to die, and I sat there crying, trying to make my peace with it. I was just 22; I wasn’t ready for it. And so there I sat, on the path to an early rendezvous with fate. Was this really how it was going to end?</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">After sitting there for some time, I heard a set of footsteps crunching through the snow. Maybe it was a bear or something, here to put me out of my misery. Maybe I was, for real, about to die, not from the cold but from the appetite of a grizzly. Whatever it was, I turned my eyes to the tent’s entrance as it slowly unzipped, and as a white, blinding light filled my vision, I fainted from fear.</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">When I woke up, I didn’t recognize my surroundings at all. I was sitting in a lounge chair inside some sort of cabin, rough-hewed but clearly made with love and care. In the corner, a large fire burned, giving me the warmth I so desperately needed. Over the fire hung some sort of flag, with a picture of a bear over some words in English that didn’t make any sense to me. The rest of the cabin was simple, consisting of a wardrobe, a bed, a table, a cabinet, and a stove. The only other decoration I could see was a picture of a family, a black-and-white one, with a father and mother lovingly looking at three girls and one boy.</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">Suddenly, the cabin’s door opened, and in walked a man wearing a fur coat, matched with a fur hat and leather boots. As he shut the door and restored the room’s warmth, I got a better look at him. He looked to be a youngish man in his mid-30s or so, with piercing brown eyes, a strong, slightly thin face, and styled dark hair whose graying sideburns gave him a touch of authority. He took off his coat and sat down across from me, his eyes piercing through my skin into my Siberian soul.</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">“Welcome to my home. I’ve been called a few things over the years, but you can call me Edmund.” His Russian was grammatically perfect, but it was betrayed by a strong foreign accent that made it sound like he was almost launching the words out of his mouth. “You’re really lucky that I happened across you out in the woods like that. I don’t know if you would have survived much longer.”</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">“Thank you, thank you so much,” I responded, “but what… what is this? This is Siberia. We’re so far away from everything. How do you live out here? What even is this?”</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">Edmund’s eyes lit up, although he didn’t quite form a full smile. “Yeah, that’s a question that I’ve asked myself a lot over the years. You can either hear the short version, which will be confusing but will be fairly easy to digest, or you can hear the long version, which will make perfect sense only if you, who I’m guessing is a college aged girl from Siberia, having an encyclopedia understanding of some old history of the United States.”</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">“Is there a middle path? Maybe one where I get an explanation but I’m not confused?”</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">This time, he really did laugh. “I don’t know that there really is one, but I’ll try my best here. A long time ago, in America, there used to be 50 states joined together by one federal government. It was like that when I was growing up, but as I became an adult, it got worse and worse. There was a group of people dedicated to hoarding as much wealth and power as possible for themselves, and they slowly began seeping into every corner of American society, infecting the nation.”</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">“But, there was still some hope. You see, I was the leader of one of these states, they elected me–yes, we used to have actual elections back then–and I tried my hardest to resist this group of people, this cabal. I failed, then failed again, then failed again so hard that I went on a journey around the world to see if there was any hope left at all. And in India, deep inside the bustling city of Calcutta, I met a holy man who told me that if there was truly no hope left, that my only salvation was to travel north, to the land that had been punished by God himself. There, in the midst of His destruction, would I find humanity’s last chance.”</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">“I paid no mind, and on that journey, I met some people, did some things, that made me think that I still had a chance. And so I returned to America, where I made my last stand against this cabal. For a moment, I thought that I was to be victorious, but I miscalculated. I miscalculated terribly, and lost a stunning loss, the type of ground-shattering type of event that makes you realize that nothing is ever really going to be the same after it.”</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">“So I left America for good, and in that time that I left, the cabal grew and grew and grew until it had engulfed the whole government, swallowing it whole. If you know about America’s Time of Troubles, that’s when it really started. But I wasn’t in America: I was traveling across Asia, in search of this Northern land the holy man had spoken of. First, I scaled the icy peaks of the Himalayas, scouring Nepal and Tibet for a sign, but to no avail. Then, I scoured the vast emptiness of the Gobi Desert and the Mongol steppes, searching for any evidence of this punished land, but still without a resolution.”</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">“In that time, my bones began to grow weary, and my body began to break down. As the world fell deeper into a panic, as the markets and systems crashed, I found myself up here, in Siberia, in search of this punished land. And then, in a place not too far from here… I found it.”</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">“And what was it? You’ve told such a dramatic story.”</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">“What was it? Even if I told you, you wouldn’t believe me. Just know that out there, tucked away deep within the forests, is proof that we’re not alone in this mortal realm. Whatever it is, it gave me the strength to carry on, to regain my energy, my vigor, that I had lost in my search.”</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">“And here in Siberia? Why stay? What else could you possibly have to do if you found it.”</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">Edmund laughed again. “That is a question for me, and me only, to know. All you should know is that one day, when I’m needed the most, I’ll come back to society. Until then, I’m quite content to enjoy some nature here. It’s really lovely, if you didn’t already know.”</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">I was completely bewildered at this man’s story. More likely, he was just some sort of hermit from some insane sect who had decided to throw it all away and live by himself. Maybe he planned to slit my throat in his sleep, for all I knew. Still, I had to play nice.</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">“So, what now?”</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">“Now, we make sure that you get your rest up, and I’ll make sure that you get sent in the right direction.”</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">Edmund got the stove working and made me a soup which was surprisingly enjoyable. Then, we sat around the fire and started a new conversation, this time about Russian history, that segued its way into a whole host of other things until we finally arrived at modern Siberian techno music, which he was surprisingly well-versed in, just as he had been on every topic. Perhaps the story had just been something to mess with me.</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">The next morning, Edmund gave me the most efficient directions possible and sent me on my way, cheerfully waving me off. I gave him one last glance, him and his little hut, and by the next time I turned my head, they were completely gone in the snow. I fought through the snow like my life depended on it, and somehow reached Oskoba that very night, which came as quite a surprise to the locals. None of them had ever met Edmund or heard of him.</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">The next day, the plane came to pick me up, and I was back in Krasnoyarsk like nothing had happened, right on schedule. I tried to shake the whole experience off, but it was just too much to bear, and I went to my mother to talk about it. When she saw me, she turned as white as a sheet, slowly touching my skin, as if she was trying to tell if I was real. She explained to me that my aura had the mark of the Evenki spirits in the same manner that one would be marked for death, but I was somehow fine despite that. I told her about my experience, and she was just as confused as I was, musing that perhaps Edmund was on the run from the law in some sense.</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 20px;">That summer, when all of the snow had melted, I went back up to the Podkamennaya Tunguska area, this time with my mother, in search of the mysterious man. We chartered a plane which covered the entire area that I could have possibly travelled by ski and used the newest technology to search it down to the smallest rock, but there was just nothing. He wasn’t there. Despite that, I always had a feeling, a feeling that my mother began to share, somehow based on the spirits or the like, that I hadn’t seen the last of this Edmund. And indeed, as we all learned later, I hadn’t.</p>

				<p>The other day I was at a yard sale, looking at all the objects that my neighbor seemingly didn't want anymore. As I was looking, my eyes landed on something peculiar: a copy of <strong>Moonbeam 92</strong> for the Nintendo Gamecube. I remember my parents gifting it to me for a birthday, but after I finished middle school, the game seemingly vanished. Oh, how I'd dreamed of playing <em>Moonbeam 92</em> again! And there it was, right in front of my eyes. I asked my neighbor about it, and when I did, he suddenly seemed to tense up a little, and I noticed that his eyes avoided my gaze, even if for a single second. Anyway, after purchasing the game, I went home to start playing it. I pulled out my old Nintendo Gamecube, inserted the disc in, and got ready to have a blast.</p>

				<p>Immediately, however, things seemed off. Instead of being assaulted by the Dead Kennedys blaring at full volume, my ears were instead met with silence. Still, I thought nothing of it, thinking that maybe my old Gamecube was glitching out.</p>

				<p>I pressed forward, playing the mod and having much fun doing so. However, halfway trough it, the game suddenly crashed. I quickly powered off the console and removed the disk, to check if perhaps it was scratched. The disk, however, was spotless, like it had just been bought.</p>

				<p>After inserting the disk inside the console again, things got even weirder. All of a sudden, the music was back, seemingly louder than before. I decided to continue playing the mod, thinking that it was just a glitch. However, on the same question as before, something horrible happened. The advisor feedback image was telling me to <em>"open the door"</em>, with a picture of Jerry Brown staring at me. I was confounded. Then, all of a sudden, Jerry Brown's eyes began bleeding <strong>hyper-realistic blood!</strong> I could not take it anymore and I shut the game off, shaking and crying. I decided to head to bed for the night, but as I did that, I heard a noise behind me. I turned around and... I saw him.</p>

				<p class="scary-text">Jerry Brown. In my living room. His eyes were black like charcoal, his face contorted into a sickly grin. In his left hand, he held a drawing of two fictional women kissing, in the other he had a knife.</p>

				<p>After snapping out of my trance, I ran up the stairs to my room, where I locked myself in. Once I did, I had to block the door with my whole body to keep Brown from entering. Thankfully, I had brought my phone with me and was able to dial 911. My heart was pounding, and so was my bedroom door. However, I was relieved when I heard the police arrive at my door. They broke down the entrance and swarmed the house, eventually getting me to leave my room…</p>

				<p>However, they had found no one. Had I just imagined things? After they left, I grabbed the <em>Moonbeam</em> disc, got into my car, drove to the nearest river, and dropped it in. And there it lies to this day, untouched by anyone. However, I’m scared that Brown will one day come back, and stab me under the Moon’s beam.</p>

					<div style="color: #333; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 15px;">
						<p>James Bond (Timothy Dalton) is part of a governmental team of observers dispatched to Edinburgh, Scotland, to tour a new weapons facility set to produce field equipment for M16. As the group makes its way through the tour, Bond notices that the guide doesn’t use proper British measurements and becomes suspicious that he is an enemy agent. After the guide shows off the factory’s crown jewel, a new computer-powered ball bearing used for the aerospace industry, he confirms Bond’s suspicions by stealing the computer bearing and locking the group in a testing room in the facility, making his escape by glider. Bond is able to escape the room and chases after the glider on the ground using his Aston Martin. After a lengthy chase in which Bond attempts to shoot the glider down by pistol, to no avail, he’s able to land a shot on the glider with the last bullet in his chamber, just as it appears to have outpaced him, sending it crashing to the ground in a fireball.</p>

						<p>In London, the newly-appointed female M (Judi Dench) assigns Bond the job of working as bodyguard for British billionaire Mark Henley (Michael Billington), the owner of the Scottish weapons facility, as several attempts have been made on his life. M suspects that the attempted theft of the computer bearing and the assassination attempts are correlated and that someone is attempting to undermine British national security. After a brief meeting with Q (Desmond Llewelyn) and receiving a special laser watch, Bond gets acquainted with Henley at his country manor before the two of them set out to Hong Kong, where Henley is set to give the keynote address as a technology expo. At the expo, Bond accompanies Henley to a private meeting with U.S. Senator Harold Braun (Anthony Hopkins), a hugely popular devoted pacifist and practitioner of Buddhism who questions Henley on the ethics of producing deadly weapons and raises alarm as to their environmental impact, finding his answers unsatisfying. During the meeting, Bond attempts to make small talk with the head of Braun’s security team, Dieter Kessler (Ferdy Mayne), who despite appearing to be in his 70’s, possesses the strength and reflexes of a man in peak physical condition.</p>

						<p>While walking through the expo, Henley goads Bond into trying a game meant to show off new biofeedback technology in which two opponents are pitted against each other to see who can concentrate harder, staring straight into each other’s eyes while doing so. Bond easily defeats the first two opponents before finding himself stymied by the third, Tatiana Solntseva (Famke Janssen), a Russian chess grandmaster attending the expo in order to play against a new chess computer. Although Tatiana nearly defeats him, Bond is able to get the edge by winking at an inopportune moment, flustering her. After a speech by Senator Braun in which he talks about the opportunity to create a world perfectly in balance with the end of the Cold War, Henley takes the stage. Bond, watching the audience for threats, notices a suspicious potential shooter perched on the upper balcony of the speech hall, and attempts to warn Henley, who ignores him and promptly is shot, with the shooter fleeing on foot.</p>

						<p>Bond chases the shooter throughout Hong Kong, first on the rooftops before transitioning to a motorcycle on foot throughout a city market. Midway through the chase, he’s surprised to see Tatiana also chasing after the shooter, and fights with her for leverage in the pursuit. Eventually, the shooter makes his way to Kowloon Walled City, where he engages in a fistfight with Bond and Tatiana simultaneously before falling to his death. However, Bond is able to reach the shooter’s body, discovering a lanyard identifying him as an aide to Senator Braun, though he loses all trace of Tatiana.</p>

						<p>Bond, suspicious of Senator Braun, tracks him to Los Angeles, where Braun has a large mansion. After breaking in, Bond witnesses a meeting between Braun, Kessler, and Ukrainian computer scientist Boris Glushko (Alan Cumming), who reports that he is in dire need of a few specialized components in order to complete what he refers to as Operation Zen. After Glushko leaves, Kessler catches Bond and brings him to Braun, who explains to Bond that the collapse of the Soviet Union has created a unipolar world where the United States, by adding Eastern Europe and Russia to its hegemony, will be able to hold onto global superpower status indefinitely, destroying all notions of planetary balance, from the environment to the population to global politics, suppressing all movements that speak out against the “corrupt hivemind” in Washington. Braun explains that he will re-balance the Earth, but purposefully neglects to tell Bond how, before leaving him to die at the hands of Kessler, who drugs Bond and drives him out to Compton, planning to drop Bond on the street and kill him and a mock “drive-by” shooting.</p>

						<p>Just as a still-drugged Bond appears certain to die as Kessler’s hands, Tatiana, driving a Ferrari F355, reappears and gets Bond into the car. As the effects of the drugs wear off on Bond, Tatiana lures Kessler’s henchmen into a shootout, accidentally also attracting fire from local gangsters, with chaos ensuing as Bond, Tatiana, and Kessler all manage to escape. That night, as Bond is recuperating from a bullet graze, Tatiana confides to him that she’s a former KGB agent who is now a part of the FSK. As part of her mission, she was tasked with keeping account of nuclear warheads on former Soviet territory, only to discover that 30 had gone missing, which she was able to trace back to Senator Braun. Before Bond and Tatiana can enjoy their time together, Bond gets a call from M, who reveals that every model of the computerized bearings has been stolen from the deceased Henley’s Scottish factory.</p>

						<p>Breaking back into Braun’s mansion, Bond and Tatiana are able to deduce that Braun has flown to Krakow, Poland. After they arrive in Krakow, Tatiana finds an old KGB contact, Dmitri Pavlovich (Robbie Coltrane), who reveals that many former Red Army and Polish soldiers have been recruited by new employer, working at an abandoned former Soviet air force base. The pair drive to the base, which seems initially uneventful, only to discover a massive nuclear missile bunker and silo underground. Once there, they’re caught by a backstabbing Dmitri, who takes them to the bunker’s central control room, where Senator Braun, Kessler, and Glushko are meeting. Senator Braun explains that his plan to rebalance the world zen is to launch a massive missile strike using the lost Ukrainian missiles, using the computer bearing technology to aim them precisely and to avoid defense systems, on the capitals of the world’s “debalancers” (listing the USA, Britain, France, and Iran as a few examples of many) and the world’s biggest polluters, creating a new multipolar, non-consumption focused world. Bond criticizes his plan as madness, but Braun simply laughs him off before ordering that Bond and Tatiana be chained to a missile.</p>

						<p>While chained to the missile, Bond and Tatiana struggle before Tatiana is able to activate Bond’s laser watch, enabling them to cut through the chains and escape. Making their way through the bunker and taking out many of Braun’s henchmen, Tatiana is able to decalibrate the missiles by breaking onto Glushko’s computer, disarming the payload and sending them to the middle of the ocean. Senator Braun, unaware that the missiles have failed, is meditating in a private room when Bond and Tatiana walk in on him. Braun challenges Bond, contrasting his ideals of peace with Bond’s crude violence and claiming that Bond shooting him would only prove his point. Before Bond gets the chance to answer, Tatiana pulls the trigger.</p>

						<p>Throughout the rest of the bunker, the henchmen are in panic as Polish special forces swarm the area, but Kessler is able to make his escape, making it to the surface. Bond and Tatiana make it to the surface soon after, seeing Kessler running across the air base’s runway. Bond, realizing that he’s too far, sees an old Mig-29 and has an idea. He and Tatiana get in the plane and, flying at a low altitude, impale Kessler on the jet’s nose. Once the pair are fully in the air, Bond makes contact with M16, proclaiming that the job is finished. Although M presses Bond for more details, he turns her off and switches the plane on autopilot as he and Tatiana consummate their relationship in the sky.</p>

                  <h4>Dan Quayle:</h4> <li> No. You’re really doing an impression of a child actor who used to do an impression of me. You know it, I know it, and the American people know it.</li>

                  <p>How is he getting away with it?<br><br>

                  No, seriously, how is he getting away with it?<br><br>

                  It’s 1993 and Jerry Brown is president, which is already an absurdity in its own right. But this Jerry Brown, rather than being the unpopular fringe figure that he should be, given a thumbtack-sized mandate and a tendency to be a loose cannon, is instead one of the most popular men in America.<br><br>

                  What?<br><br>

                  Well after his honeymoon period should have ended, how is Jerry Brown sporting a nifty 66% approval rating?<br><br>

                  The answer is simple: he’s running the same playbook that propelled him to national prominence in California, almost 20 years ago. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Certainly, Brown’s first month and a half in office was filled with all of the pitfalls one would have expected of him. He charged into office with reckless abandon, declaring that he was building a New America, pledging to get rid of the old, broken one as he peppered the bureaucracy with nonstop executive orders for anything he desired and bum rushed the White House with a motley crew of aides from all sorts of nontraditional backgrounds. In short, he was America’s wacko-in-chief, surrounded by loons, trying to pass maniac policy. Predictably, his approval ratings tumbled, sitting underwater after only a month and a half.<br><br>

                  Then, somewhere in his head, a switch went off, and Jerry Brown decided to remind the world that he was actually good at this whole politics thing. In early March, he announced that he would be moving out of the White House for a Capitol Hill-adjacent studio apartment, declaring the White House too busy. He started a habit of walking to work every day, a habit that he’s kept up despite Secret Service pressure, making small talk with random pedestrians as he goes. Although he doesn’t have a famous girlfriend to help keep the spotlight on him, he’s intentionally made himself perhaps the most public-facing president ever, hardly ever taking a day off and making sure that the cameras record his every action. Even his brief vacations are spent in the public sphere, surrounded by celebrities, such as his hiking trip to Utah where he stayed at Robert Redford’s house, or his two-day visit to Key West where he drank margaritas with Jimmy Buffett. One has to wonder if he can keep up with his schedule, but he’s shown no signs of stopping for now.<br><br>

                  But making himself relatable to the American people is only one part of the game. Sure, perhaps the President has traded Sacramento for Washington and the Plymouth for a sturdy pair of shoes, but Congress is a whole different beast than the California state legislature. How was somebody as mercurial as Brown going to manage Congress? The answer, as it turns out, lies in canoe theory, first articulated by Brown himself in the mid-70s in front of an audience of Sacramento high schoolers. The idea is simple: in order to move a canoe forward, you have to paddle right and then paddle left, back and forth. According to Brown, the same is true for politics: even if your starting position is relatively far on the left or on the right, you can maintain your forward progress by staying in your lane through a series of zigzags and course corrections. This theory has worked like a charm in nudging Congress to be cooperative. For instance, Brown announced his plans to cut taxes for all brackets, paddling right. Then, he made sure that the reconciliation bill that passed closed every loophole possible and raised corporate taxes, paddling left and increasing overall revenue. Brown has repeated the same strategy within the executive branch: first, he paddled right by reducing funding for the Department of Education, then paddled left by placing grant incentives on states who improve their education bureaucracy, pleasing both sides.<br><br>

                  It’s impossible to say where Brown goes from here. In California, his popularity was partially harmed, if never fully killed, by his naked ambition for higher office. Now, in the highest office in the land in the world’s only superpower, he has nowhere higher to go. With several legislative successes under his belt already (he cites the Clean Environment Act as his proudest achievement, although his most popular according to polling is his tax bill), his next target is the white whale of Democratic presidents, the comprehensive healthcare reform which has proved yet impossible to achieve. However, Brown’s plan, which is essentially a copy of South Korea’s healthcare system, has proven to be widely popular among the public, with many Republicans admitting in private that they won’t be able to stop it. While some of Brown’s loftier ideas, such as prison reform, will likely remain theoretical, his hold of Congress has proven surprisingly firm.<br><br>

                  While it’s possible that an unforeseeable crisis or overstep of his boundaries could send Brown’s political star hurtling back to reality, the fundamentals remain good even as the midterms creep ever closer: Jerry Brown is a communicative leader presiding over a growing economy who has been able to make things happen. Considering the decidedly unimpressive size of his mandate, his popularity is quite the feat. For now, perhaps it’s best to just sit back and observe the Moonbeam as he shoots through the stars, heading to his next adventure. <br><br>

							<strong style="color: #2c3e50; font-style: normal;">VOICEOVER:</strong> Live from Oakland, California, it’s We the People with Jerry Brown.
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong style="color: #2980b9;">JERRY BROWN:</strong> Welcome to another edition of We The People. This is a radio program dedicated to exposing the follies of the political class, that privileged and arrogant group that runs our country like a private club. We take apart the conventional wisdom; at least we do our best to take it apart, the wrongheaded and the dumb ideas that are dragging us all down. By the nature of what we do, politicians have to lie to us, and we the people have to call them on it. As for the greed of the corporate high and mighty and the phoniness of the wannabe liberals–we’re taking them on, too. There are no sacred cows on the show. Yesterday we talked about the latest political scam: George Bush’s balanced budget amendment. It’s really quite pathetic: you have a man who was vice president during some of our biggest deficits ever, never said a word about it, and now that he’s wrapping up a presidency that was completely stillborn, suddenly we’re trying to pretend that Bush is the great consensus-builder when he’s really just piggybacking off of ideas I’ve been fighting for, ideas that others have been fighting for, for much longer than he has.
						</p>

						<p style="text-align: center; color: #7f8c8d; font-style: italic; margin: 20px 0;">
							(Jerry pauses to inhale and exhale)
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong style="color: #2980b9;">JERRY BROWN:</strong> Well, and if you’ve listened to me, if you’ve followed my political career, then you know that I’ve supported such an amendment, many times in the past, so this next part might seem like it’s going to be something of a surprise, which is that the Balanced Budget Amendment is a stupid idea put forth by stupid people. Now, a lot of people might ask me what happened to the person preaching fiscal responsibility? Well, here’s what I’m going to tell them: I am. I've just gotten a lot less arrogant about this, taken the time to study some actual economists, like what’s his name, William Vickrey, really brilliant Canadian who I’ve had the privilege of meeting last year. And when you run the data, and look at how other countries, like Denmark, other places, how they model their approach, it becomes clear: forcing a requirement for a balanced budget is dense, just plain dumb. Running a balanced budget, that’s great, something we should try to do, but it creates perverse incentives, the type of incentives that George Bush is all too familiar with, him and our Congress, to purge the wrong types of spending, increase inequality.
						</p>

						<p style="text-align: center; color: #7f8c8d; font-style: italic; margin: 20px 0;">
							(Jerry takes another pause to inhale and exhale)
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong style="color: #2980b9;">JERRY BROWN:</strong> Before we talk about just why this amendment is garbage, we need to talk about who’s passing it, and why the Democrats, my party, aren’t standing in the door opposing it. Congress, I mean, they’re worrying about what's good for the corporations and not for us. Well let me just add a point to that. You know you have two parties, a Republican and a Democrat in Congress. There's one independent, Bernie Sanders from Vermont, a great guy. But you have to look at the Democratic House incumbents. The ones that were there in ‘90, who ran in ‘92, that’s fifty percent of the money for those House Democratic incumbents that came from political action committees, and of the top forty recipients of PAC money, thirty seven were Democrats. So yeah it makes it look like we have one party with two wings. You know you have the Democratic wing and the Republican wing. But the money which buys the T.V. ads in the computer letters and keeps the incumbents there at a rate better than eighty percent. The same people. Well, just until you actually do change the face of the Congress. Nothing's really going to get done

						<p>
							<strong style="color: #2980b9;">JERRY BROWN:</strong> And so now we have a caller, Mike from Indianapolis. Hi, Mike from Indianapolis, you’re on the line.
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong style="color: #d35400;">MIKE FROM INDIANAPOLIS:</strong> Hi, Jerry, thanks for having me on. So I’m a steelworker, worked as part of a union for over 20 years now, and I have to ask, how exactly does the balanced budget hurt me? Because as far as I understand it, this national debt of ours is just going to keep growing, and we’re going to have to keep paying more and more, which means that we’ll either have to jack up our taxes or cut all of the things that help guys like me. I don’t want to lose my Social Security, Jerry.
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong style="color: #2980b9;">JERRY BROWN:</strong> Mike, you’ve been reading too much Hayek. Isn’t that what steelworkers do in their spare time? But in all seriousness, it’s not about the budget so much as it’s about allocating money properly. Because we’re the world’s reserve currency, okay? We’re the only superpower. If the going ever gets tough, we can press a button, and all of that will fix itself. It’s not a problem at the existential level. But it is a problem to some degree, you’re right. Really, though, stupidity with the money we spend, though, that’s the problem.
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong style="color: #d35400;">MIKE FROM INDIANAPOLIS:</strong> Well, what are we being stupid about? I watched the ABC news report the other night, and they say that ever since the communists fell apart, we’ve been spending a lot less on our military. And that money has been going into paying off the debt, which is what we need to worry about. That doesn’t sound stupid to me.
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong style="color: #2980b9;">JERRY BROWN:</strong> Mike, do you ever wonder why you’re afraid to go to some places downtown in Indianapolis? But you’re not scared to go there if you’ve had a chance to go fly abroad to, I don’t know, let’s say, Belgium? It’s our inequality. This money, how we’re spending it, it’s reinforcing the current country club and not going back to the people. Without radical wealth redistribution, the types of things that FDR was able to do with his taxes, you can’t fix these problems.
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong style="color: #d35400;">MIKE FROM INDIANAPOLIS:</strong> What does that have to do with the budget?
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong style="color: #2980b9;">JERRY BROWN:</strong> I wanna tell you something else, Mike. Everything is about the budget. You can’t do a thing without spending money, just like Newton’s laws. You need force. So when we allocate the budget, we make choices on how to spend and not spend. And our system right now, we’re making poor choices over and over.
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong style="color: #d35400;">MIKE FROM INDIANAPOLIS:</strong> But why should I listen to you and not like, uh, Ron Paul? I have a friend at work who sent me this guy’s freedom report, and it talks about how the debt is what’s causing these inequalities?
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong style="color: #2980b9;">JERRY BROWN:</strong> Well, I’m a credible politician and Ron Paul isn’t.
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong style="color: #d35400;">MIKE FROM INDIANAPOLIS:</strong> Are you? You lost to Bush pretty badly, after all.
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong style="color: #2980b9;">JERRY BROWN:</strong> Yeah, I mean, the oligarchy saw that its golden boy was being threatened, that it stood to lose everything, so I had to go. They really pulled out all the stops there.
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong style="color: #d35400;">MIKE FROM INDIANAPOLIS:</strong> What’s wrong with Bush?
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong style="color: #2980b9;">JERRY BROWN:</strong> Mike? What do you mean what’s wrong with Bush? Do you not listen to the show? I mean, you’re a what, a union member? Do you really think he has your best interests at heart?
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong style="color: #d35400;">MIKE FROM INDIANAPOLIS:</strong> I don’t think he’s such a bad guy, especially when you look at how he’s trying to balance the budget. He even got my vote back a few years ago, and–
						</p>

						<p style="text-align: center; color: #c0392b; font-weight: bold; margin: 20px 0;">
							(Jerry turns off Mike’s voice)
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong style="color: #2980b9;">JERRY BROWN:</strong> Okay, I think we’ve had enough of that. Let’s move on to another caller. Sheryl from Santa Monica.
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong style="color: #d35400;">SHERYL FROM SANTA MONICA:</strong> Hi, Jerry, I just want to say that I miss your time as governor, and that I’ve listened to your show for a while. Anyway, I was just wondering about the balanced budget…

							<p>IRL, Jerry Brown lost pretty badly in 1992. But, when you look closer at the race, some of the early polling made him seem a lot more competitive than it actually turned out to be. So, assuming that he got a few more lucky breaks and that Bush got a few more bad ones, leading to him winning, what would he have looked like in office?</p>

							<p>It all depends on how he changed his campaign style. It’s hard to remember these days, but he was decidedly the outsider candidate during the Democratic primaries, and it wasn't until the convention that he really absorbed himself into what was then the mainstream Democratic structure. It’s hard to say, because we really haven’t had anyone of his particular brand run since, but you probably see a pretty moderate Brown administration, conservative on the economy and trade but moderate to liberal on the stuff that he was talking about promoting like women’s rights and diversity.</p>

							<p>So it was a weird historical moment. At that point, what we’ll call the establishment was backing Bill Clinton at first. The establishment ideals that he really summed up were a very small-l liberalism. It was still mostly supply-side economics, but with more progressive tendencies than Reagan was fighting for, like not completely throwing unions under the bus and focusing on diversity. At the same time, though, trade was sort of up in the air, so even though you had some guys who were 100% part of the establishment like Dick Gephardt who were anti-NAFTA, they were mixed with pro-NAFTA guys like Clinton or Bill Bradley or Al Gore. But a large part of the establishment was just vibe-based: they didn’t want to move beyond Reagan and Bush, just fit somewhere into their reality.</p>

							<p>If Jerry Brown won the presidency, based on what he was campaigning on (though lord knows he could change his mind on a dime), you would’ve seen:</p>
							<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">

							<p>I’ve actually done a bit of research on the Brown campaign (here in California he’s still pretty fondly remembered now that people have had enough time to put him in context), and he probably just does what he did as CA gov. Changes his positions on taxes but ultimately doesn’t try to increase them (might even try a flat tax), definitely passes a balanced budget amendment, and definitely does a lot to fight climate change. Beyond that, it’s hard to say. As governor, he alternated between being his own worst enemy or his own greatest ally, and based on how well he plays Congress, he either cruises to victory in 1996 or he gets wounded in the midterms and just peters out. But yeah, it would be nothing like Gephardt was.</p>

							<p>I agree with what some of the other people are saying, but I’d be really interested to see how Bush is remembered as a one-termer. Today, he’s like an Eisenhower-lite, generally pretty popular but also not super notable legislatively (seriously, their second terms with a strongly Democratic Congress where the country mostly ran itself for four years are like MIRROR IMAGES of each other). With only one term, I’m guessing people think he’s a total loser like they do with Carter.</p>

							<p>Probably not that badly. He loses pretty big (look at how Bush got screwed worse in 1994 than in 1990), but he had a lot of Democrats in Congress as a cushion. I can’t imagine how ANY Democrat would lose it.</p>

							<p>It was a strategic thing. In 1984, the Democrats try running a New Dealer in Mondale and get steamrolled. In 1988, they run Dukakis, who is mostly a New Dealer but is notably more conservative than Mondale in a few ways, and he gets steamrolled. Then, in 1992, they try running Jerry Brown, who has a bit of New Deal in him but is also very “modern,” and he gets steamrolled. So in 1996, Dick Gephardt crosses the Rubicon and says, “I’ve been mostly okay with the drift the party is taking, but it’s clearly not working. If we lose, we lose fighting for old-school principles.” Then, he fixates on what he calls “working man issues,” smashes Clinton and Cuomo, and then gets vindicated against Steve Forbes. That’s basically how we got our system today.</p>

							<p>Thanks for explaining it so well! Feels crazy to imagine someone like Brown or Clinton as president, but it’s so interesting to hear how that happened. I had always just kinda thought of Reagan and Bush as being this weird 16-year blip of conservatism that we moved on from, but it’s interesting to read about the impact that it had on the Democrats at the time.</p>

							<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 3.2em; line-height: 0.85; padding-right: 10px; font-weight: bold; color: #004b8d;">A</span>t the Specter campaign rally last night in Indianapolis, the mood was uncharacteristic of a presidential campaign, even a losing one. Far removed from the freewheeling, maniacal energy of the Brown campaign, or the uncertain march towards destruction of the Dukakis campaign, it instead felt desperate in a way that no other campaign in living memory has ever felt. Even in the fabled flops of presidential lore, such as Goldwater or McGovern, there was a sense of ideological purity, a sense that although their man wasn’t likely to win the White House, he was at least going to authentically represent a movement who had the possibility of a future vindication. Instead, the crowds gathered at the Indiana State Fairgrounds seemed completely aware of the sobering reality that they were heading towards defeat. “I’m not going to sit here and say that Clinton’s going to run away with it, but I will say that I don’t think that Specter is in the best position right now,” said Vivian Jankowski, a 43-year-old accountant who travelled from Noblesville to watch Senator Specter speak. “I think that we just have to get to Election Day and see what happens… who knows, we might see something.”</p>

							<p>If Jankowski seemed unenthusiastic, she was at least an authentic supporter of Specter, saying that she widely agreed with his policy and was proud that he “helped get a grip on” the conservative elements in his party. Such enthusiasm was not shared by other rally goers, such as Michael Kraft of Indianapolis, who “mostly came to hear President Bush speak.” An exceedingly high number of rallygoers listed either Bush or other convention speakers, such as Dan Coats, as primary reasons for their attendance instead of the actual nominee. Specter himself seemed to realize this, giving his standard stump speech in flat, unenthused fashion, receiving a few scattered handfuls of claps occasionally. The speech, which mostly focused on broad, agreeable rhetoric, drew its loudest applause when Specter highlighted his opposition to gun control, pointing to his opposition of the Brady Bill as proof of his gun rights bonafides. Although it cannot be said that many left the rally disappointed, based on how post-rally discussions quickly switched from political matters to generalized small talk.</p>

							<p>The larger question, of course, is why Specter felt the need to campaign in Indiana, a state that wasn’t competitive last election. When reached for comment, a Specter campaign representative pointed out that his stop in Indiana was in between stops in Michigan and Ohio, long considered to be more competitive states. “Regardless of the poll numbers, the Specter campaign is confident of a victory in November,” claimed the representative, “Indiana just represents a geographically convenient location to spread our campaign’s values nationally, well beyond the swing states.” When asked if they thought that Indiana was a swing state this election, the representative declined to answer.</p>

							<p>The wider question at hand is if the Specter campaign can even salvage Indiana as is, with polls showing Clinton consistently leading Specter by anywhere between 2-7 points in the state. The race for the governor’s mansion looks even more difficult for Republicans, with Stephen Goldsmith trailing Frank O’Bannon by 12 points in the latest round of polls. In a reversal from four years ago, when Republicans were able to make inroads into the Democrats’ House majority and maintain a draw in the Senate, most Republican consultants and advisors see preventing Democratic supermajorities in the House and Senate as their main objective, warning that seats previously thought safe, such as South Carolina and Wyoming, may be up for grabs. “The fundamentals were never going to be in favor of us this year, but Specter is having a difficult time winning over our typical base, and it doesn’t seem like Keyes is helping him,” says one consultant granted the privilege to speak anonymously. “Next week, you have Bill Clinton set to campaign in Laramie, Rapid City, and Bismarck, and when absolutely nobody is questioning that move… that’s when you know that things have gotten really tough. At a basic level, Clinton and Graham have very positive favorables, Specter has sub-average favorables, and Keyes has subterranean favorables.”</p>

							<p>When asked if there were any positive signs for the Republicans in the month remaining before the election, another consultant, also granted the privilege to speak anonymously, was somewhat more positive. “In this country, public opinion is very thermostatic. When you have 16 years of the same people in office, people are going to want change, and love him or hate him, Bill Clinton has made himself represent that idea very clearly. Although I’m not going to sit here and tell you that this campaign is in an enviable position, Specter has two debates to reintroduce himself to the nation and prove that he’s just as much of a change candidate, if but a different, less radical type of change. And I think that he can do it.” Among rallygoers, though, such promises of change were decidedly elusive. Sanda Reddick, of Indianapolis, classified herself as a swing voter who had gone for Bush four years ago but was undecided going into the rally. “Honestly, I mainly went out of curiosity, especially because I didn’t really know what Specter stood for.” Upon being asked if Specter had managed to make an effective case for himself, Reddick was very blunt: “No, he did not… things could change, but if the election was held today, I think that I would probably vote for Clinton.”</p>

                  <h4>BREUER:</h4> <li>Good evening, I’m Bill Bonds. Welcome to the first Democratic primary debate. The winner of the primary will go on to face the Republican nominee - who could be anyone. He could be Jim Baker, Jim Baker, or even Jim Baker. On the stage now is Governor Bill Clinton (DARRELL HAMMOND), Governor Mario Cuomo (NORM MCDONALD), Governor Ann Richards (ANA GASTEYER) and against all odds, Senator George Mitchell (MARK MCKINNEY).<li>

                  <h4>MCKINNEY:</h4> <li>I’m just happy to be here!</li>

                  <h4>HANKS:</h4> <li>You have only 10 words left, Senator.</li>

                  <h4>MCKINNEY:</h4> <li>(Smiles, nods and gives a thumbs up.)</li>

                  <h4>BREUER:</h4> <li>Now, onto the real candidates. Governor Clinton, many question your electability with your controversial past and your failure to win the primary last cycle. What would you say to these critics?</li>

                  <h4>HAMMOND:</h4> <li>(Smiles, very, very tightly. Chew a lemon, that sort of face) Vote Jerry Brown again, you morons.</li>

                  <h4>GASTEYER:</h4> <li>See, this is exactly what I’ve been talking about. Who was one of Jerry Brown’s supporters? Women. And who is Governor Clinton calling morons? Women. How long are we going to tolerate this misogyny?</li>

                  <h4>HAMMOND:</h4> <li>Well, jokes on you, because there are more men as registered Democrats.</li>

                  <h4>MCDONALD:</h4> <li>Now, see this is exactly why I ran for office. Governor Clinton is an abrasive, frankly Republican conservative. It’s tragic that he leads the polls – probably vote splitting between me and that slut Richards.</li>

                  <h4>MCKINNEY:</h4> <li>(While slowly tapping at his fingers to count) Mario you… mean. (Smirks and nods.)</li>

                  <h4>BREUER:</h4> <li>That’s 7 words left, Senator. Would you like to beat traffic?</li>

                  <h4>MCKINNEY:</h4> <li>. . . Yes please. Thank you very much Bill. (He sprints off stage)</li>

                  <h4>BREUER:</h4> <li>Now, Governor Cuomo. Many of your critics hold that New York under your watch has become a modern day Sodom and Gamorrah. Wherever you walk, the streets leave you ankle deep in blood, screams of horror reverberate in every corner and there are a reported 20 murders a second.</li>

                  <h4>MCDONALD:</h4> <li>Uh, do you have a question Bill?</li>

                  <h4>BREUER:</h4> <li>(Spends a minute flicking through sheets of paper while pensive. Finally he smiles and looks back up.) Ah, yes. Why have you failed your state?</li>

                  <h4>MCDONALD:</h4> <li>Well, I would have to question that assessment. I’d say the blood only really gets foot deep. But if we want to talk about failing a state on crime, then we need to talk about Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton just recently executed a man named Wyatt Higgens. Now Wyatt, he was a poor little boy who grew up with nothing. When he tried to learn how to read and write, his teachers beat him with sticks. When he tried to seek employment, people sicced hounds on him. Finally, he swallowed his pride and went to the government welfare office to try and get enough support to live, and the office workers there pantsed him and laughed at him for having small genitals. For being nothing more than an innocent victim failed by society, Bill Clinton murdered him. Why? Just because he killed 12 children? Wyatt needed support, not death. The system failed him, and I think the American people won’t vote for a murderer like Bill Clinton!</li>

                  <h4>BREUER:</h4> <li>Strong words. Mr. Clinton, do you have a rebuttal?</li>

                  <h4>HAMMOND:</h4> <li>(Leaning on the podium, he takes a puff of marijuana and blows out a smoke ring) Nope.</li>

                  <h4>HANKS:</h4> <li>I see. Now, Governor Richards, you’ve openly accused many media junkets of being biased against you because of your gender. Do you hold that’s true?</li>

                  <h4>GASTEYER:</h4> <li>Well—</li>

                  <h4>BREUER:</h4> <li>I’m afraid that’s all the time we have for the debate - we look forward to the next debate, which promises to be more civilised. Isn’t that the case?</li>

                  (A panning shot of the three candidates. Richards is wiping a machete, Cuomo is cocking a gun and Clinton swings nunchucks while saying “woooh”)

                  <h4>BREUER:</h4> <li>It’s enough to admit that in hindsight, Jerry Brown wasn’t that bad. At the very least, we can say that LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT’S SATURDAY NIGHT!</li>

					<h1 class="wiki-h1">2008 United States presidential election</h1>
					<div class="wiki-tagline">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</div>

					<div class="wiki-text">
						<p>
							<b>Presidential elections</b> were held in the United States on November 4, 2008. The <span class="wiki-link">Democratic</span> ticket of <span class="wiki-link">Joe Biden</span>, the senior senator from <span class="wiki-link">Delaware</span>, and <span class="wiki-link">Bill Clinton</span>, the junior Senator from <span class="wiki-link">Arkansas</span>, defeated the <span class="wiki-link">Republican</span> ticket of <span class="wiki-link">Mike Huckabee</span>, the governor from Arkansas, and <span class="wiki-link">Donald Rumsfeld</span>, the former secretary of defense under the <span class="wiki-link">Ford administration</span>. This was the first election since <span class="wiki-link">1952</span> in which neither the incumbent president nor vice president was on the ballot.
						</p>

						<p>
							Incumbent Republican President <span class="wiki-link">Jeb Bush</span> was ineligible to pursue a third term due to the term limits established by the <span class="wiki-link">Twenty-second Amendment</span>. Huckabee secured the Republican nomination by March 2008, defeating his main challengers Senator <span class="wiki-link">John McCain</span> and Vice-President <span class="wiki-link">John Danforth</span>, and selected Rumsfeld as his running mate. The Democratic primaries were marked by a crowded field; as well as Biden and Clinton, <span class="wiki-link">John Kerry</span>, <span class="wiki-link">Barack Obama</span> and <span class="wiki-link">Mike Gravel</span> all held leads for a period of time. Biden became the presumed nominee in June, and chose primary rival Clinton to be his running mate.
						</p>

						<p>
							Bush's popularity had significantly declined during his second term, which was attributed to the growing disdain for the <span class="wiki-link">Iraq War</span>, his response to <span class="wiki-link">Hurricane Irene</span> and the <span class="wiki-link">Camp Bucca torture controversy</span>. Despite this, Huckabee chose to campaign closely with Bush, and make frequent media appearances with the President, to try and heal the divide after defeating Danforth. Biden supported the war, but felt as though Bush and Huckabee had flawed approaches on it. Huckabee campaigned on the theme of “A moral government, a small government”, while Biden emphasized his experience. There were some concerns over a <span class="wiki-link">lagging economy</span>, but most pundits agree foreign policy was the most relevant issue of the election.<span class="wiki-cite">[1]</span>

						</div>

						<div style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">

							<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 3.5rem; line-height: 0.8; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 8px; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Georgia', serif;">A</span>t first glance, the question “who runs the White House” should have a very simple answer: the President of the United States, Jerry Brown. And to some extent, that’s true, as like all presidents, Jerry Brown is the center of the universe around which all things revolve. After that, though, how does Brown translate his thoughts and decisions into tangible actions? Who even advises him on these thoughts and decisions? Over 18 months into his presidency, it’s extremely unclear. On paper, at least, Richard Goodwin, Kennedy and LBJ speechwriter-turned political exile-turned comeback kid, works as chief of staff and is the de jure second-in-command, with all sorts of official advisors and speech writers and bureaucrats ranking below him. In reality, it’s more complicated, as exemplified by an incident where Goodwin was infuriated to learn that Pat Caddell, who has no official role in the administration, had changed Brown’s mind on the decision to send troops to intervene in the Somali Civil War after Goodwin had thought that he and Brown had reached a decision.</p>

							<p>Although several individuals working at the White House are assured that Brown is fully in control, nobody can quite agree how the practical chain of command works, with several different parallel power structures being identified. For instance, although the aforementioned Pat Caddell is technically unemployed at the moment, he has moved back to Washington from California and meets with Brown in person at least once every two weeks. Likewise, old Brown friend Jacques Barghazi, who many thought had been neutralized after a scandal centered around his chauvinistic comments briefly threatened to derail Brown’s campaign, is back in a low-key advisory position, often conducting one-on-one meetings with Brown in the Oval Office. But Brown isn’t limited to soliciting the advice of sycophants, either: Gore Vidal, who ran against him for Senate in 1982, had Brown reach out to him after Vidal criticized his position on taxes. Somehow, the two of them patched things up, and they now have a phone call once a week.</p>

							<p>Those looking for answers in Brown’s Cabinet will likely be left disappointed. Faced with a Senate of a vastly different ideology than him, Brown has mostly toed the line with his appointments, settling for technocratic moderates who are good at their job. Dick Riley, Secretary of Education and establishment favorite (many had him tapped as a potential Clinton pick), is the foremost of these technocrats, with Brown (who had threatened to abolish the Department of Education during his campaign) taking keen interest in developing policies to establish what he calls the “best school system in the world,” working more closely with Riley than the other secretaries. However, by the nature of his de facto lower-ranking Cabinet position, Riley often finds himself surpassed by Secretary of State Howard Berman, described by many as the most clever member of the Cabinet and the one who understands Brown the best, who has sacrificed trying to influence Brown on major policy initiatives in a successful effort to get Brown to advocate for a wide variety of less-publicized policies, such as successful efforts to protect whistleblowers. Berman’s opposite is Secretary of Commerce Ralph Nader, a bleeding-heart ideologue who believes that Brown has a once-in-a-generation chance to remake the federal government into being a people-first institution. At Cabinet meetings, not entirely to Brown’s displeasure, Nader’s voice is often the loudest.</p>

							<p>Above all else, the biggest reason that the Brown administration is so dysfunctional is none other than Jerry Brown himself. Although Brown is, by all accounts, an extremely intelligent and hardworking president, he is also blissfully unmoored to the concept of political capital and strategy, letting his ambitions take him wherever he pleases. Early in his term, Brown pushed for large lower-class income cuts while the House was formulating a budget bill and then suddenly completely abandoned this position after being faced with moderate pushback, with his public address the literal next day after the first sign of House resistance revolving entirely around his efforts to diversify the federal judiciary, with no mention of the budget. Perhaps no single accomplishment better reflects this style than Brown’s guidance on 1993’s crime bill. After spending weeks carefully helping shape the bill, Brown suddenly announced that he would veto it unless the amount of new mandatory minimum sentences was slashed by 90% and the bill refused to expand the federal death penalty beyond its existing limits, nearly tanking it entirely before an 11th-hour effort from Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) saved it. Other bills focusing on welfare reform and environmental regulation have been completely abandoned, with Brown resolving to work on them after the midterms.</p>

							<p>At the moment, it’s unclear if anything can restore immediate order to the White House, with Brown saddled with low approval ratings and headed for a large defeat in the midterms, if polling and historical precedent are to be believed. Inside and outside the administration, it is widely believed that come January, there will be a mass executive branch turnaround, with many already plotting their exits. Yet, one close presidential aide who prefers to go unnamed believes that there may yet be room for hope, stating that “the president knows what the situation looks like with Congress, with how he’s perceived publicly, and with the elections. He’s not naive; he’s not stupid. The midterms have already started spurring him into action, and he’s learning to delegate a lot more and to message a lot more publicly. If you give him a chance, he’ll turn it around.” The American people are currently unlikely to agree with that statement, with polls showing Republicans leading Democrats by six points on the generic ballot. Still, according to the same unnamed source, “Jerry is the president. He’s going to do what he wants to do. Either the people are going to acquiesce to him, or he’s going to acquiesce to them, but things will eventually come to a head. Personally, I’m backing the president.”</p>

							<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 3.5em; line-height: 0.8; padding-right: 8px; font-weight: bold;">T</span>hree years later, any conversation with Ross Perot follows a steady, predetermined pattern: as the conversation goes on, the chances of Perot talking about his aborted presidential bid in 1992 reach 100%. Although he initially led both Jerry Brown and George Bush in polling, Perot eventually dropped his candidacy after a sharp decline caused by repeated self-inflicted wounds. At the time, many attributed his dropout to deep hubris, a charge that Perot denied. Now, with three years of perspective, he’s fully aware that responsibility for his flameout lays squarely on his shoulders.</p>

							<p>“What can I say,” laughs Perot, sitting in his office in Plano, Texas, “I was my own worst enemy.”</p>

							<p>Initially, after Brown’s victory over Bush, there was some hope from Perot that Brown would be able to enact the types of systematic changes to Congress that Perot was advocating for. Although Brown’s campaign tacked more towards mainstream Democratic talking points as time went on, he had focused on many of the same issues that Perot had: the need to balance the budget (or at the very least, massively reduce the deficit), the need for a healthy skepticism of NAFTA, and the need for long-entrenched Congress members to be cleared out to reduce corruption. In office, though, Brown has done a substandard job, in Brown’s eyes.</p>

							<p>“He’s gone one for three,” says Perot. “I like the angle that he’s taken on the budget, but he’s moving too slow for my tastes. Then, letting NAFTA get passed, not doing anything about taking care of Congress critters, he’s been woefully inadequate. I’d give him a C-minus: he’s passing and barely holding it together right now, but if anything jumps up, we’re looking at serious failure.”</p>

							<p>Although Perot’s criticism of Brown might lead one to think that he holds the Republicans in higher regard, the opposite is true. For Perot, Republican frontrunners Bob Dole and Lamar Alexander are little better, an “arrogant loudmouth” and a “boring shill” respectively. Though he notes that there are some Republicans who have “a few half-decent ideas,” they are about equal with the Democrats.</p>

							<p>“No doubt, if Jerry Brown is a C-minus, then the Republicans are a straight F. If you’re out there offering no alternative, and that’s the best you can do, the absolute best, then you’re just plain not good enough. I mean, they need to be able to peel off just one Democrat in the Senate and five in the House, but they can’t even do that? Come on.”</p>

							<p>If all sides of Brown’s extremely narrow trifecta and opposition are accounted for as being not up to the challenges of the times, then who does that leave? The answer, of course, is Perot. For now, he remains coy about running for president in 1996, saying that he will “need to have some talks with the family and look at where my businesses are.” But behind the scenes, the machinations of a campaign are slowly and precisely coming together. Ed Rollins, who was co-chair of the 1992 campaign alongside Hamilton Jordan before resigning after accusing Perot of not being suited to be president, has been coaxed back to the fold with the promise that he will have much greater power in the event of a second run (Jordan is nowhere to be seen). Thomas Luce, who organized the massive draft Perot campaign, has promised to orchestrate an even larger operation. Perot has reached a preliminary agreement with Norman Schwarzkopf for the running mate slot.</p>

							<p>If Perot really is to be the next president, though, he will need to not only take responsibility for his past shortcomings on the campaign trail, but will also need to address them and improve. Although Perot makes a show of bristling over needing to “tone himself down,” privately, he has made several promises to Rollins about how a second campaign will be conducted. Among other various pledges, Perot has promised Rollins that he will not make any mention of conspiracies, will take outside donations while spending as much of his own money as necessary to win, and most importantly, will treat running for the presidency as a full-time job, spending the entirety of election season campaigning instead of trying to balance it with his business duties in Dallas.</p>

							<p>Although the road to the White House may be long and treacherous, there is ample reason to think that Perot could win a general election–or at the very least, deadlock it–if he chooses to run. Many voters feel that he left something on the table by dropping out, and are chomping at the bit at a chance for him to redeem himself. In the latest ABC News poll on the 1996 presidential election, Perot led Brown and Dole 38% to 33% and 26%, respectively (the poll found the exact same results when Lamar Alexander was given as the Republican candidate). But for now, Perot’s campaign exists purely in the realm of hypotheticals, even if those hypotheticals are quickly becoming reality.</p>

							<p>“Heck, I could run, I could not run, it’s all on the table,” Perot says to close out his interview. “But one day, my grandchildren are going to get old enough to have a real understanding of politics, and they’re going to ask me where I was when Jerry Brown and his GOP friends were mucking up our government. What am I going to tell them?”</p>

        <p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">Old Perspectives Made New in Tiraspol</p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">New York Times</p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">Ryan Stephens</p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">October 28, 2011</p>
        <p>Vincent Bugliosi’s new biography of Ruslan Stepanenko, one of the most famous men of the modern era, is not the work of a professional historian. Bugliosi, trained as a lawyer, instead frames <i>A Cold Day in Tiraspol</i> as a reframing of the events that we already know about Stepanenko’s life, both laying out the historical record of Stepanenko’s existence while taking aim at the conspiracy theories around George Bush’s assassination. Bugliosi is extremely critical of those who assign any wider conspiracy to Bush’s death, arguing that the Lugar Commission's findings, that Stepanenko planned the assassination with a small group of other Ukrainian ultranationalists, was indeed what had happened.</p>
        <p>Bugliosi is no stranger to having written about the topic of presidential assassinations, with his whopping 1,612-page book <i>Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy</i> having released to generally positive reviews. Here, he repeats the same process that was so successful in that book, slowly breaking down Bush’s death step by step, showing exactly how Stepanenko’s bullet made its way into Bush’s chest, starting as far back as Stepanenko’s childhood in Lvov. Along the way, Bugliosi packs a great deal of criticism for Bush conspiracy theorists, often calling them out by name and ridiculing their findings using colorful language. Although these attacks can get slightly too personal at times, Bugliosi is at his best attacking his opponents, meticulously examining the historical record to establish just why he is right and just why the conspiracy theorists are wrong, with his full list of sources clocking in at 104 pages.</p>
        <p>If the book falters, it is only when Bugliosi attempts to explain the wider geopolitical background of the former state of Transnistria, with his analysis, while competent, often failing to grasp the finer historical details and remaining mostly on the side of mainstream historical narrative. Although his breakdown of the sides of the Transnistria War is adequate, he fails to go fully in depth on Ukraine-Transnistria relations after the war, which ultimately robs the reader of much-needed context of Stepanenko’s ultranationalist background and how it fit into the wider Ukrainian political culture at the time.</p>
        <p>However, Bugliosi’s historical analysis is, ironically, stronger in a few areas than professional historians who have written on the subject. For instance, rather than simply stating that Bush’s handling of relations with Transnistria and Ukraine was formulated as a response to Jerry Brown’s shock visit to Tiraspol during the 1992 presidential election, Bugliosi uses new interview from members of the Brown campaign to dive into the reasons why the former governor chose to visit Tiraspol in the first place, revealing that Brown had also considered both visiting the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and simply holding further meetings in Kiev. Likewise, Bugliosi also uses tapes from the Bush White House that cover conversations held by his advisors on the Transnistria matter, detailing how such a small, meaningless country was able to gain enough importance in the eyes of the White House for an official visit.</p>
        <p>Finally, Bugliosi tells Stepanenko’s personal story in an extremely compelling way, a far cry from the stock assassin that many accounts reduce him to. Rather than solely paint him as a radical, Bugliosi explains how Stepanenko’s rough childhood and the upheaval of the Soviet Union, alongside his Moldovan connections, made him a prime recruitment target for ultranationalists. While Stepanenko is often portrayed as a master schemer with a plan for Ukraine to launch a sneak attack on Transnistria, Bugliosi instead suggests that he was nothing more than an ideologically driven man who was a crack shot with a rifle who simply found himself in the right place at the right time.</p>
        <p>Overall, while Bugliosi breaks little new ground on the Bush assassination, he has neatly assembled much of the current history and literature into a digestible, straightforward tale of violence and political intrigue. Though it is less lengthy of a tome than his previous book on Kennedy, Bugliosi writes much more efficiently, packing new exciting details into every sentence without taking too long to fixate on the irrelevant. While other historians might have published more groundbreaking works on Bush’s life and death, this book is an extremely effective read that approaches Bush and Stepanenko from a new perspective, asking us to consider if what we know really is true after all.</p>`

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Franklin Delano Obrador?</strong></h1> <p>The Christian Science Monitor</p> <p>Danielle Hladik</p> <p>October 3, 2011</p> <p>As Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (commonly abbreviated AMLO) prepares to leave office, the question of who his successor will be is a mere question of who Obrador thinks is best within his own party, a cohesive left-wing coalition name Coalition for the Good of All. Given his sky-high approval ratings, the result is almost certain, as prospective candidates from AMLO's sphere all trounce potential opponents in polling for the 2012 election. Obrador's popularity has transcended political affiliation to the point of gaining folk hero status, with corridos (Mexican narrative folk songs) about him often making their way onto the pop charts.</p> <p>With that in mind, then, it's easy to forget that the path to power for Obrador was not as easy as the results may suggest. Initially a member of Mexico's PRI party, which ruled the country for most of the 20th century, Obrador left in the 1990s amidst a rising wave of left-wing sentiment against NAFTA, the ratification of which Obrador cites as having "radicalized" him. From there, Obrador was elected to lead the Mexican federal district including Mexico City in 2000, receiving high marks for his work and gaining national credibility as a left-wing firebrand who was capable of enacting concrete improvements.</p> <p>In the 2006 election against the conservative politician Santiago Creel, Obrador sought to intentionally cast himself as being an American-style figure in the Mexican political landscape, listing a series of promises explicitly designed to emulate FDR's New Deal while also promising that "drastic change" was coming to the Mexican political system in the first 100 days of his presidency. Although Obrador often harmed his own candidacy with bombastic rhetoric and political stunts, he maintained a polling lead throughout the race, going into election night clearly ahead in the exit polls. While there was a great deal of controversy about the counting of votes and both candidates declared victory, Obrador ultimately assumed the office of the Mexican presidency with a mandate for change.</p> <p>In office, Obrador enacted just that change. In his inaugural address, he declared that Mexico was "done with patronage, done with corruption, done with Quixotic battles against imagined criminals, and ready for humanity." Immediately, he embarked on a massive expansion of the Mexican welfare and regulatory state, creating a European-style social safety net out of thin air. Simultaneously, Obrador declared a massive "War on Corruption," in which he limited government officials' pay and introduced new accountability systems combined with harsh penalties for corrupt officials. These two efforts are primarily seen as being the major factors behind his continued popularity, as the quality of Mexican government services has risen astronomically over the past five years.</p> <p>Interestingly, though, many of Obrador's programs were seemingly lifted straight from FDR, such as an "Infrastructure Renewal Agency" that follows the exact same model as the Civilian Conservation Corps, or the weekly televised addresses he gives which are reminiscent of Roosevelt's fireside chats. Hammering home the comparison, Obrador has extensively collaborated with many noted figures of American liberalism, including Jimmy Carter, Jerry Brown, and Mario Cuomo, seeking their advice on his projects. In turn, Obrador has consistently advocated for Mexican-Americans to elect leaders similar to him, though his efforts on that front have seemingly borne little fruit.</p> <p>As Obrador prepares to make his de jure exit from the Mexican political scene, he will leave office as a man who came into power on a mandate of change, who expanded the Mexican government, who defied expectations by easily winning off-year elections, who steered the country through various crises. As a general rule, Americans pay little attention to Mexican politics, preferring to focus on their own affairs. Right under their noses, an entirely new transformation has been taking place, one that may very well provide a blueprint for future American liberals.</p>

<p><strong>Markus:</strong></p>
<p>Ey Leute, habt ihr eigentlich gesehen, was hier im Viertel abgeht? Überall nur noch polnische Autos, polnische Nummernschilder. Man kommt sich vor wie in einem Vorort von Krakau.</p>
<p><strong>Stefan:</strong></p>
<p>Ja, schlimm. Letztes Mal bei Lidl, nur noch Polnisch um mich herum. Ich verstehe kein Wort mehr, wenn ich einkaufen gehe.</p>
<p><strong>Birgit:</strong></p>
<p>Ach, mir fällt das auch auf! Selbst der kleine Bäcker an der Ecke — da wird nur noch auf Polnisch gequatscht. Und die Preise gehen hoch, aber an der Ordnung mangelt es trotzdem.</p>
<p><strong>Uwe:</strong></p>
<p>Tja, wenn sie ihre Wirtschaft mal auf die Reihe kriegen würden, müssten sie sich hier nicht stapeln. Das zieht sich schon seit Jahrzehnten wie Kaugummi, immer dieselbe Leier.</p>
<p><strong>Markus:</strong></p>
<p>Und das Schlimmste ist, sie kleben überall ihre Zettel an die Laternen: "Suche Arbeit, mache alles billig." Natürlich drücken sie dann die Löhne für alle.</p>
<p><strong>Stefan:</strong></p>
<p>Klar, kommt davon, wenn man alles offen lässt. Früher kannte hier jeder jeden. Jetzt? Man versteht weder die Leute noch ihre Mentalität.</p>
<p><strong>Birgit:</strong></p>
<p>Aber wehe, man sagt was — dann ist man gleich der „Böse" und wird als Rassist abgestempelt.</p>
<p><strong>Uwe:</strong></p>
<p>Na ja, ich sag, wie's ist: Das Viertel kippt. Kultur? Fehlanzeige. Man fühlt sich nicht mehr zu Hause.</p>
<p><strong>Markus:</strong></p>
<p>Ich sag's ja, das ganze System ist kaputt. Die Polen haben's hier in Deutschland nicht wirklich besser. Warum sonst kommen die immer rüber? Wenn ihre eigene Wirtschaft so gut laufen würde, wären sie nicht hier.</p>
<p><strong>Birgit:</strong></p>
<p>Ja, aber das zieht sich doch schon ewig. Sie hätten schon vor Jahren was ändern können. Was war das nochmal mit diesem Walesa? Dieser Idiot hat doch nichts auf die Reihe bekommen. Hat bloß die ganzen Arbeiter verarscht. Und jetzt sind sie alle hier, weil sie's selbst nicht hinbekommen.</p>
<p><strong>Markus:</strong></p>
<p>Ich stimme zu, 100%</p>
<p><strong>Stefan:</strong></p>
<p>Genau, der hat die Leute für seine eigenen politischen Spiele benutzt. Hätte nie gedacht, dass ausgerechnet Polen uns hier in Deutschland Konkurrenz machen. Ich sehe nur, wie sie hier die Sozialkassen belasten und sich dann über uns beschweren.</p>
<p><strong>Uwe:</strong></p>
<p>Tja, und dann wundern sie sich, wenn keiner hier mit ihnen richtig redet. Wie sollen wir die Leute ernst nehmen, wenn sie es nicht mal schaffen, ihr eigenes Land ordentlich zu führen?</p>
<p><strong>Birgit:</strong></p>
<p>Das ist der Punkt! Die Wirtschaftsleistung ist schwach, und die Leute haben trotzdem den Mut, hierher zu kommen und sich alles zu schnappen. Das ist einfach nicht fair gegenüber denen, die hier schon seit Jahren arbeiten und sich was aufgebaut haben.</p>
<p><strong>Markus:</strong></p>
<p>Das Problem ist doch, dass sie sich viel zu schnell anpassen und dann erwarten, dass wir uns an sie anpassen. Früher haben wir immer gesagt, "Polen sind fleißig", aber das ist nicht alles. Man kann die Probleme eines ganzen Landes nicht auf einen Schlag beheben, und jetzt müssen wir das ausbaden.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Travel Vlog: Krakow, Poland</strong></h1>
<p>"So, like, hiiiii everybody. My name is Thierry, spelled T-H-I-E-R-R-Y and I'm just a normal American traveler gal here to show you the ins and outs of a new destination. Now, today, we're gonna talk all about Poland! So, a lot of people might not know this, but back in the day, Poland was, like, kinda ostracized? I don't know much about it from back then, but after the fall of like, communism and stuff in Eastern Europe, Poland was kinda in a rinky-dinky spot. And I'm gonna be so real with you, I don't even know how that was ever, like, a thing, because today it's so nice and there are so many tourists but that's okay because everyone loves it!"</p>
<p>(Shots of Krakow's old town, flooded with tourists)</p>
<p>"And now here's Krakow! It's the second-largest city in the country, but it actually has the most tourists, because the capital, Warsaw, lowkey kinda sucks to be a visitor. I mean, it's okay for like a day and a half, but it's a lot of glass and concrete, you know? Krakow, though, is a magical place, just like you've stepped into a glistening fairy tale. Everywhere you look, you've got castles, palaces, libraries, all of the good stuff you could want out of a perfect European town! Sure beats the hell out of Austin, let me tell ya!"</p>
<p>(Shots of throngs of tourists on Krakow's streets)</p>
<p>"But like, the problem with Krakow is that there are a lot of tourists, and a lot of the time, these people make it really hard to visit. So you can do some stuff where the number of tourists doesn't really matter, like Wawel Hill and the Old Town–you can just kinda push past people a bunch until they move, thank God–and other stuff. But sometimes, it can get a bit crowded. So you have to go off the beaten path. That's why I'm here to help!"</p>
<p>(Aerial shot of the city)</p>
<p>"Now when you go downtown, there's bunches and bunches of people there, all at the churches and the markets and the museums and stuff. A lot of Americans really like the Jerry Brown statue that's on the main square–in Polish, that's REE-NEK GLOV-NEE–and stuff like that. But actually, when you get out a bit, they have some really cool stuff. Like, when you take the bus a bit to get out of the main part of town a little, they have the Kosciuszko Mound. It's really cool and really high up, so you get a fantabulous panorama of all of the city and the surroundings. Say cheese!"</p>
<p>(Shot of the town of Wieliczka)</p>
<p>"Here's another cool part about Krakow. Right outside of it, there's a mine, which is like, 400 years old or something? It's a big salt mine where they've carved out everything for centuries, so there are all sorts of cool statues and carvings and everything else! They even have a church made of salt, if you're into, you know, that whole Catholicism thing. The Pope, the John Paul II guy, he went here a few times back in the day. If you're not, though, but still want to try something really unique, just try licking the walls for a bit, because they are made of real salt!"</p>
<p>(Solemn shots of Auschwitz)</p>
<p>"A lot of the ordinary tourists like to stay in town and visit Oskar Schindler's factory, especially because the movie was shot here–RIP victims of the Holocaust, by the way–but if you want to see more history of World War II, Auschwitz is only a train ride and bus ride away. Just don't miss the train to Auschwitz like I did when I went! Once you're there and have your tours or tickets or whatever it is you've purchased, you can go see how people lived and died. They even take you into the gas chamber, which is, like, really cool but also super sad at the same time? Like, hashtag never forget, am I right?!"</p>
<p>(Shots of nightlife)</p>
<p>"Okay, now onto more fun things! Krakow also has a great nightlife scene, with lots of great bars! A lot of bars try to hop onto the whole Game of Thrones craze, 'cause they, you know, shot some of it here, but those bars are pretty overpriced, even if they're not too bad by American standards. To have a real Krakow experience, you've got to dig deep, really go underground to the party district: Kazimierz. It used to be the Jewish quarter, but, really sadly, since they're kinda gone now, there are a bunch of bars and restaurants there instead which are mostly really good and have a really good vibe! Lots of tourists in some places, but if you go deep enough, you can meet some really strapping Polish boys or some hot Polish girls–I know that I don't discriminate!"</p>
<p>(Overhead shots of the city)</p>
<p>"So yeah, that's just kinda like my short little explanatory video on Krakow and, like, what you can expect there. As always, thank you so much for joining in with me, since it's like, such a pleasure to get to travel to all of these places with your support. In my next episode, catch me as I go take a trip to Kiev, a city which has some really cool stuff! Until later, lovelies!"</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>MILITARY JOURNALISTS KILLED IN SUICIDE BOMBING</strong></h1>
<p>Jana Zakarija, Chicago Tribune</p>
<p>March 9, 2005</p>
<p>In a tragic events that many are comparing to a smaller-scale version of the infamous 1983 Beirut barracks bombing, six military journalists were killed in a suicide bombing at the Al-Asad airbase in Iraq. The base, which many have considered a safe zone during the United States' yearlong occupation of Iraq, had previously come under fire from Iraqi insurgents, but remained unscathed by deadlier attacks. However, according to military sources, an unidentified civilian was able to gain access to the base while secretly wearing a suicide vest, detonating it on accident while a small team of military journalists were conducting an informal interview with him.</p>
<p>The victims (Eric Wilson, James David Hamel, Paul Eddy, Hugh Slackowitz, Gary Lee Boughner, and Cole Hockfield) were part of a unit focused on creating news content for the American armed forces, mainly writing articles and taking photographs, and their death has come as a shock to many. At the moment, the airbase is instituting temporary increased security measures until the policies that led to the breach can be identified. Although violence in Iraq has steadily decreased since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's government, occasional acts of terror have occurred from small-scale Islamist militias.</p>
<p>The victims will be flown back to the U.S., where they will be given military funerals with full honors. American General Petraeus has issued a statement promising that those who assisted with the bombing will be found and prosecuted to the greatest extent possible, while the top Iraqi military commanders have issued similar statements. Given the relative stability that has occurred since the initial aftermath of Hussein's deposal, this attack has taken many by surprise. U.K. Prime Minister Redwood has promised to play a leading role in reevaluating coalition policy towards Iraqi civilians, a move echoed by French President Jospin. The current American administration has yet to offer any comments on coalition policy, though many believe that some minor tweaks are needed.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Rapper Birdman Wins Climate Award</strong></h1>
<p>April 22, 2006</p>
<p>AP News</p>
<p>Helen Hoffman</p>
<p>NEW ORLEANS – Birdman, the acclaimed rapper and executive of Cash Money records, has been given the Climate Awareness reward by the Brown Foundation. In a surprising move, Birdman accepted the award from former President Jerry Brown in person, with Birdman personally thanking him for the decision and calling Brown the "greatest stunna to ever be in the Oval Office, even more so than JFK."</p>
<p>This award is hardly the first of Birdman's illustrious career, of course. Birdman has sold tens of millions of albums and won over a dozen Grammy awards. In 2005, he became the first rapper to win a Pulitzer Prize, an award that was given to him for his "incredibly intricate wordplay and his clearheaded analysis of social issues in the United States." Birdman also serves as the manager and de facto surrogate father of fellow rapper Lil Wayne, who recently scored his first career #1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 with his track "Fireman."</p>
<p>In the past year, though, Birdman has received a slew of positive public attention for his advocacy for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, publicly excoriating embattled Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal for his handling of the storm, the effects of which many perceive as being the result of the state's poor management of levee systems. Since the storm, Birdman has also advocated for stronger reactions to global warming, given the threat that rising sea levels pose to his hometown of New Orleans.</p>
<p>Since his time in office, Brown has been a leading voice on environmental and climate issues, founding the Brown Foundation as an international cooperative nonprofit with former Indian Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao, with whom Brown had a close working relationship as president. Since Rao's death in 2004, Brown has served as the foundation's sole chairman, orchestrating charitable work in communities which have been hit the hardest by climate change. He began issuing the Climate Awareness award in 2002, awarding it to Gaylord Nelson, founder of Earth Day.</p>

<p><strong>Tokyo, December 15, 2007</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ambassador Jeffords</strong></p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me, Mr. Ichikawa. To what do I owe the pleasure of your visit?</p>
<p><strong>Minister of Defense Ichikawa</strong></p>
<p>We need to discuss our cooperation in the Strait of Malacca. There have been some events there recently that desperately threaten our country, and as we all know, whatever threatens Japan threatens the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Jeffords</strong></p>
<p>Of course, Mr. Ichikawa. I just came back from a four-day mini-vacation, so I haven't been updated yet on the situation. Can you fill me in?</p>
<p><strong>Ichikawa</strong></p>
<p>There is a rebel group in Western Indonesia, on the island of Sumatra, which has recently begun a campaign against oil tankers heading from the Persian Gulf to Japan. So far, our attempts to negotiate with the rebels have been a complete failure–they're part of some minority nobody's ever heard of, the Nias. Most are Protestant, but this group is composed of hardline Islamists.</p>
<p><strong>Jeffords</strong></p>
<p>So what's the problem with them? They don't sound very threatening.</p>
<p><strong>Ichikawa</strong></p>
<p>There are two primary issues here. First, although they are small in number, they are zealots, probably because they're such a minority within a minority. You can't get them to listen to reason like you could another group. Second, we have reason to believe that Gadaffi is the one behind them. We have substantial evidence that Gadaffi has been funneling illicit Chinese weapons through Libya so that the Nias can use it.</p>
<p><strong>Jeffords</strong></p>
<p>I see the problem. So what type of damage are they dealing?</p>
<p><strong>Ichikawa</strong></p>
<p>They've been targeting Japanese shipping, and have already sank millions of tons in cargo. So far, we've managed to avoid losing any oil tankers, but they've made attempts to hit them many times. If they succeed in hitting them, it would cause massive disruptions to our economy, as well as creating an environmental catastrophe.</p>
<p><strong>Jeffords</strong></p>
<p>This is highly problematic, highly problematic. Where do we come in?</p>
<p><strong>Ichikawa</strong></p>
<p>Oh, it's very simple. Our Cabinet simply wishes that you send some boats to help escort our tankers through the straits, that you conduct some strikes on the Nias, and that you conduct some strikes on Gadaffi. It's just some routine… pruning.</p>
<p><strong>Jeffords</strong></p>
<p>I'll have to ring up the president, but you already know that he'll say yes.</p>
<p><strong>Ichikawa</strong></p>
<p>I thank you very much, James-san. We in the Cabinet have the utmost belief that your help will help reassure our investors to the extent that they purchase their normal share of U.S. Treasury bills at next Tuesday's auction.</p>
<p><strong>Jeffords</strong></p>
<p>Of course, of course. We'll make sure that Gadaffi gets the message and that the Nias don't have a single bullet left to fire. I'll have someone in the staff put out a message to Tripoli to let them know of the plan.</p>
<p><strong>Ichikawa</strong></p>
<p>That sounds ideal. Should these issues persist, we can always revisit this exchange at a later date, but let us hope that they don't persist, yes? With our cooperation, we can get things back to normal as soon as humanly possible.</p>
<p><strong>Jeffords</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you have my word that it'll happen. After all, superpowers have to stick together, am I right?</p>
<p><strong>Ichikawa</strong></p>
<p>Indeed, James-san. Indeed.</p>

<p><strong>Detroit, March 22, 2001</strong></p>
<p><strong>DUNLEAVY</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to Detroit, Mr. Bennet. I trust that the flight from Boston was comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>BENNET</strong></p>
<p>Oh, nothing that I haven't done a thousand times before. I fear that may be a literal statement.</p>
<p><strong>DUNLEAVY</strong></p>
<p>Hey, you're a shareholder. You have responsibilities that are far, far beyond the scope of anything we could do here.</p>
<p><strong>BENNET</strong> (laughing)</p>
<p>We'll see about that. Kerkorian has been telling me that you've been up to some impressive work here. You'll understand if I'd like to take a first-person look at it, I'm sure.</p>
<p><strong>DUNLEAVY</strong></p>
<p>Of course. I'm not the manager for nothing, after all. Now, if you'll follow me, please.</p>
<p>(The pair walks into the factory floor. Immediately, they're surrounded by a constant blur of motion, of robotic arms pivoting, conveyors gliding shells of future cars down the line, forklifts zipping past with calculated urgency. Every detail of the factory seems structured on the singular goal of making the best car possible)</p>
<p><strong>DUNLEAVY</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Bennet, you're going to want to keep your eyes peeled. What you're seeing right here is what I've been calling Chrysler's next-level production revolution. Frankly, sir, we've out-Toyotaed Toyota. You know their whole spiel. You have kaizen, just-in-time inventory, the lean manufacturing gospel. Well, we took all that, stripped it for parts, and rebuilt it smarter. It's all about computer chips, period. Computer chips–let me tell you about them. What we have here is the world's smartest assembly line. Our version pushes real-time data even deeper into the workflow than anything ever attempted before. Our assembly lines adjust mid-stream based on supplier conditions and dealership sales data. Not weekly reports. Not daily. Hourly.</p>
<p><strong>BENNET</strong> (arched brow, mild interest)</p>
<p>And how's the defect rate holding under this... hourly tinkering?</p>
<p><strong>DUNLEAVY</strong></p>
<p>Cut by 36% since Q4 last year, sir. Our parts rejection rate is so low the suppliers started using our reports to correct their output. It's a closed loop now. Our logistics software makes the Toyota Production System look like an old IBM punch card deck. We call it "Dynamic Flow Optimization." The Japanese haven't seen it coming. Neither has Ford. Neither has GM. And we're patenting the proprietary segments of the software stack before they can reverse-engineer it.</p>
<p>(They pause at a computer station, where a young technician monitors streams of production metrics on a flat-screen monitor)</p>
<p><strong>DUNLEAVY</strong></p>
<p>You see this, sir? This is automated fault detection and predictive downtime modeling. This isn't just factory floor automation. This is us dragging Detroit into the 21st century. Every robotic welder, every torque gun, even every paint sprayer reports status and variance back to central control in real time. If a single unit starts trending out of tolerance, the entire line compensates or flags it before the problem can snowball. That's why uptime is hovering at 98.7% for the quarter.</p>
<p><strong>BENNET</strong></p>
<p>You mentioned last quarter's shareholder call... fuel efficiency targets. How's the shift to hybrids shaping up?</p>
<p><strong>DUNLEAVY</strong></p>
<p>Ah! Right this way, sir.</p>
<p>(He leads Bennet to a quieter alcove, where a line of pre-production vehicles sits under soft white lighting)</p>
<p><strong>DUNLEAVY</strong></p>
<p>What you're looking at are the first hybrids rolling off the line. Not concept cars. Not moonshot experiments. Production models. Sedans. You see, we doubled down where the others hedged. Toyota gave the world the Prius, sure, but we're building American hybrids: larger chassis, lower price, and higher margins. And the Treasury's been writing us love letters for it. Between the federal clean energy subsidies and Michigan's own tax credit initiatives, these hybrids have already booked the company over $1.1 billion in subsidies and credits for the upcoming fiscal year. We have Brown to thank for those, of course, but the new administration has signaled that they want to keep, maybe even expand, these financial measures.</p>
<p>(The pair walk around a bit and look at the hybrids closer)</p>
<p><strong>DUNLEAVY</strong></p>
<p>And the beauty of it? The sedans are selling like hotcakes, even without the hybrid systems. Our V6 and V8 lines are meeting CAFE standards with the normal models, which qualifies them for secondary credits. Then, once we sell those, we can move the higher-margin trucks and SUVs without penalty. It's an act the feds practically paid us to master. And the SUVs, the trucks, our guys are making their fuel efficiency improve practically by the hour. It's become a virtuous cycle.</p>
<p><strong>BENNET</strong></p>
<p>And the long game? Gas prices won't stay flat forever. What happens when, if, we get a redux of 1973?</p>
<p><strong>DUNLEAVY</strong></p>
<p>Right through this door, sir.</p>
<p>(They step into a walled-off design studio with a single car sitting under a gray dust cover. Dunleavy snaps his fingers at an assistant, who whips off the cover, revealing a prototype with clean, unbroken lines, flush door handles, and no visible exhaust.)</p>
<p><strong>DUNLEAVY</strong></p>
<p>We call it the Millenium. Get this: it's all-electric. Zero tailpipe emissions. The range is 220 miles. The target retail price is sub-$30K. Look, we're not betting on the fringe here. We're building an electric vehicle that the average American household can park in the garage without needing to be Bill Gates.</p>
<p><strong>BENNET</strong></p>
<p>Interesting, interesting. But what about the EV1? That was a complete bust.</p>
<p><strong>DUNLEAVY</strong></p>
<p>The EV1 was a glorified prototype that GMC pushed out because of California's bullshit. This is an EV1 that doesn't cost a fortune to produce and doesn't suck. This isn't just a concept; the tooling's already budgeted. We have five of these running in Arizona already without any issues, and we're about to start cold-weather testing. Production starts in 2004 if the board signs off.</p>
<p><strong>BENNET</strong> (walks a slow circle around the car, running his fingers along the seamless bodywork)</p>
<p>What's the margin look like at sub-30?</p>
<p><strong>DUNLEAVY</strong></p>
<p>Break-even at 60,000 units annually, but the regulatory credits alone make it profitable at 40,000. Factor in the PR win, and frankly, the car could be a loss leader and still worth the effort. Imagine it: Chrysler saving the world before the other guys even realize they can save it.</p>
<p><strong>BENNET</strong> (slowly grinning)</p>
<p>You've done your homework, Harold.</p>
<p><strong>DUNLEAVY</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Bennet, Chrysler isn't playing catch-up anymore. We're setting the pace.</p>
<p>(The pair walk out of the factory as the hum of industry fills the air)</p>`

       <h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Jack Layton Sworn In As Prime Minister of Canada</strong></h1>
<p>OTTAWA — Jack Layton, the leader of the New Democratic Party, was sworn in as prime minister of Canada on Wednesday morning, ending nearly a decade of Conservative dominance.</p>
<p>Mr. Layton and his new cabinet took the oath of office at Rideau Hall, the official residence of the country's governor general, David Johnston. They arrived shortly after Jim Prentice, the departing prime minister, tendered his resignation.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnston, as Queen Elizabeth II's representative, fulfills most of the duties of head of state here, including administering the oath of office to government ministers. Although the swearing-in ceremony is less dramatic than, say, that of the American president, it is still a serious occasion.</p>
<p>The swearing-in ceremony took place inside Rideau Hall in front of a small invited audience. Mr. Layton had originally planned to open the public onto the grounds of the residence, but unexpectedly cold November Ottawa weather forced him to cancel these plans. Instead, Mr. Layton organized an indoor watch party at Ottawa's 8,500-seat TD Place Arena.</p>
<p>The celebratory and enthusiastic crowd in the arena cheered Layton on wildly, with Layton paying them a visit after his swearing-in, in an event filled with countless smiles, photo ops, and selfies. This approach contrasted markedly with Mr. Prentice, who swore off such public events after fundraising controversies earlier in his career.</p>
<p>"It's been a long time since you've heard a crowd cheering that way in Ottawa for something other than a sports team," said Ian Bourne, one of the many spectators who said they hoped that Mr. Layton, the first Canadian Prime Minister from the New Democratic Party, will change how Canada is governed. "It's a very different feel."</p>
<p>A friend, Jean-Marie Desharnais, added, "It's been a bad 10 years, I think, for a lot of Canadians, it's been very divisive."</p>
<p>The composition of the new cabinet was revealed at the ceremony. As Mr. Layton promised during the election campaign, half of the 30-person cabinet was female, and every province and territory was represented with at least one cabinet minister.</p>
<p>The new cabinet mostly features rookie politicians in several key positions, including the ministries of finance, justice and the environment, although many cabinet picks have substantial experience in provincial government.</p>
<p>In remarks after the ceremony, Mr. Layton said he had appointed "a cabinet that looks like Canada." He also said repeatedly that his government would abandon the highly decentralized approach favored by Mr. Prentice, who often delegated authority to his ministers at the cost of slow governmental action.</p>
<p>"There is going to be a period of great adjustment in the political world in Canada, because the Prime Minister is going to be taking the forefront more often," Mr. Layton said.</p>
<p>Mr. Layton and his ministers will have little time to adjust to their new roles. Parliament will return on Dec. 3. And before then, Mr. Layton, with some of his ministers, will attend four international meetings.</p>
<p>The most challenging will be the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. While Mr. Layton has promised to reverse the Conservative government's approach to that issue, which included Canada's withdrawal from the Kyoto climate change accord, he has offered no specifics. That's largely because any action will first require reaching agreement with Canada's 10 provinces, a daunting task despite his majority government and high popularity.</p>
<p>The government also faces some pressing business left by Mr. Prentice. A Supreme Court ruling earlier this year ordered the establishment of a legal and medical system for physician-assisted death by February, but the Conservatives had moved very slowly on the issue. Likewise, Mr. Layton has promised that reform of Canada's universal healthcare will be his first major legislative push in office.</p>
<p>Mr. Layton has expressed joy about living in the smaller city of Ottawa after spending most of his adulthood in the metropolis of Toronto. Yet he and his wife, Olivia Chow, a member of parliament will not be moving immediately into the official prime minister's residence overlooking the Ottawa River at 24 Sussex Drive.</p>
<p>The 34-room mansion, built in the 19th century for a lumber baron, fell into disrepair long ago. It is poorly cooled in the summer by window air-conditioners; its 50-year-old electrical wiring is strained to the limit; the plumbing is inadequate; and there is asbestos behind some walls and ceilings that needs to be removed.</p>
<p>A 2008 report by the Canadian auditor general called for immediate and extensive renovations, after finding that, except for the roof, the building was "in poor or critical condition." Yet Mr. Prentice, like several predecessors, refused to call in contractors, apparently concerned that the public would disapprove of spending millions of tax dollars on the mansion.</p>
<p>The work will now be undertaken but probably not completed for two years. In the meantime, Mr. Layton and his family will live in Rideau Cottage, a building on the grounds of Rideau Hall.</p>
<p>It also dates from the 19th century, but unlike 24 Sussex, it was recently modernized.</p>
<p>Since his election loss, Mr. Prentice has avoided public events and news conferences whenever he could, and he kept that up right to the end.</p>
<p>Some camera crews positioned near an entrance to Rideau Hall on Wednesday were told to move away and were prevented from recording Mr. Prentice's arrival to perform his final act as prime minister: his resignation.</p>`

Harold, I know that getting this project to the big screen has been hell, a decade-long-project, but this thing we made was all because of you and your dedication. You're one of a kind.

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>BROWN & DI! SECRET WHITE HOUSE ROMANCE EXPOSED!</strong></h1> <p>NATIONAL ENQUIRER</p> <p>APRIL 13, 1998</p> <p>By Dunston Hodges, Senior Correspondent</p> <p>WASHINGTON, D.C. – It's the love story that has rocked the White House!</p> <p>Forget everything you thought you knew about President Jerry Brown's love life, because THE ENQUIRER CAN NOW CONFIRM that the 42nd President of the United States is in a clandestine romance with none other than Diana, Princess of Wales!</p> <p>That's right, America's most eligible bachelor and the world's most famous royal divorcee have been carrying on a top-secret transatlantic love affair that has seen late-night White House rendezvous, sneaky Camp David weekends, and an Oval Office romance straight out of the days of Kennedy's Camelot.</p> <p>Sources deep within the White House—and we do mean deep—have confirmed to The Enquirer that the People's Princess and the People's President have been meeting under the cover of darkness, avoiding the prying eyes of the press while forging what some insiders are calling "a love for the ages."</p> <p>THE ROMANCE THAT NO ONE SAW COMING!</p> <p>Just last year, we at The Enquirer speculated that Brown might have been involved with Venezuelan beauty queen-turned-politician Irene Sáez. At the time, anonymous whispers from within the Beltway hinted that Brown and the former Miss Universe were exchanging a lot more than just diplomatic pleasantries, as the two have been in regular contact since they first met in 1992. However, we can now admit: WE GOT IT WRONG! Our apologies to Ms. Sáez, who remains simply an admirer of Brown's "political asceticism."</p> <p>But Diana? THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY.</p> <p>SNEAKY VISITS & SECRET GETAWAYS!</p> <p>Our White House insiders report that since her tragic 1996 divorce from Prince Charles, Diana has been a frequent, though elusive, visitor to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.</p> <p>"Diana has been flown in on private jets, usually landing at Andrews Air Force Base in the dead of night," says a top-level source, speaking strictly under condition of anonymity. "She has a well-rehearsed routine. They take her to the White House in unmarked black cars, straight inside the gates. If you don't know what to look for, you'd never suspect a thing."</p> <p>But we do. And here's what else we know: Diana and Brown have shared secret weekends at Camp David, where they've enjoyed long walks, private dinners, and moonlit dances beneath the stars. According to confidential sources, Brown has said that she may be "the one!"</p> <p>WHY DIANA? WHY NOW?</p> <p>Some political analysts suggest that this romance makes perfect sense. Brown, the defiant intellectual, has long sought a partner who is equally independent, charismatic, and intelligent. Diana fits the bill perfectly.</p> <p>"She's the only woman alive who could understand the pressures of his position," says political relationship expert Dr. Elaine Norwood. "She has lived through the tabloids, the scandals, the intense scrutiny. She's walked that lonely path of power, just as Brown has."</p> <p>And let's not forget: Jerry Brown has never married. Although he's had many relationships with famous women, including Linda Rondstadt, Brown has remained steadfastly single—until now?</p> <p>PALACE PANIC!</p> <p>For now, Buckingham Palace is SILENT.</p> <p>Though The Enquirer reached out for comment, the Palace remains tight-lipped about Diana's alleged new American romance. However, sources within the royal family suggest that Prince Charles is FURIOUS over the possibility that his ex-wife might end up in the arms of the leader of the free world.</p> <p>"Charles always had a superiority complex," said a former royal insider. "Can you imagine how he'd feel if Diana were to become the First Lady of the United States? He'd have a fit."</p> <p>Indeed, speculation is already swirling about whether Brown and Diana will make their love public—and what that could mean for the American political scene.</p> <p>A WEDDING IN THE WEST WING?!</p> <p>Some insiders have gone so far as to speculate about a possible engagement!</p> <p>"Diana has always wanted to find true love on her own terms," says longtime friend Olivia Carlington. "If Jerry is that man, who's to say they won't make it official?"</p> <p>Imagine the scene: Diana in white, walking down the aisle of the White House Rose Garden, while Jerry Brown—the most unlikely of all Presidents—finally takes the plunge into marriage.</p> <p>Could America's most mysterious Bachelor-in-Chief finally settle down? Could Diana, the woman who defied the monarchy, become America's First Lady?</p> <p>Stay tuned, readers. Because if this love affair continues to heat up, the White House may soon need to plan a royal wedding!</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Moscow's Royal Wedding</strong></h1>

<p>Autostraddle</p>
<p>Autumn Hoerner</p>
<p>March 9, 2008</p>
<p>On March 8, the white, blue, and red of the Russian flag was mixed with the colors of the rainbow as the city's gay citizens celebrated the marriage of Lena Katina and Yulia Volkova, the two members of popular group t.A.T.u. Katina and Volkova married in a private ceremony held inside a private event space on Arbat street. After the wedding, the two women briefly appeared in front of their fans before heading to a downtown restaurant for their reception.</p>
<p>The women's marriage comes four months after Russia's Supreme Court issued a bombshell decision on same-sex marriage, ruling that by the text of Russia's 1993 constitution, same-sex couples had the right to marriage. Although a slight majority of Russians disapprove of this decision (polling has indicated that about 55% of Russians disapprove of same-sex marriage), public backlash has not stopped thousands of couples from wedding.</p>
<p>Katina and Volkova attracted both widespread fame and criticism after the smash success of their 2002 album 200 km/h in the Wrong Lane, anchored by the global hit "All the Things She Said." At the time, the two women were accused of playing up a lesbian relationship for the press as part of a popularity gimmick, with Volkova's 2004 pregnancy seen as evidence that the pair were deceiving the public. The group publicly apologized, stating that the nature of their relationship was personal, and promising to scale down the open displays of lesbianism–a promise they would soon break.</p>
<p>Despite the backlash, t.A.T.u. has remained extremely popular since their victory at Eurovision 2003, with their 2007 North American tour shattering ticket sales records for Russian artists. During the tour, while performing at a show in Minneapolis, the two announced that they were dating, stating that the romantic attraction between them was not part of any stage routine. Katina and Volkova announced their engagement immediately after the Russian court ruling, scheduling their wedding to coincide with International Women's Day.</p>
<p>Katina and Volkova opted for a lesbian spin on a traditional Russian Orthodox ceremony, with both women wearing white dresses and bridal veils. Although the formal ceremony was closed to the public, the pair released their itinerary well in advance so that well-wishers could see the married couple for the first time. Outside of the venue, an estimated 5,000 fans waited on the women, greeting them with a hearty cheer as they walked down Arbat street. The fans, who were overwhelmingly female, waved rainbow LGBT flags and sang t.A.T.u.'s songs while they waited, with many women intermittently kissing each other to repeated rounds of applause.</p>
<p>While Russian society remains culturally conservative, the country's consistent economic progression has seemingly been matched by social progression. Even in homophobic areas of Russia, t.A.T.u.'s romance has attracted a massive amount of overwhelmingly positive media interest, with some Russian journalists comparing the public hype around their wedding to the Russian Empire's old traditions of grand royal weddings. One popular joke goes "In the time of the empire, we had a tsar, tsaritsa, and no money. Now, we've traded the marriage for two tsaritsas, but we have money!"</p>
<p>Among the throngs of people gathered to watch the women walk down Arbat street, it was impossible to find anyone remotely questioning their right to marry. While a protest of Neo-Nazis attempted to organize in opposition to the wedding, it was sparsely attended and dissipated before the wedding had even started. Otherwise, t.A.T.u.s' fans were in high spirits. As one onlooker, Natalya, put it, "In the end, it's not very relevant who gets married. I may marry a man; I may marry a woman. Love is the only thing that matters."</p>`

    <h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE 2004 UKRAINIAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: TIMELINE OF EVENTS</strong></h1>
<p>1999– After years of extreme economic unrest under president Leonid Kravchuk, pro-Russian candidate Nataliya Vitrenko defeats former communist-turned-Europhile Vitaliy Masol in Ukraine's presidential election. Although there is much anxiety over Vitrenko's victory, responses are mostly muted.</p>
<p>2000– President Vitrenko signs a historic gas deal with Russia, with Russia lowering the cost of gas and forgiving all Ukrainian gas debt in exchange for extending the Russian Black Sea Fleet's lease in Sevastopol until 2035 and selling Russia several former Soviet ships and weapons systems. This deal sparks a round of widespread protests in Ukraine which are put down violently.</p>
<p>2000-2004– President Vitrenko embarks on a campaign against independent Ukrainian news outlets. Most notably, Ukrainska Pravda is shuttered in 2002 and the Kyiv Post and Expres are shuttered in 2003.</p>
<p>2002– In Ukraine's parliamentary elections, opposition leader Viktor Yuschenko's party wins the highest number of votes in Ukraine's parliament and initially seems likely to form a majority with Leonid Kuchma's bloc. However, a coalition headed by the Vitrenko-supporting United Ukraine party is able to gain a parliamentary majority after negotiations.</p>
<p>March 2003– President Vitrenko announces that Ukraine will not join the Iraq War's coalition of the willing, inviting widespread criticism from the opposition.</p>
<p>April 2004– Voters overwhelmingly approve a new Ukrainian constitutional amendment strengthening the powers of the presidency greatly despite low polling numbers. Protests erupt and continue for months, eventually petering out in November after parliament refuses to approve the changes.</p>
<p>November 2003– With the constitutional referendum stalled, President Vitrenko announces that she will pause on enforcing the referendum until after her prospective re-election.</p>
<p>March 2004– Russian president Nikolai Patrushev wins re-election in a landslide, with President Vitrenko inviting him to Kiev three days after the election and toasting to future unity between Russians and Ukrainians.</p>
<p>July 2004– Yuschenko announces a widely-expected presidential run as the head of a wide coalition, promising to appoint socialist Oleksandr Moroz as his prime minister after former coalition member Yulia Tymoshenko exits Yuschenko's opposition, citing irreconcilable political philosophy.</p>
<p>September 2004– Yuschenko is poisoned with dioxin, succumbing in an Austrian clinic three days after reporting feeling ill. International suspicion falls on either Vitrenko or Patrushchev as having poisoned Yuschenko, but no one is certain. The opposition decides on former 1994 candidate Leonid Kuchma as a replacement.</p>
<p>October 2004– Kuchma surges into the polling lead on a campaign based around honoring Yuschenko's memory; he wins a plurality of the presidential vote on the first round of elections, but is unable to gain a majority, advancing to a runoff with Vitrenko.</p>
<p>Early November 2004– Aided by alleged Russian money, Vitrenko launches a massive information campaign promising the end of a united Ukraine if Kuchma wins the election, casting doubt on his inconsistent background.</p>
<p>Late November 2004– Vitrenko wins re-election with 53% of the vote in the second round of elections. Exit polls unanimously show Kuchma ahead, prompting claims of election fraud. Massive protests erupt across the country as Kuchma is ceremonially sworn in as president in Kiev's Maidan Square in front of a crowd of 400,000 people. The electoral commission certifies Vitrenko's victory nonetheless.</p>
<p>December 1, 2004– Ukraine's parliament issues a resolution condemning the election. A case disputing the results makes its way to Ukraine's Supreme Court, appearing certain to nullify the results.</p>
<p>December 2, 2004– Due to protests, Vitrenko declares martial law, arresting many opposition leaders and the justices of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>December 3, 2004– Protestors become increasingly violent, seizing control of Lviv oblast and kidnapping several pro-Vitrenko figures.</p>
<p>December 8, 2004– After policemen refuse to fire on them, protestors seize Kiev city hall and the presidential palace, causing President Vitrenko to flee to the Ministry of Defence building. Vitrenko announces that the country is engaged in civil war.</p>
<p>Early December 9, 2004– President Vitrenko appeals to the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CTSO), a military alliance de facto headed by Russia, for military intervention</p>
<p>Late December 9, 2004– Russian airborne forces take control of Kiev's Boryspil International Airport</p>
<p>December 10, 2004– Three brigades of Russian special forces recapture the major government centers of Kiev, killing dozens of civilians</p>
<p>December 11, 2004– President Vitrenko convenes a special session of parliament, where an emergency enabling act allowing for temporary extreme executive powers is passed and the rights of protesters are suspended.</p>
<p>December 12 2004-January 2005– Across Ukraine, protests are violently put down, and several key opposition figures, including Kuchma and Moroz.</p>
<p>January 15, 2005– President Vitrenko is officially inaugurated as president. Russian President Patrushchev and Belarusian President Lukashenko are guests of honor at the ceremony.</p>
<p>February 2005– Parliament, headed by Vitrenko loyalist Viktor Medvedchuk, passes a law calling for the indefinite suspension of Vitrenko's emergency powers. Protests again erupt in Kiev, numbering thousands of people, but are quickly and efficiently put down.</p>
<p>September 2005– Ukraine officially joins the CTSO. There are no major protests.</p>
<p>January 2006– In the Economist's Democracy Index, Ukraine is downgraded from a flawed democracy to a hybrid regime.</p>
<p>March 2006– Vitrenko's United Ukraine party, as part of a bloc with Yulia Tymoshenko, wins a supermajority in Ukraine's parliamentary elections, allowing Vitrenko to pass essentially whatever legislation she might like. International observers decry the elections as free but unfair. There are no major protests.</p>

     <h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Moscow Marks Victory Day with NATO Allies in Historic Celebration</strong></h1>
<p>May 9, 2010 | AP News</p>
<p>MOSCOW (AP) — Red Square became the stage for an unprecedented display of unity and military might today as Russia commemorated the 65th Victory Day with an added milestone: the 10th anniversary of its official membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).</p>
<p>Under the gaze of President Boris Nemtsov and NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, the Victory Day parade, commemorating the date of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, showcased a fusion of Russia's military heritage and its increasingly prominent role in the Western-led security pact.</p>
<p>Soldiers from the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Poland marched alongside their Russian counterparts through Red Square, a scene unthinkable just two decades ago.</p>
<p>"This is a day of remembrance, but also of unity," President Nemtsov said in his address. "Together, we honor the sacrifices of our ancestors, who died so that we may live in a free world. But today, we also recognize the unity that has brought our friends and allies to our great capital, and the strength that lies in our unbreakable bond."</p>
<p>U.S. President Wesley Clark, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz were among the most high-profile Western leaders in attendance, marking the first time that a U.S. president has attended the Victory Day parade.</p>
<p>Although non-Russian NATO ground forces had previously taken part in the Victory Day celebrations, for the first time, a unified NATO force conducted a ceremonial flyover over Red Square, with American, German, and Russian planes coordinating to release colored smoke in the pattern of the Russian flag.</p>
<p>The occasion capped a remarkable transformation in Russia's global alignment. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia's NATO membership was first seriously championed in the mid-1990s by then-U.S. President Jerry Brown, whose administration saw Moscow's inclusion as a stabilizing force for Europe and Asia and a symbol of unity after the end of the Cold War.</p>
<p>After years of diplomatic negotiations, Russia was officially admitted to NATO in 2000 alongside Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia.</p>
<p>Despite initial skepticism from both Western and Russian hardliners, the partnership has survived policy disagreements, economic fluctuations, and global crises, evolving into what many now call "a necessary coalition for the modern era."</p>
<p>While some within Russia still question the country's membership in NATO, public opinion has largely shifted in favor of the alliance, with membership having polled at over 60% approval since 2001, when NATO troops were deployed in the North Caucasus to counter local terrorist groups.</p>
<p>"There were doubts in the beginning," said retired Russian defense minister Igor Rodionov, "but now we see the benefits–our security is stronger, and we have a real say in global decisions."</p>
<p>Despite the celebratory tone of the day, some challenges remain. Although NATO deployment in the Caucasus has ceased, questions still remain about when the alliance will leave Afghanistan, with Nemtsov publicly pushing Clark to begin negotiations in late 2009.</p>
<p>In addition, many in China see Russia's membership in NATO as being a threat to Chinese sovereignty, with the Chinese Communist Party having issued hundreds of warnings against NATO's presence on the Chinese border.</p>
<p>However, as Red Square echoed with the cheers of Russian and NATO troops alike, events underscored a remarkable geopolitical shift.</p>
<p>"A decade ago, seeing Western troops march through Red Square in peace could never have happened," says political scientist Ekaterina Markova, a tenured professor at Moscow State University, Russia's most prestigious higher education institution. "Now, Russia and the West are not two separate entities like we used to be. We are one and the same."</p>

        <p>MOONBEAM 92 ATTEMPTED BROWN MURDER ENDING</p>
<p>Court of Naples, November 29th 2015.</p>
<p>Reporters flock around the court like vultures waiting for their next meal. Some are socializing, some are double-checking their equipment, most are silent.</p>
<p>The silence is then broken first by a black Audi Q8 rounding the corner, and afterwards by the exclamation of a hawk-sighted paparazzi.</p>
<p>"<i>Eccolo!</i>"</p>
<p>In an instant, hundreds of camera flashes fill the air followed by their accompanying noise. The Audi parks in the courtroom's parking lot, and from the backseat exits former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, escorted by two Carabinieri, followed by his lawyer. As they walk deeper inside the courtroom, the uproar of the people outside becomes quieter and quieter.</p>
<p>As Berlusconi is sat in the defendant's spot, the Judge enters the room.</p>
<p>Bailiff: "All rise."</p>
<p>(A symphony of chairs scraping against the room's floor begins playing)</p>
<p>Judge: "<i>Seduti.</i>"</p>
<p>(The symphony is played again)</p>
<p>"Greetings gentlemen. We have been summoned here today, by the chief prosecutor, to reflect upon the case of our former prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi."</p>
<p>(The judge cleans his glasses, then puts them back on)</p>
<p>"Prosecutor, would you like to tell us why you pressed this hard for the court to re-convene?"</p>
<p>(The heads in the room all turn towards the prosecutor except for Berlusconi's: he seems to be in a sort of trance.)</p>
<p>"Yes, your honour." - the man begins with his opening statement - "members of the court, as you all know, the case made against former prime minister Berlusconi is about alleged corruption charges. The first charges were made in 2008, but proceedings stalled last year due to a lack of evidence."</p>
<p>(The chief prosecutor has all eyes on him)</p>
<p>"However, I recently came in contact with a crucial piece of evidence! One that irrefutably ties the defendant, Mr. Berlusconi, to organized crime."</p>
<p>(He pulls out what looks to be a 90s tape; murmurs begin to fill the room)</p>
<p>"Order!"</p>
<p>(The room quiets down)</p>
<p>"Bailiff! Get the court's VCR player!"</p>
<p>(The VCR's mice-like wheels gradually become louder, announcing its arrival in the room.)</p>
<p>(The prosecutor puts the tape in the player, then presses start)</p>

<p>=====================================</p>

<p>(A distorted Mickey Mouse intro plays. After the intro is over, we are presented with two men wearing masks in front of an Amiga 500; one of them has a Mickey mask and the other a robotic one.)</p>
<p>Mickey: "I'm Mickey, he's the Man of Steel, and today we will be giving a demonstration of hacking a data bank containing information regarding national security."</p>
<p>M: "It's one of the major data banks as far as relationships between the Italian goverment and its agencies are concerned - it also seems to function as a sort of chatroom for goverment agents."</p>
<p>(An alternative camera feed shows the audience a close-up of the Amiga's screen. A sequence of seemingly random words start filling the screen from the top.)</p>
<p>M: "Here we have the goverment's directives. From Rome, they are transmitted towards federal buildings all throughout the peninsula - think military bases and the <i>Carabinieri</i>'s barracks. These orders are encrypted to make sure no random shmuck can access them. Me and the Man of Steel, however, are no two shmucks."</p>
<p>(One particular code string seems to catch Mickey's attention)</p>
<p>M: "Let's try and translate this one."</p>
<p>(The Man of Steel begins decrypting the code on his own, smaller machine. The output is slowly transmitted to Mickey's Amiga, whose screen appears to flicker for a second)</p>
<p>M: "The codes are currently being translated... uh, I think there may be some interference."</p>
<p>(The Man of Steel keeps decrypting)</p>
<p>M (reading the translation): "... Jerry Brown... Visit... this seems to be a complete report of Brown's upcoming visit to Naples."</p>
<p>(Mickey checks the message's destination)</p>
<p>M: "The message was only broadcast to a few select agencies... the report that the Campanian ones received is much more detailed than the one forwarded to the American secret services... let's keep translating it, see what we find."</p>
<p>M: "It even has a precise account of which route the presidential motorcade will take, it even keeps track of which guards will accompany him on the tr-"</p>
<p>(The screen flickers some more, the output suddenly stops for a few seconds)</p>
<p>M: "Wait... I think they may be tracing us."</p>
<p>(The output stops again, this time for longer)</p>
<p>M: "They're tracing us! <i>Stacca, stacca!</i>"</p>
<p>(The Man of Steel unplugs the computers' power source. The video goes dark.)</p>

<p>================================</p>

<p>(Suddenly, Berlusconi’s voice rings out across the courtroom)</p>
<p>“You're all the same! Damn you! Damn you all to hell!”</p>
<p>“Mr. Berlusconi! Quiet down!”</p>
<p>(Berlusconi’s lawyer tries to get him to sit down; Berlusconi promptly ignores him)</p>
<p>“How on earth did the prosecution find that footage? How do we know it wasn't faked?!”</p>
<p>“Mr. Berlusconi, I will not ask again. Sit down!”</p>
<p>(A group of guards start making their way over to him)</p>
<p>“This is a witch-hunt! I served the country in the best ways I could, in both the public and private sectors!”</p>
<p>(A group of 5 guards struggles to get the businessman to sit down, as a general aura of chaos seems to fill the room)</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, we can all support that. But right now we're in the court of Naples and you stand accused of sixteen counts of corruption and conspiracy against the state! Now quiet down or I will not hesitate to hold you in contempt of court!”</p>
<p>(Berlusconi sees the light. As if his soul left his body, he goes limp on his little ragged chair. This seemingly stops the bickering.)</p>
<p>“Very well then, we shall carry on with our duties. Defense, you may make your case… but keep in mind to have your client behave!”</p>

        <p>Masters of Death: Inside the Brown-Clark Partnership</p>
<p>Andrew Chowlowski, the New Republic March 3, 2000</p>
<p>Speaking at a news conference during the bombing of Yugoslavia, President Jerry Brown issued a quote that has seemingly defined his policy on international relations: “We cannot have an international relations structure in which the United States is simultaneously expected to lead while also never raising its fist... this is what the whole Kosovo thing is all about.” Indeed, after a post-Cold War lull and massive cuts in the defense budget, the United States seems to be resurgent, intent on making sure no one questions its credentials as the only superpower on the world stage. The costs of the United States holding such power is measured in the thousands of lives lost around the globe, most notably in Yugoslavia but in locales from Sudan to Afghanistan to Columbia to Chechnya.</p>
<p>But first, Yugoslavia, where the bulk of American victims are located. It is impossible to tell the story of the bombing of Yugoslavia without focusing on two men. The first man is, of course, President Jerry Brown, who swept into office as an outsider who was decidedly uninterested in foreign relations, instead utilizing a much more kitchen table-focused populist message. In office, this populism has brought great change to the nature of the presidency, but has impacted the form of the government much less, with Brown’s tendency to move quickly from one issue to the next amassing him a large amount of small victories while simultaneously preventing sweeping structural reforms as accomplished by LBJ or Reagan. Starting early in his second term at a January 1998 press conference, Brown publicly announced that “I have either completed most of my goals that I set out to complete or begun the process of seeing the others to completion.” Although many assumed that this was simply rhetorical flair, it has become increasingly clear that these words instead represented a real, tangible shift to a presidency focusing much more on the international scene after having previously neglected it.</p>
<p>In his first term in office, Brown preached a lower-involvement version of foreign policy to mark a post-Cold War era, and largely followed through with it, controversially refusing to commit large numbers of troops to Somalia and famously waffling on sending troops into Haiti until public pressure from members of his own party, especially Jimmy Carter, forced his hand. Likewise, his initial approach to the Bosnian War was extremely intensive from a diplomatic standpoint, having visited the area in his 1992 campaign, but again decidedly light on bombing. However, heading into his second term, a power vacuum was emerging behind the scenes. U.S. Secretary of Defense Claiborne Pell, inching ever-closer to his 80s, became increasingly hands-off in his approach. Likewise, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman John Shalikashvili, a pick that Brown had made to be broadly appealing, was on his way out, and Brown found himself to be personally distasteful of his replacement, Joseph Ralston. This brings us to the second man: General Wesley Clark, who had</p>
<p>gained a reputation as a brilliant man who didn’t always work well with others, but Shalikashvili saw something in him and introduced him to President Brown. By all accounts, it was platonic love at first sight, and Brown lobbied hard for Clark to be appointed SACEUR, granting him command of NATO forces in Europe.</p>
<p>In 1998, things changed drastically. Shalikashvili was out of the picture and replaced by Ralston, who was hit with allegations that he had engaged in an extramarital affair, destroying any remaining goodwill he had with Brown. With Pell essentially out of the picture, Brown found himself calling Clark more and more, with Clark eventually becoming his de facto top man on all military matters, and the two building a symbiotic partnership. The results of this partnership soon became clear in Kosovo, where Brown skipped any sort of diplomatic action and oversaw a ruthless bombing campaign marked by a seeming lack of care for civilian casualties, stopping an ethnic cleansing campaign at the cost of thousands of innocent lives lost. Likewise, after Russian troops tried to intervene and assume status as peacekeepers in Kosovo, seizing Pristina Airport, Brown gave Clark express permission to overpower them, blocking them off completely and forcing a withdrawal.</p>
<p>The success of operations in Kosovo has, by all accounts, convinced Brown to work with Clark to rewrite American defense policy entirely, with the two of them holding at least one phone call a week to discuss the matters. Although no formal draft of any plan exists, we can infer, based on public statements and actions, that it looks something like this. Above all else, it is of the highest importance that the United States maintains its status as the only superpower. First, this means preventing Russian expansion or rearmament, exemplified by the American airstrikes on Grozny after an American citizen was killed in a Chechen terror attack, sending the message that the U.S. has control over seeming Russian jurisdiction. This also means expanding NATO, with the Visegrad Group expected to join in late 2000 after years of slow-walking negotiations. Second, this means diplomatic isolation of China combined with deepening of American economic ties, with the U.S. seeking to create a partnership where China is solely reliant on U.S. investment.</p>
<p>The other main thrust of Clark’s policy is a dramatic buildup in measures meant to increase homeland security. Brown has advocated for, and begun the process of, entirely digitalizing the military at a rapid speed, creating a new division that can both carry out and prevent cyberattacks on an unprecedented scale. The other angle of homeland security reform involves ruthlessly striking enemy combatants and potential enemy combatants with extreme power and precision, targeting drug lords, terrorists, and a whole host of various security threats at the cost of thousands of collateral lives. Simultaneously, overall defense spending has actually decreased, with these reforms being counterbalanced by a rapid decrease in the number of active military personnel and a massive downsizing of traditional land forces.</p>
<p>Now, as we enter the twilight of Brown’s time in office, it is increasingly clear that Brown is grooming Clark for continued involvement as a decision-maker. He’s pressured every Democratic candidate for president to consider Clark as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the next administration, even calling John McCain to sing Clark’s praises. In the event that Clark is unable to secure a military position, which would force him to retire, it’s an open secret that Brown wants him to run for president in 2004, and has already connected him with the heads of several PACs. Regardless of what General Clark’s future holds, his legacy, and that of President Brown, will almost certainly be remembered as one that helped cement American power at the cost of a new age of hybrid warfare, more deadly to civilians than ever. To quote President Brown in a speech given shortly after the conclusion of the bombing in Yugoslavia, “the job is done only when we say it’s done.”</p>

        <p>Transcript of Police Interview — 24 February 2008 | Moscow City Police Department, District 3 | Case File #2008-217-B | Officer: Senior Constable Dmitry Alekseyev | Subject: Pavel Antonovich Krylov</p>
<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT</p>
<p>[RECORDING INITIATED – 09:07 AM]</p>
<p>OFFICER ALEKSEYEV:</p>
<p>Okay, recorder is on. This is... Senior Constable Dmitry Alekseyev, badge number 114586, conducting a preliminary interview in connection with the incident at 128 Prechistenka Street, the Moscow campaign headquarters of one Mr. Mikhail Dmitrievich Prokhorov. Time is 09:07 on the 24th of February. Present with me is... sir, could you please state your full name for the record?</p>
<p>KRYLOV:</p>
<p>Pavel Antonovich Krylov.</p>
<p>ALEKSEYEV:</p>
<p>Thank you. Your role at the office?</p>
<p>KRYLOV:</p>
<p>Officially, I am a volunteer coordinator. I also did logistics, scheduled canvassing, managed incoming donations, media support, door-knocking teams, all that.</p>
<p>ALEKSEYEV:</p>
<p> Right. Thank you. I, uh, I’ve been told you were at the office yesterday during the incident?</p>
<p>KRYLOV:</p>
<p>Yes. I was there. I was in the back room. With some volunteers. I heard everything.</p>
<p>ALEKSEYEV:</p>
<p>Right. So... okay. I’m going to need you to walk me through what happened. Please start from the beginning. Take your time.</p>
<p>KRYLOV:</p>
<p>Alright. We started the morning like any other. Cup of tea, all of that business. Phones wouldn’t stop ringing. We had a visit scheduled from some independent European observers–journalists, sort of, they call themselves some type of NGOs–but they never showed. Not surprising. People get skittish when bullets start flying.</p>
<p>ALEKSEYEV:</p>
<p>Bullets?</p>
<p>KRYLOV:</p>
<p>No, I mean in general. Not yesterday morning. That came later. What I’m saying is, everyone’s afraid. No one says it aloud, but we all feel it. Luzhkov’s people are everywhere. You ever try to take a walk down the street without running into someone who works for him, or someone whose wife’s sister’s uncle is his chief of staff?</p>
<p>ALEKSEYEV:</p>
<p> I don’t know. Maybe? Sometimes?</p>
<p>KRYLOV:</p>
<p>Right. Well, try running a campaign that’s challenging a sitting president who acts more like a mafioso than a head of state. The tension’s constant. We knew there’d be trouble, but we didn’t think they’d go that far.</p>
<p>ALEKSEYEV:</p>
<p>Yes, the attack. Please describe what you saw.</p>
<p>KRYLOV:</p>
<p>It was around 14:40 in the afternoon. First, the front door slammed open. Four men came in. All masked, dressed in black. Tactical gear. Not random thugs. These were professionals. I’m talking about military posture, coordinated movement. You don’t get that out of some street gang.</p>
<p>ALEKSEYEV:</p>
<p>Guns?</p>
<p>KRYLOV:</p>
<p>Yes. Guns are a hobby of mine, so I was able to spot their weapons immediately. Kalashnikov variants. Modernized. One had a suppressed submachine gun with speciality sights, which you don’t get on the street unless someone’s supplying them from inside an arms depot. Another had a short-barrel AK-104, clean, no scratches. Factory-fresh. You want to tell me what street gang gets those?</p>
<p>ALEKSEYEV:</p>
<p>I, I’m not sure. I only just got this posting last month. Still doing training on identifying small arms.</p>
<p>KRYLOV:</p>
<p>That sounds about right.</p>
<p>ALEKSEYEV:</p>
<p>Sorry?</p>
<p>KRYLOV:</p>
<p>Nothing. So they came in, didn’t say a word. They didn’t even shout. Just started firing. Reception was first. Nadya... she was behind the desk. Took two to the chest before she could stand. Then they moved through the front office. Arkady tried to rush them… the idiot thought he could tackle one. They shot him point blank. No hesitation.</p>
<p>ALEKSEYEV:</p>
<p>Did they steal anything? Computers? Files?</p>
<p>KRYLOV:</p>
<p>No. That’s the thing. They weren’t there to steal. They weren’t even looking. They destroyed a lot, fired a lot of bullets, but as far as intelligence goes? Nothing. They were there to send a message. Wipe the floor with us. Show what happens when you make the wrong type of noise.</p>
<p>ALEKSEYEV:</p>
<p>How did you survive?</p>
<p>KRYLOV:</p>
<p>I was just outside of the back room, and there were three others already in there–brunette Irina, blonde Irina, and Andrei. I pulled the door shut and locked it. We kept quiet. They didn’t reach us. There was a lot of shooting, but it was fast. I heard them leaving maybe three minutes later. Efficient. In and out in under four minutes. That’s not chaos. That’s training.</p>
<p>ALEKSEYEV:</p>
<p>So you think this was political?</p>
<p>KRYLOV:</p>
<p>What do you think? You think this was some robbery gone wrong? You think someone breaks into a campaign office, kills two people in broad daylight in the middle of Moscow just for fun? Maybe if they had taken anything, but there wasn’t a single paperclip missing. Just lots and lots of computers and filing cabinets with holes in them.</p>
<p>ALEKSEYEV:</p>
<p>Huh, that’s interesting.</p>
<p>KRYLOV:</p>
<p>It’s Luzhkov. Always has been. Bratva. His connections go back years with them. He’s never been the closest with the Moscow ones, but he has the Azeris, Georgians, Armenians, Chechens, all the Caucasian ones. He was with Mogilevich in the ’90s. Then he turned on Mogilevich, cut a deal with the other bosses, made peace with the generals, and started climbing. That man’s whole rise is written in blood. Gets control of Moscow in ‘92, and the rest is history. But we don’t talk about that, do we? Because if you talk about that, someone ends up in the river.</p>
<p>ALEKSEYEV:</p>
<p>Sir, I… I don’t want to speculate on any of this.</p>
<p>KRYLOV:</p>
<p>Yeah, I know. "I don’t know anything." That’s the refrain. You’re just here to file the forms, tick the boxes. It’ll get filed and forgotten. Look, I’m not naive. I know Prokhorov isn’t a saint. He made his money in Norilsk. Nothing good happens there, you don’t have to tell me. He plays dirty. But at least he has a plan. He wants to open things up. Modernize. Yeah, he’ll skim off the top–maybe a lot–but at least the trains will run on time again. You’ll be able to walk a block anywhere outside of Red Square without a shooting.</p>
<p>ALEKSEYEV:</p>
<p> You’re saying he’s corrupt?</p>
<p>KRYLOV:</p>
<p>I never used that word, okay? I’m saying he’s not ideal. But corruption isn’t our biggest problem. Stagnation is. Instability. Prokhorov’s corrupt, maybe, but he’s not a murderer. Luzhkov has had journalists poisoned. Remember Yuliana Cherkasova? Gone. Investigating the offshore accounts of the deputy prime minister. Dead in her apartment. Ruled a gas leak. Her brother was an EMT. Told me her lips were blue. You know what causes that? Cyanide. Not a gas leak.</p>
<p>ALEKSEYEV:</p>
<p>Do you have proof of that?</p>
<p>KRYLOV:</p>
<p>Doesn’t matter. Proof dies here. Evidence disappears. Investigators get reassigned. You know how it works. The only reason you’re even talking to me is because it happened in the open. Cameras caught the shooters leaving. You’ll never find them. You’ll file the report, mark it unsolved, and go back to traffic duty.</p>
<p>ALEKSEYEV:</p>
<p>That’s not fair.</p>
<p>KRYLOV:</p>
<p>No, it isn’t. None of this is. This country’s been frozen since 1991. Same faces, same games. Luzhkov acts like he’s some type of saint because our elections have a fair counting process. Oh, so now we’re finally equal with the Ukrainians. But who casts the ballots? What… incentives do they have? Look, Prokhorov is an oligarch. He’s not a hero. He’s just the next version of the same thing. But at least he’s a version who wants to give us stability. You remember, from childhood? It’s been a long 17 years, hasn’t it?</p>
<p>ALEKSEYEV:</p>
<p>But why work for him, if he’s also dirty?</p>
<p>KRYLOV:</p>
<p> Because sometimes you vote for the surgeon with shaky hands when the only other option is a drunkard with a hacksaw. This isn’t about hope. This is about survival. End the economic crisis every two years. End the petty civil wars that keep popping up. When my niece comes to visit me from Voronezh, make it so that she has to pay the conductor instead of the mafia to ride the train. Give Prokhorov some time to use his business magic, fill the obvious holes. Then, hopefully, we’ll be ready for someone with real vision.</p>
<p>ALEKSEYEV:</p>
<p>What do you want me to do with all this?</p>
<p>KRYLOV:</p>
<p>Write it down. Or don’t. It’ll be buried either way. But remember it. When the next body drops, remember this conversation. See if you can spot the difference between an enemy of Luzhkov and a normal civilian.</p>
<p>[PAUSE – 18 SECONDS]</p>
<p>ALEKSEYEV:</p>
<p>Okay... I think we’ll conclude this session. Thank you, Mr. Krylov. I’ll make sure this is included in the file.</p>
<p>KRYLOV:</p>
<p>You won’t. But thanks for pretending.</p>
<p>[RECORDING ENDS – 09:37 AM]</p>

    <p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">Excerpts from popular Youtuber This Crazy World’s video on travelling in Serbia, entitled “THE SERBIA THAT WESTERN MEDIA WON’T SHOW YOU”</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">0:05</span><br>NADINE: Hey, everyone, this is Nadine here, back in my natural habitat in Eastern Europe. For a few years, I’ve teased a trip to Serbia on this channel, and today, I’m pleased to announce that I’ve finally made it. This is This Crazy World, and welcome to Belgrade, the capital of Serbia!</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">3:13</span><br>NADINE: …anyway, getting the visa to go to Serbia was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. First off, they do everything in person, so I had to go to the Serbian embassy in London for an interview. Now, let me list every item that I needed to provide: death certificates for my deceased parents, 3 months of bank statements, all visas for the past 5 years, a flight booking into Belgrade International Airport, seven vaccinations, a complete itinerary, all my hotel bookings, an invitation from a local travel agency, and signed confirmation that I understood every offense that carries a potential of life imprisonment under Serbian law. Fun stuff! Once you go to get the visa, too, they make you promise that you have no connections to Kosovo or Bosnia, and that you have no plans to travel there at any point. Last but not least, I had to state that I was not a lesbian or transgender, although they didn’t go so far as to physically check.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">5:52</span><br>NADINE: Anyways, a regular Youtuber would start this video off by going to see the main attractions around town, but that’s not why you’re subscribed to this channel. Instead, I’ll be going to Deponija, which is a neighborhood that’s regarded as being one of the worst in town. There are obviously hundreds of thousands of Bosnian Serb refugees in the country, and this is a place that never quite got over being a refugee camp. Today, it’s still a working class-slum, one of the worst neighborhoods in Belgrade. And that’s why we’re going there.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">8:23</span><br>NADINE: Wow, this is just… stunning from a European country, only two hours away from the Hungarian border.<br>MAN: Excuse me, you’re speaking English, yes?<br>NADINE: I am, yes.<br>MAN: What are you doing here? This not safe neighborhood for people who don’t already know Serbian.<br>NADINE: Ooh, I’m afraid that I know Russian, but no Serbian.<br>MAN: That’s tough.<br>NADINE: Tell you what, you seem nice. If I hand you some dinars, would you mind escorting me around?<br>MAN: Nothing better to do. Sure, why not?</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">10:02</span><br>NADINE: So, Marko, how did you end up here?<br>MARKO: I was born here. My family, they come from Banja Luka before I was born. Terrible tragedy.<br>NADINE: So you’re not from here?<br>MARKO: No, from Bosnia. Then those bastards came, and that was that. All gone.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">13:37</span><br>NADINE: So what’s the difference between a Serbian Serb and a Bosnian Serb? As I’m walking around here, it looks somewhat scary, but all the people talk and act the same?<br>MARKO: Oh yeah, there’s not a big difference from looks. It’s all personality.<br>NADINE: Explain, if you can.<br>MARKO: Bosnian Serbs, we are more…traditional, let’s say. Just different. More connected to the Balkan earth, more religious. Lots of people, especially in Belgrade, aren’t like that.<br>NADINE: And would you say that you have conflict with the real Serbian Serbs?<br>MARKO: Somewhat. They dislike us, so we dislike them right back. We didn’t choose to move here, but the bastards forced us. So in that sense, we are united. One day, we will return.<br>NADINE: Even with the border as fortified as it is?<br>MARKO: We’ll find a way.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">18:28</span><br>MARKO: We don’t get many Westerners here, you know.<br>NADINE: In this neighborhood?<br>MARKO: Well, especially in this neighborhood, but not too many in Serbia at all.<br>NADINE: Who do you get?<br>MARKO: Russians, Chinese, a few North Koreans, since they have contracts for a lot of our guns. Kim-Jong-Un has been here and gotten a parade a few times. Some Turks, occasionally, some various Africans. Most Europeans are Germans, since they have a few investments here.<br>NADINE: English, like me? Americans?<br>MARKO: You’d have to be pretty stupid to be an American and come to Deponija. First, it’s hard to get in and leave, and second, people might be upset at you. I’ve never seen one, I’ll say that.<br>NADINE: But English? Or someone from the U.K.?<br>MARKO: Only one guy. Bald guy English like you, tried to speak in really bad Russian. Said that he loved our culture.<br>NADINE: What was his deal?<br>MARKO: Bad stuff. How do you say it in English, ped-oh-feel?<br>NADINE: Pedophile?<br>MARKO: Yeah, that’s it. He was a pedophile. Bad guy. But they caught him.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">24:17</span><br>NADINE: So, Šešelj, as I understand, we’re not allowed to talk about him? Like, if I spoke too loud about him on the street and was doing so in a negative tone, the police would come take me away?<br>MARKO: Yeah, basically. If I were you, I would, um, wait until I get home to upload this video. Trust me, you’ll thank me later.<br>NADINE: What’s the worst that could happen?<br>MARKO: Torture, probably. Prison, definitely. Maybe nothing, but it’s a dumb risk.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">28:57</span><br>NADINE: So, Marko, now that you’ve shown me around this… interesting, let’s just say, neighborhood, do you ever want to leave?<br>MARKO: Somewhere else in Belgrade would be nice, I guess.<br>NADINE: Not the West?<br>MARKO: It’s hard. You have to know the right people. You think someone whose family is from Banja Luka knows them? Not much of a chance.<br>NADINE: And… less legal means, are those realistic or not?<br>MARKO: Šešelj keeps a tight watch on the border. The electric fence is pretty brutal. I’ve heard of a few of us getting to Austria, but not many.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">31:28</span><br>NADINE: Well, Marko was just the most interesting guy. Now, since we’re about done with Deponija, let’s move on to–<br>SERBIAN POLICE OFFICER: Шта то радиш?<br>NADINE: Pardon me, I don’t know Serbian?<br>SERBIAN POLICE OFFICER: Да ли знаш руски?<br>NADINE: Pуски?<br>SERBIAN POLICE OFFICER: Да, русский язык<br>NADINE: Да, я знаю русский.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">38:44</span><br>NADINE: Anyway, I’m recording this from the airport in Frankfurt now. To be clear, what you just saw was me giving an official apology to the great nation of Serbia and to the Marshal of Serbia, great Marshal Šešelj, for using a video camera in public without official public approval. After I recorded that, they took the camera from me and confiscated it, but they let me keep the sd card and watched me upload it to Serbian social media.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">46:09</span><br>NADINE: …so, suffice to say, unless I ever get in the mood for killing Kosovars, you won’t ever see me going to Serbia again. The people were nice, the food was wonderful, and there’s so much that happened there that I couldn’t capture on camera, but it’s just too unsafe, even for a normal white woman from an EU country like me. Unless something changes, and Šešelj decides to join the rest of the world, I can safely say that I will not be going back. Until this, I’m Nadine, and this is This Crazy World.</p>

    <p style="text-align:left; font-weight:bold;">December 3rd, 1999</p>
    <p>[In the guard’s breakroom at the United Nations Detention Unit]</p>
    <p>Adam: I swear to God, I’ve about had it with Tudjman.</p>
    <p>Michael: What do you mean, had it with him?</p>
    <p>Adam: I mean that I don’t want to listen to him talk ever again. If I never had to hear from him again in my life, I could die happy.</p>
    <p>Michael: Come on, now, you’re working at the Hague. You’re supposed to be made of stronger stuff, humanitarian stuff, even if it’s still a prison.</p>
    <p>Adam: I can’t do it! I can’t do it! Every single day, I say “Okay, Mr. Tudjman, I’m ready to open your cell, and he always tries to correct me to use ‘vrhovnik.’ Then, once I finally get him out, he starts goose-stepping everywhere and randomly saluting me.</p>
    <p>Michael: Maybe he means well with it? Just trying to play devil’s advocate.</p>
    <p>Adam: Not a chance; I don’t believe it. Do you know Wim? Short guy, super laid-back?</p>
    <p>Michael: Can’t say that I know him well.</p>
    <p>Adam: It’s terrible. Tudjman has gotten him to use “vrhovnik” sometimes. And the Croat has also asked Wim to print out publicity photos for him, which he then signs. Promises that they’ll all be worth a fortune one day, after he gets proven not guilty.</p>
    <p>Michael: Look, if this is too hard for you, why don’t you say something about it.</p>
    <p>Adam: It’s not hard, just annoying, so damn annoying. You know something? Wim printed out a big, blank map of the Balkans for Tudjman to draw on. I made him show it to me, and it’s all just either under the Croatian banner or under some type of Croatian control.</p>
    <p>Michael: Okay, I’ll give that one to you, it’s a bit off the rails.</p>
    <p>Adam: And that’s not all! He’s tried to request his own clothing to wear to court. He wants a massive army coat, dozens of medals, golden epaulets, and a peaked cap. He threw a fit when the judge ruled that he had to be referred to as president, and not “leader” or “ruler” or something like that.</p>
    <p>Michael: I get it, I really do. But you have to let justice decide his course, not us.</p>
    <p>Adam: Yeah, but you have to admit, wouldn’t it feel good if he were dead? If we treated him like the Nazis and brought him around back?</p>
    <p>Michael: But we can’t do that. We’re trying to set a precedent here.</p>
    <p>Adam: I understand the precedent. I’m not going to kill him. But do you know what he did?</p>
    <p>Michael: Horrific things. Murder, rape, et cetera. I completely get it. We have loads of those types from the Balkans.</p>
    <p>Adam: All I’m saying is that it somehow get worse than just a few murders or rapes. Read the paper, do some research on Herceg-Bosna and what they were doing in there. Trust me, you’ll thank me later. You’ll never be able to look at him again without wanting to strangle him with your bare hands.</p>
    <p>Michael: I feel like a broken record, Adam, but it’s all about justice. Let the court decide.</p>
    <p>Adam: The court, great. I’ll admit, we should feel lucky. We’re lucky that the Germans and Americans quit on him and let him get handed over.</p>
    <p>Michael: That’s the spirit, that’s more like it!</p>
    <p>Adam: Imagine losing Zagreb’s backing, as a Croat. Crazy, right? What a guy.</p>
    <p>Michael: Yeah, what a guy indeed. It’s about time now. Should we go wake him up?</p>
    <p>Adam: Let’s do it.</p>
    <p>[Adam and Michael walk to Tudjman’s cell]</p>
    <p>Adam: Mister Tudjman, we’re letting you out for the morning.</p>
    <p>Michael: Does he usually take this long to respond?</p>
    <p>Adam: It’s the stupid vrhovnik thing, I told you. Mister Tudjman, I’m not calling you vrhovnik today! Don’t try and bother with it?</p>
    <p>Michael: Come on, Adam, let me try. Vrhovnik Tudjman! We’re ready for you!</p>
    <p>Adam: There’s nothing. Damn it, let’s go in. If that hasn’t satisfied him, something’s wrong.</p>
    <p>Michael: We’re coming in now. No sudden movements.</p>
    <p>[The door opens]</p>
    <p>Adam: Michael, he doesn’t look alive.</p>
    <p>Michael: Damn it, let me get his pulse.</p>
    <p>Adam: Anything, anything at all? It can’t end like this.</p>
    <p>Michael: I’m afraid not. The vrhovnik… he’s dead.</p>`

    <p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">Delaware Senator Draws Bipartisan Criticism for Twitter Post</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">September 9, 2022</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Boston Globe</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Milo Nabers</p>
<p>WILMINGTON—Delaware senator Joe Biden, a Democrat, faced swift backlash Friday after posting an image on Twitter that many interpreted as mocking the Queen of England’s death. Roughly two hours after the Queen passed away at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, as tributes from world leaders continued to pour in, Biden posted an edited drawing of the British cartoon character Peppa Pig wearing a balaclava and standing beside an Irish flag.</p>
<p>Almost immediately, critics accused Biden of celebrating the monarch’s death. The balaclava in the image resembled the type worn by members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), the paramilitary organization responsible for numerous attacks during the Troubles, the decades-long ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland that lasted from the late 1960s until the Whit Monday Agreement in 2000.</p>
<p>For longtime observers of Biden’s political career, the post was surprising but not necessarily shocking. Biden, who has represented Delaware in the Senate since 1973, is well-liked in his home state and generally respected in Washington. His tendency toward verbal slips and high-profile miscues, however, is well documented—most notably the plagiarism allegations that derailed his 1988 presidential bid. Still, despite being 79, Biden is widely regarded as sharper than many of his peers, leading critics and supporters alike to question whether such a post could truly have been accidental.</p>
<p>When asked for comment, Biden’s office released the following statement: “Senator Biden is a proud Irish-American who has long worked to strengthen the bond between the United States and the Republic of Ireland. While some may view the post as regrettable, Senator Biden did not intend to celebrate the Queen’s passing. He wishes to commemorate her life and legacy. Senator Biden and his family extend their condolences to the Royal Family during this difficult time, and he wishes King Charles well as he assumes the responsibilities of the throne.”</p>
<p>Biden himself has not clarified the post, nor has he made any additional statements or social media activity since the incident.</p>

<p>Martin Campbell: I don’t get it. You’re James Bond! This is an exciting opportunity.</p>
<p>Mel Gibson: Marty, Marty, Marty. You dumb bitch.</p>
<p>Martin Campbell: Very calmly, just tell me what’s wrong. Please?</p>
<p>Mel Gibson: Do you know how much I’ve been through? How much I’ve suffered for this goddamn film? Why can't you be a director who fucking supports me instead of a director that sucks my MANY opponents off? And it just sucks me dry. I don't believe you anymore. I'm sick of your bullshit! Has any movie ever worked with you? NO!</p>
<p>Martin Campbell: Listen to me. You don't understand me because somebody who knows what goes into directing a movie does not behave this way. I know that you saw what Woo did on For Queen and Country, I know that you said you wanted to be on a project that did something similar, but there’s more–</p>
<p>Mel Gibson: I made FUCKING BRAVEHEART. You see me? I AM William Wallace. Alba gu bràth! He is fucking me. Who do you think you are? Your mother fucking ******** you, probably.</p>
<p>Martin Campell: Look, about the directing thing, I know you did Braveheart, I love it, but let me explain–</p>
<p>Mel Gibson: NO! ALBA GU BRATH! Take that, fucker!</p>
<p>Martin Campbell: Okay, calm down, when you said you wanted to meet me, I presumed that–</p>
<p>Mel Gibson: Shut the fuck up! I didn’t finish! I have plenty of energy to keep going. You understand me? AND I WILL! SO JUST FUCKING LISTEN TO ME. LISTEN TO MY FUCKING RANTING. LISTEN TO WHAT YOU DO TO ME.</p>

<p>Martin Campbell: Israel? The country of Israel? The Middle East? Eurasia? I don’t know.</p>
<p>Mel Gibson: Good fucking answer, Marty, ISRAEL! Shooting this retarded fucking movie in fucking Israel, it’s like babes in fucking k***land over here–</p>
<p>Martin Campbell: Mel, what the hell? You’re being anti-semetic!</p>
<p>Mel Gibson: –in fucking Jewland? With a fucking y** on every corner? I got fucking kids, you hear me? KIDS!</p>

<p>Mel Gibson: FUCKING CHILDREN WHO COULD BE–</p>
<p>Martin Campbell: Let me finish!</p>
<p>Mel Gibson: Fine, one fucking second, retard.</p>
<p>Martin Campbell: There’s a part of the script that takes place in Israel. So we went to Israel to shoot it. That’s all there is to it. You know, movies, we always go around the world.</p>
<p>Mel Gibson: Who wrote the fucking script, Marty? Huh?</p>
<p>Martin Campbell: Uh, Bruce, Bruce Feirstein.</p>
<p>Mel Gibson: FEIRSTEIN. IT’S A FUCKING Y** NAME. IT’S THE FUCKING JEWS, MARTY! THE JEWS! THE JEWS! IT’S ALWAYS THE FUCKING JEWS!</p>
<p>Martin Campbell: I don’t get it, you keep on talking about the y–well, the Jews. What’s your problem? You can’t possibly be an antisemite. It’s the 21st century, for crying out loud.</p>
<p>Mel Gibson: All of the fucking messes we’re in, it’s the fucking Jews. It’s basic research.</p>
<p>Martin Campbell: Well, I, I don’t believe that.</p>
<p>Mel Gibson: Wait, are you a Jew?</p>
<p>Martin Campbell: I’m not, never have been one.</p>
<p>Mel Gibson: Shut the fuck up, Jew! You should just fucking smile and blow me, fucking **** ******! 'Cause I deserve it.</p>
<p>Martin Campbell: Oh, that’s it. I’ve had it. We’re going to end this, we’re going to take 20 minutes to cool down, and then we’re going to go back to making the movie, with our LOVELY Jewish crew members, who have worked so damn hard for us.</p>
<p>Mel Gibson: You have no fucking soul! My soul is screaming because you don't have one to join mine. You have no fucking soul. We had no spiritual common ground! You’re just like the fucking Jews. You and I have none. No connection. Zero. You don’t get what it’s like to be MEL FUCKING GIBSON, bitch.</p>
<p>Martin Cambell: You just enjoy insulting me. That's all.</p>
<p>Mel Gibson: Fuck you, I so fucking do. Because you've hurt me so bad. You insult me with every look, every breath, every heartbeat. When you’ve been behind that camera, I see how you’ve been watching me. You hate me. You want this movie to fail so that the k**** can make an insurance claim.</p>
<p>Martin Campbell: I did not do anything. I apologize for nothing.</p>
<p>Mel Gibson: What? What? You apologize for nothing? Well then you're a dishonest ****, fucking retard! Because you need to apologize for a reason.</p>
<p>Martin Campbell: You need medication.</p>
<p>Mel Gibson: What? What?</p>
<p>Martin Campbell: You need medication.</p>
<p>Mel Gibson: I DO NOT NEED MEDICATION. I DO NOT NEED MEDICATION, AND I ESPECIALLY DO NOT NEED JEWISH MEDICATION FROM A PHARMACY IN FUCKING ISRAEL. You need a fucking bat to the side of the head. All right? How about that? You need a fucking  doctor. You need a fucking  brain transplant. You need a fucking… you need a fucking soul.</p>
<p>Martin Campbell: I'll call the police.</p>
<p>Mel Gibson: What?</p>
<p>Martin Campbell: I'll call the police.</p>
<p>Mel Gibson: What, the Jew squadron would take me away? Fucking bitches.</p>
<p>Martin Campbell: Mel, I don’t WANT to call the police. I just want you to calm down.</p>
<p>Mel Gibson: Why don't you fuck off to that **** bitch Craig. He wanted to do the fucking movie. And he could’ve done that, and while he was playing fucking y** spy, I would be at his house. His bitch would have sucked me in 5 SECONDS. 5 seconds, she would’ve blown me in 5 seconds!</p>
<p>Martin Campbell: What are you even talking about? Is it the Jews? Look, I want to be your friend. I have nothing against you.</p>
<p>Mel Gibson: I’M NOT YOUR FRIEND. You don't have any fucking friends except me. And you treat me like shit. So that's why I'm so fucking angry. Because I don't have any friends. And I try to make one from you and you treat me like shit and you fucking use me for this Jew movie. You just showed me what you are. Absolutely. Unequivocally.</p>
<p>Martin Campbell: Mel, for the last time, get out, and calm down. I’m calling the police in 15 seconds.</p>
<p>Mel Gibson: Fine, I’ll stand under the JEW SUN OF ISRAEL and think about this shitty movie. Fuck you, Marty.</p>
<p>Martin Campbell: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Gibson’s Bond movie would go on to critical acclaim and box office success, with the actor crediting his performance to “my warm relationship with Martin Campbell, a wonderful director.”</p>

    <p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">Excerpt from a 60 Minutes Interview with Jerry Brown</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold; text-align:left;">September 9, 2018</p>
<p>Interviewer: You’ve often spoken about how the world, as it exists today, is in a pitiful state and is hurtling towards destruction. But what do you think needs to change?</p>
<p>Brown: Oh, everything.</p>
<p>Interviewer: Everything? What do you mean by that?</p>
<p>Brown: I mean, just about every aspect of the human experience as we know it needs a dramatic rethinking. We are dramatically stupid, more stupid than any species of our brain capacity has a right to be. We ignore the evidence we have telling us to not do things. We know everything that should not be done, and not a single educated person in power doesn’t know that. And yet, they do it anyway.</p>
<p>I don’t know how we change this, to be dead honest with you. I know the future, in all of its glory, and it will take the form of a collision with reality. But instead of braking, the powers that be are accelerating. I’m very afraid that I’ll live to see it happen, even as old as I am. I’m absolutely terrified for the younger generations who almost certainly will see the collision.</p>
<p>Interviewer: Okay, so you say that we need to change everything, but what actually needs to change? What even is stupidity? Other than big concepts, what actual actions can we take to make a difference?</p>
<p>Brown: You want an example? Think of Volkswagen. You know, back in the day, I went and toured the factory. It’s a wonderful place, with a lot going on. It’s very eye-opening. And these Germans, they insist up and down that they’re frugal, that they’re precise. I can’t walk into too many restaurants over there without having some cash on me just in case they don’t take credit cards. So they’re serious people, right?</p>
<p>But you’re wrong! Because suddenly here comes Volkswagen, lying about their emissions, deceiving their customers, regulatory agencies, and deceiving the environment. So now we have an entire culture which is based around certain ideals completely disregarding these ideals because of the economic system of the world.</p>
<p>Interviewer: You mean capitalism?</p>
<p>Brown: I do, I’m talking about capitalism. If you want me to be more specific, I’m especially talking about the neoliberal variant that we’ve seen take over in the past 25, 30 years.</p>
<p>Interviewer: But what’s so bad about capitalism? You’ve gone on record multiple times saying that you believe strongly in it, that you reject socialism and other ideologies that oppose it.</p>
<p>Brown: When I talk about capitalism, I’m talking about the capitalism that exists today, not the capitalism that existed decades ago. It’s all short-term profits and enriching those at the top. Back in the day, there was growth for the sake of improving lives. Now it’s growth for the sake of growth. I don’t know what changed, and it may be that we were always on a fixed timeline–in which case we do need to rethink capitalism as a whole–but I think of an anecdote from a Russian diplomat in D.C. when the Soviet Union collapsed. An American diplomatic friend comes to visit him, and he sees the Russian crying. The American asks him what exactly he’s crying over, and the Russian says it’s the fate of the world.</p>
<p>Now, the American assumes that he’s talking about the fate of the world because of communism’s collapse, so he tries to assuage the Russian. But the Russian corrects him. He says that now, because the communists are gone and there is no great enemy to restrain the capitalists, that they’re free to act without inhibition, without any fear that something could surpass them. By collapsing, the Soviet Union has doomed the world to a unipolar capitalist consensus into a death march into collapse.</p>
<p>Interviewer: But what, then, should we do about it, especially if you say that you’re still a capitalist?</p>
<p>Brown: There's only one way out. Disruptive action. Show the people in charge–and I mean the people like me–that the people of this planet won’t go into a death march willingly. Take Volkswagen. Now, I’m not saying that your first move needs to be pouring sand into Volkswagen fuel tanks, but you also need to have that as an option on the table. To be clear, I’m not advocating for violence. I don’t think that a vigilante shooting Martin Winterkorn or Jeff Bezos or whoever solves anything. But at the same time, you have to show people you care, and show people that you’re willing to go the distance to do it.</p>
<p>So, yeah, real damage needs to be on the table. Volkswagen can take it in the long run. The Germans can take it in the long run. The Americans can take it in the long run. We all can. Because, and I know this for a fact, if we don’t course-correct now, which we show no signs of doing, the Earth will course-correct for us. And when that time comes, it’s going to look a lot worse than sand in Karen’s Jetta.</p>
<p>Interviewer: What’s the worst that could happen?</p>
<p>Brown: First, the second-worst that could happen is ecological collapse. That will be horrific. And it’s a more likely case than the worst-case, thankfully. But the worst case is nuclear war. Humanity will survive ecological collapse in mass numbers. But imagine a scenario where things get so strained that someone decides to use nuclear weapons to get what they consider to be their fair share, or that someone becomes a real nihilist in the face of collapse. That, I fear, is something that humanity survives in small numbers at the absolute best. Maybe we will go extinct; I don’t know.</p>
<p>Interviewer: Well, let’s switch subjects now, if you don’t mind. What do you think about China’s proposal to switch entirely to renewable energy by 2050?</p>
<p>Brown: Gosh, that’s an interesting topic. Where do I even begin?</p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">A Border Visit, and a Presidential Prelude, for Senator Rubio</h1>
    <p><strong>Allison Raines</strong></p>
    <p><strong>July 16, 2014</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The New York Times</strong></p>
    <p>In a visit that underscored both policy ambition and political calculation, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, stood at the United States-Mexico border on Tuesday and declared that the nation’s immigration system was “broken, outdated, and in need of a complete overhaul, not more razor wire.”</p>
    <p>The Cuban-American senator’s remarks, delivered in the arid heat of Nogales, Arizona, were part of a theoretically nonpartisan trip that combined border inspection and bipartisan outreach with the unmistakable optics of a national campaign-in-waiting. Long a prominent voice in the Senate’s immigration negotiations, Mr. Rubio is increasingly viewed by political operatives and donors as preparing for a presidential bid in 2016, testing a message that walks a fine line between conservative orthodoxy and pragmatic reform.</p>
    <p>“The choice isn’t between security and compassion,” Mr. Rubio said, flanked by border officials and small-business leaders. “The choice is whether we want chaos, or whether we want a system that reflects American values and enforces American law.”</p>
    <p>Mr. Rubio, 42, was a central figure in the so-called Twelve Disciples, a bipartisan group of senators that secured passage of a landmark immigration bill offering a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants in June of this year. The bill also requires expanded legal immigration channels, mandatory employment verification systems, and significant investment in border monitoring technology. But it was Rubio’s successful push for pilot programs to streamline entry for Mexican seasonal laborers and family-sponsored immigrants that has attracted particular attention from both critics and supporters.</p>
    <p>His trip this week was designed not just to reinforce support for that measure, but to do so while projecting executive credibility. The events included private briefings with local law enforcement, a town hall with residents of Santa Cruz County, and a stop at the Mariposa Port of Entry to highlight delays in cross-border commerce. Marking a break from the normal routine of border visits, Rubio also crossed into Mexico for two days to discuss immigration measures with regional Mexican officials and the national police before crossing back into Arizona.</p>
    <p>For Mr. Rubio, whose politics often bounce around the libertarian right and the pro-business center, immigration reform is not a deviation from conservative principles but, in his words, “a necessary modernization of the American promise.” In interviews, he has emphasized that the Republican Party must “adapt to a changing electorate” or risk being left behind by a rising generation of Latino, Asian, and younger voters who reject hardline immigration rhetoric.</p>
    <p>“Senator Rubio sees immigration as a test of whether the GOP can govern,” said Carlos DeLeon, a Republican pollster based in Miami. “He’s betting that voters want solutions on immigration instead of grandstanding against immigrants to no end.”</p>
    <p>That bet carries a great deal of risk. Several prominent Republicans, including Senators Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas and Trey Grayson of Kentucky, have vocally opposed the Senate bill, characterizing it as “amnesty” and accusing Rubio of abandoning conservative principles. Although Rubio won election to the Senate in no small part due to his support from conservative hardliners, many prominent conservatives have already deemed him to be a Republican in name only (RINO), with radio host Rush Limbaugh deriding him as the “White-nosed RINO.”</p>
    <p>Mr. Rubio has dismissed those criticisms as “ideological performance,” and his advisers note that he retains high approval ratings among Florida Republicans, easily defeating prospective primary challengers in a matchup. Rubio maintains a large base of support from the Cuban-American community, of which he is perhaps the most nationally prominent member.</p>
    <p>Unlike many Cuban-American politicians of his generation, however, Rubio has embraced a broader Latino identity and often speaks of the commonalities between Central American migrants, Mexican agricultural workers, and Cuban exiles. “The idea is the same,” he said during an appearance on Univision this week. “People seeking opportunity and freedom.”</p>
    <p>His rhetoric, carefully measured and devoid of bombast, is being watched closely by donors and political analysts as Republicans look toward 2016. While Senators Tom Ridge and Elizabeth Dole have also signaled national ambitions, Rubio is quietly assembling a campaign infrastructure, according to two Republican operatives familiar with the senator’s outreach. He has recently hired staff with national campaign experience and is planning fall trips to Iowa and New Hampshire.</p>
    <p>“He’s not just here to talk immigration,” said Sandra Holbrook, a longtime Republican fundraiser who attended Rubio’s event in Tucson. “He’s here to show that he can talk policy and command the stage. That’s a dry run for the big leagues.”</p>
    <p>Still, the challenge for Rubio will be whether his unique brand of conservatism can translate a Republican electorate which is much more anti-immigration that Rubio is.</p>
    <p>“He’s walking into a headwind,” said Dr. Benjamin Roth, a political historian at the University of Chicago. “But if the party is serious about expanding its coalition in 2016, they will need someone who doesn’t alienate Latinos and independents. Rubio is, arguably, the only top-tier candidate who fits that mold.”</p>
    <p>At a town hall in Mesa with Arizona governor Dan Quayle held the day that Rubio crossed back into the United States, Rubio talked about the future of immigration policies after the success of his bill. “This is not the end of the debate,” Rubio said in Arizona. “It’s the beginning of a better, smarter approach.”</p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">The Mysteries of Rayo de Luna</h1>
    <p><strong>Luis Contreras</strong></p>
    <p><strong>December 9, 2017</strong></p>
    <p>Most countries have one random celebrity who they love to no end, despite the rest of the world seemingly not sharing any particular affection for this person. Germany has David Hasselhoff. France has Jerry Lewis. And Mexico fucking loves Jerry Brown.</p>
    <p>Because most Americans see Mexico as a giant mysterious black box that only contains lazy immigrants, good food, and sombreros, the actual reality of the Mexican cultural scene typically goes completely ignored. To hear the average American tell it, Mexicans only listen to mariachi or, occasionally, ballads about drug lords. Hell, some Mexicans do only listen to that. But according to these Americans, Mexicans don’t really have any culture beyond that.</p>
    <p>Of course, Mexico has thousands of various exemplary entries of art, music, cinema, photography, theater, and just about anything that you can think of which requires legitimate creative effort. And the star of many of these–truly, an inordinate, almost concerning number–is Jerry Brown, Governor Moonbeam himself. If you walk through any alley in Jalisco, there’s at least a 30% chance that you’ll see a mural of Jerry. If you watch any telenovela, there’s a 40% chance that his name is tossed around as a cultural reference that everybody knows. He is, in short, a big fucking deal.</p>
    <p>But I want to cast your attention to the part earlier where I listed theater as an example of somewhere that Mexico had worthwhile creative output. This is because right now, the hottest play in Mexico, and maybe one of the hottest plays in all of Mexican history, is a biopic about Jerry Brown entitled Rayo de Luna. Yes, the hottest show in Mexico City, the play that nobody could ever dream of getting into without being incredibly well-connected or wealthy, is, again, about Jerry Brown. And the weirdest part about the play, in light of its popularity, is that it kinda sucks.</p>
    <p>The first half of the play is a fairly standard by-the-numbers recreation of Jerry’s life, starting from his childhood growing up in his father’s shadow, to his early success as the hip governor of California, to the general unravelling of his life as he proves unable to keep his level of hipness going for an indefinite period of time. In particular, his romance with Linda Rondstadt gets special attention as a truly epic love story; it really helps that the actress they have playing Linda sounds exactly like her (albeit a Spanish-speaking version).</p>
    <p>The play is at its best when Jerry is at the bottom point of his life. Wandering around the world from Japan to India to (gasp!) Mexico, Jerry gets multiple emotional ballads about how he’s mistreated by everyone else and how the mistakes that he’s made won’t prevent him from an epic comeback. By the time that he breathlessly announces his return to the USA and steps onto American soil, you can’t help but feel ready to run through a brick wall for the guy.</p>
    <p>And then, the second half of the play starts.</p>
    <p>Naturally, you’re really pumped up for Jerry to come back, so when he declares his candidacy for president, you get a rush of dopamine like you’ve just injected black tar heroin directly into your cerebral cortex. But then, right as the heroin hits, something goes wrong, almost like the heroin was laced with something else. In real life, Jerry ran an explicitly populist campaign, but the thing that had made it so interesting was that he mixed a lot of left-wing and right-wing proposals together, creating a unique, cohesive whole.</p>
    <p>But in Ray de Luna, Jerry is essentially Che Guevara mixed with Pancho Villa mixed with Leon Trotsky. He sings about spilling the blood of the working man in the final struggle for labor. He promises to put an end to the American capitalist class. He literally waves a red flag at one point during a campaign visit to Mexico (!!!). The Jerry who claimed that cutting teachers would somehow fucking HELP STUDENTS is forgotten, perhaps willingly.</p>
    <p>All of this could be forgiven, though, if Jerry’s story was built up to a final act of sacrifice, if his loss in the 1992 election was an epic loss of the type that would send you immediately to Valhalla, dead but forever enshrined into the hall of the true greats. Instead, we get something else. At first, the play makes it seem like Brown is going to lose, but all of a sudden, announces that there’s been a recount, and that he’s been elected president.</p>
    <p>From there, the play devolves, quite oddly, into exploring counterfactuals, stuff that never was. All of a sudden, Jerry is the serious man in the Oval Office, faced with the responsibility of his presidency and the idea of him supposedly carrying some sort of legacy with him. He has to deal with the economy, with international relations, with his own party who still largely distrusts him. He sits in the Oval Office and sings his damn heart out as he ponders the responsibility of the presidency and his status as a living legend and something bigger than himself.</p>
    <p>This part of the play apparently doesn’t take that long (Mexican audiences seem to think that it’s a breeze), but believe me, it fucking DRAGS. Finally, when Jerry is done bloviating about himself, all of a sudden, a bunch of the characters from the play come and join him, including ones who are out of his life or who logically would hate him, and start a big singalong with him as they gaze out into the audience. Then, Jerry breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to the audience, telling them that everything they just saw was meaningless and didn’t happen and that society shouldn’t venerate him like it does.</p>
    <p>Then the play just ends.</p>
    <p>And that’s it! That’s the whole thing. All of these narratives that have been shoehorned together just revert back to the same place, and the protagonist whose journey you had been following says “peace” and just kinda dips while making some commentary on being in a play. It’s fucking weird and disappointing.</p>
    <p>Still, the Mexicans love it. It’s attracted universally positive reviews, sold absolute fucking units in tickets, and most importantly for Americans, has sparked talk of an English-language adaptation that seeks to copy all of the stuff that made it successful. Will it be successful? Maybe. Will it be good? Probably not.</p>
    <p>Regardless, people have not been able to get over this play in Mexico. Memes from it are omnipresent on Mexican social media sites. People have made countless parodies of it to emulate other politicians. One guy even wrote a fanfic about it where he kept the same basic structure of Rayo de Luna but made it about Ukrainian President Yulia Tymoshenko, adding in a lesbian relationship with Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt. This fanfic fucking rips.</p>
    <p>Rayo de Luna, in a way, almost raises more questions than it answers. Do Mexicans just have incredibly shitty taste in plays? Are we on the verge of a Jerry Brown revolution in the U.S. that the Mexicans have beaten us to the punch on? Are productions about semi-forgotten political figures really the future of theater? As much as Rayo de Luna blows, by acting as a cultural touchstone and inspirational force, it might ultimately do more good than harm, at least by the virtue of being interesting. It’s not much, but it’s as good of an impact that a play like this can expect to have.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">Richard Gere Banned From Saudi Arabia</p>
    <p>November 30, 1997</p>
    <p>Arkansas Democrat-Gazette</p>
    <p>Bill Fromm</p>
    <p>Following the release of Richard Gere’s latest film, Desert Rose, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has announced that he is formally banned from the country. This move comes after years of tension between Gere and Saudi Arabia, beginning in 1993, when he made critical comments of the human rights situation in the country while presenting at the Academy Awards, a move that led to him being banned as a presenter for a period of five years, though he is still welcome to attend the Awards as a guest or as a nominee. Gere, who often takes activist stances, has also spoken in favor of human rights in Tibet and victims of AIDs, and had previously been banned from entering China, although this ban was later lifted.</p>
    <p>Desert Rose, which had an infamously long and troubled production, tells the story of Gere, an American businessman working in Riyadh on behalf of an American oil company, accidentally finding himself serving as a public advocate for Amina, a Saudi woman accused of witchcraft and homosexuality, crimes that are punishable by death in the country. Despite the movie’s production issues and low expectations upon its release, the film has proved to be a critical and commercial success, grossing over $100 million worldwide in the month since its release and generating serious buzz for awards season.</p>
    <p>The movie’s success has led to an outpour of sympathy for the victims of human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia, which most international organizations describe as being one of the single most repressive countries in the world. Several companies have announced their intentions to stop doing business in the country or have cancelled plans to expand there, while a group of celebrities has announced a movement to boycott Saudi oil, petitioning world governments to both find alternate oil sources and to cut down on overall energy usage. Gere, for his part, has urged the public not to forget about the Saudi human rights situation “after it’s fashionable,” stating that true change will only happen as the result of a long and focused campaign.</p>
    <p>Reactions in Saudi Arabia have been fierce, with one prominent Muslim cleric deriding Gere as an “agent of Satan and Western decadence.” Cinemas are banned in Saudi Arabia, prohibiting Saudi citizens from seeing the movie displayed publicly, but the film’s Arabic dub has spread rapidly in the black markets, leading to a police declaration that anyone caught possessing a physical copy of the film will be subject to punishment, including potential prison time and whip lashings. In the international arena, the Saudi government has stayed silent so far, and diplomatic relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia have continued seemingly unhindered.</p>
    <p>Nonetheless, Gere’s ban is the first of its kind for such a high-profile figure. Gere, who has never been to Saudi Arabia and has no travel plans, has not yet issued any reaction to the ban. However, many Saudi dissidents have harshly criticized the government for this action, pointing out that the events of the film focus on a case where the victim of Saudi repression was truly innocent of the charges against her, rather than the film disputing the righteousness of the charges themselves. It remains to be seen what social impacts the movie, which is set to open up in East Asian markets this upcoming weekend, will generate as it continues on its box office run.</p>     `

    <p><strong>Saturday, 10 July 2004, 16:28 GMT / 17:28 UK</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Australian PM wins second term</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Australia’s Prime Minister Kim Beazley says he is “grateful” for his re-election.</li>
      <li>Results indicate a slim majority for Beazley’s Labor Party over Howard's Liberal/National coalition.</li>
      <li>The election mostly focused on domestic issues, though the War in Sudan also played a role in voters’ decision-making.</li>
      <li>In the United States, President Brown called the Prime Minister to congratulate him on his victory.</li>
      <li>During his victory speech, Mr. Beazley said: “I am truly grateful that the Australian people had trust in my government.”</li>
      <li>By winning his second term, Beazley is on track to lead the Labor Party to its 7th win in 21 years.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Losses for Beazley</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Opinion polls during the campaign predicted a hung parliament or a slim Liberal majority; early results, however, showed Mr. Howard’s chances diminishing.</li>
      <li>Howard won several seats in South Australia and Queensland but failed to reach the 76 seats needed for a majority.</li>
      <li>Computer projections suggested Labor could win 79 seats out of 150 in the lower house, a decrease of 8 seats from the last election.</li>
      <li>Labor also lost some previously safe seats to Howard's Coalition.</li>
      <li>Mr. Howard called to concede to Mr. Beazley before announcing his resignation in his constituency of Bennelong.</li>

    <p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">A History of the Polish-Lithuanian War</p>
    <p>June 1989: Semi-free elections in Poland bring Solidarity to power. Lech Wałęsa becomes a key figure in Eastern Europe's democratization, winning the next year’s presidential elections.</p>
    <p>March 1990: Lithuania declares independence from the Soviet Union. The USSR refuses recognition, sparking an economic blockade. Lithuania will eventually fully secure its independence when the USSR falls the next year.</p>
    <p>1990–1991: Lithuanian-Polish relations are strained. The Polish minority in southeastern Lithuania (~7% of population, heavily concentrated in Vilnius and Šalčininkai regions) complains of cultural discrimination, such as restrictions on Polish-language education, property restitution disputes, and removal of Polish signage.</p>
    <p><strong>Early Warming and Sudden Rupture (1992)</strong></p>
    <p>January–August 1992: Lithuanian leader Vytautas Landsbergis meets Polish officials to ease tensions. Initiatives include a bilateral commission on minority rights and the expansion of minority-language schools.</p>
    <p>September 1992: Both countries sign a declaration of friendship, with promises to move towards an official treaty in the immediate future.</p>
    <p><strong>The Trigger: November 17, 1992</strong></p>
    <p>A Tupolev Tu-154 carrying Polish President Lech Wałęsa, Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski, and 13 high-ranking officials crashes near the Lithuanian town of Druskininkai. All 87 on board are killed.</p>
    <p>Lithuanian authorities suggest heavy fog and pilot error. However, a leaked preliminary report mentions a heat signature consistent with a surface-to-air missile.</p>
    <p>The public reaction in Poland is gigantic, as massive vigils, protests are staged amidst a growing suspicion of foul play. Nationalist newspapers claim deliberate sabotage by Lithuanian hardliners or ex-Soviet elements sympathetic to Vilnius.</p>
    <p><strong>Breakdown of Relations and Militarization (1992–1993)</strong></p>
    <p>Late November 1992:</p>
    <p>The Polish military puts its air force on alert and mobilizes a large percentage of its troops.</p>
    <p>Lithuania mobilizes border guards and suspends some civil liberties in Šalčininkai and Vilnius counties.</p>
    <p>Poland demands an international investigation and allows NATO observers in Warsaw. Reports on the nature of the crash are inconclusive, with foul play not ruled out as a factor.</p>
    <p>December 1992:</p>
    <p>On the night of December 8, 1992, Poland unilaterally militarizes the Suwalki Corridor, deploying two mechanized brigades and creating a de facto blockade of Lithuanian-Polish land trade. Only a limited amount of people and goods are allowed through, although the Lithuania port of Klaipeda remains open.</p>
    <p>Polish intelligence begins covertly supplying small arms to ethnic Polish self-defense units in Lithuania’s southeast who have formed as a response to the Lithuanian crackdown, modeled after WWII-era Armia Krajowa tactics.</p>
    <p>January 1993:</p>
    <p>Lithuania arrests several Polish community leaders for “illegal paramilitary organization.”</p>
    <p>Martial law is declared in Vilnius and surrounding counties. Polish language newspapers are shuttered. Polish school boards are dissolved. The government schedules a national referendum on citizenship.</p>
    <p><strong>Escalation via Latvia (1993)</strong></p>
    <p>February 3, 1993:</p>
    <p>3,000 ethnic Polish partisans from Daugavpils (Latvia), claiming to seek asylum or transit to Poland, attempt to cross into Lithuania via the Smėlynė border crossing. The partisans refuse to surrender their weapons, citing their fear of not being able to respond to Lithuanian threats under martial law.</p>
    <p>Lithuanian border guards deny entry. After a tense 9-hour standoff, gunfire breaks out. 47 partisans are killed, and 23 Lithuanian troops also die.</p>
    <p>Poland’s Sejm votes 454-6 to declare the incident an “act of aggression.” Polish protesters storm the Lithuanian embassy in Warsaw.</p>
    <p><strong>Lightning War: "Operation Eagle’s Right" (February 1993)</strong></p>
    <p>February 3-7</p>
    <p>Lithuania secretly negotiates with Russia and Belarus on a plan to invade Lithuania and avoid larger regional conflict. Despite the bad blood between Poland and Russia, the two countries use the issue of Russian troops still stationed in Poland as a bargaining chip, with Russia agreeing to a timely withdrawal in exchange for military cooperation.</p>
    <p>February 8, 1993 – Day 1:</p>
    <p>04:00 AM: Poland launches a multi-front assault into southern and central Lithuania. Troops advance from Suwałki into Lazdijai, Druskininkai, and Marijampolė.</p>
    <p>Simultaneously, Belarusian mechanized units enter Lithuania from the east, targeting Švenčionys and Visaginas.</p>
    <p>Russian Spetsnaz in unmarked uniforms land behind enemy lines and sabotage Lithuanian radar and air defense systems from within.</p>
    <p>February 9, 1993 – Day 2:</p>
    <p>Vilnius is encircled by Polish and Belarusian forces. Lithuania’s 1st Mechanized Infantry Brigade attempts to break out, but is cut off near Trakai.</p>
    <p>10:30 PM: Acting President Algirdas Brazauskas signs a conditional ceasefire and agrees to terms of occupation to avoid mass civilian casualties.</p>
    <p>February 10, 1993:</p>
    <p>Polish troops secure Vilnius, Šalčininkai, and Švenčionys. A military governor is installed in the occupied zone. The remaining holdouts of the Lithuanian government completely capitulate, and a temporary government is established in Kaunas.</p>
    <p><strong>International Response (1993–1994)</strong></p>
    <p>February–April 1993:</p>
    <p>UN General Assembly Resolution 48/121 condemns the invasion 142–6. Poland, Russia, Belarus, North Korea, Cuba, and Serbia vote against.</p>
    <p>EC freezes Polish financial aid and suspends all plans for accession talks.</p>
    <p>The U.S. halts arms sales to Poland and suspends diplomatic visits, placing several sectors of their economy under heavy sanctions.</p>
    <p>May 1993:</p>
    <p>Poland forms a regional bloc with Belarus and Ukraine (which remains neutral but friendly to Warsaw) under the Lublin Security Compact, allowing for joint military exercises and preferential trade agreements.</p>
    <p><strong>Stabilization and Referendum (1994–1996)</strong></p>
    <p>August 1994: Poland organizes an occupation administration with Polish and cooperative Lithuanian officials. The Polish language is restored in schools. All political activity is banned.</p>
    <p>May 1995: Under increasing international pressure, Poland agrees to supervised referendums in the occupied regions.</p>
    <p><strong>Referendum Details (October 1995):</strong></p>
    <p>Administered by: OSCE, monitored by Red Cross and neutral Swiss observers.</p>
    <p><strong>Ballot Options:</strong></p>
    <p>Join the Republic of Poland.</p>
    <p>Return to the Republic of Lithuania.</p>
    <p><strong>Results (official):</strong></p>
    <p>Alytus Country: 51% vote to join Poland.</p>
    <p>Vilnius country: 58% vote to join Poland.</p>
    <p>Švenčionys district municipality: 56% vote to join Poland.</p>
    <p>There are no irregularities noted in the ballot process, but many Lithuanians boycott the referendum.</p>
    <p><strong>Resolution and Aftermath (1996–Present)</strong></p>
    <p>March 1996: Treaty of Kraków signed.</p>
    <p>Alytus County, Vilnius Country, and Švenčionys district municipality are annexed by Poland.</p>
    <p>Lithuanians are guaranteed significant language and cultural autonomy in Polish territory.</p>
    <p>The border is demarcated and border posts are fully opened.</p>
    <p>June 1997: Lithuania joins NATO.</p>
    <p>After June 1997: Poland re-engages with the EU and NATO, but refuses to give up its claims in Lithuania.</p>
    <p>As relations between Poland and Russia cool, Ukraine becomes Poland’s foremost economic and military partner.</p>
    <p>The war permanently scars Lithuanian politics, fueling ethnic nationalism and distrust of Poland for over a generation.</p>
    <p>Polish revanchism is satisfied, and economic growth slowly resumes as Western governments and firms prove themselves eager to invest in the country.</p>

    <p>Adam Hartman checked his watch. It was 9:32, and his contact was supposed to show at 9:30. The fifth floor of the parking garage was dark and lifeless, and the winter wind sweeping through the concrete was chilling him to the bone. The whole cloak and dagger routine reeked of an effort to emulate the movies, to add artificial gravitas to what should’ve been a straightforward story. At least that was what he thought. Somewhere, in the back of his mind, he couldn’t shake the nagging feeling that the gravitas here was something real, something as concrete as the parking deck he was standing on.</p>
    <p>“Sorry, I’m late.”</p>
    <p>Adam looked into the darkness, where a man stared back at him. He was wearing a wide brimmed hat, pulled down across his forehead, and a massive pair of aviator sunglasses. A scarf obscured most of the lower half of his face, leaving little to complete the enigma. Twice before, Adam had met him, and twice before, the routine had been the exact same. There was no point trying to identify the source, at least not at the moment.</p>
    <p>“Well,” said Adam, puffing his chest out a bit, “you’re here. That’s what matters.”</p>
    <p>“Yeah,” said the man, “that’s what matters, isn’t it. Tell me, Adam, since our last visit, you watched To Sell a War, right? No problems finding a place to rent it?”</p>
    <p>“Yes, I watched it. It’s an interesting film, very revealing. But I still fail to see what your angle is. The story has been broken, and the people didn’t really care that much. It’s not a debated point anymore. Now, maybe that’s an indictment of our system; I don’t know. But what’s the point?”</p>
    <p>The man straightened his sunglasses. “Mr. Hartman, when I contacted you, did you really think that my plan was to regurgitate information that we already knew? Come on, now, I have a little more sense than that. When I told you that I was going to give you the scoop of a lifetime, I wasn’t just saying things for the sake of it. Work with me, Mr. Hartman, and I’ll lead you where you need to go.”</p>
    <p>Adam just stood there for a moment before regaining his composure. “Okay, I get it. So what do you have for me this time which is supposed to be so great? Is this the legendary scoop that I’ve been hearing so much of?”</p>
    <p>The man just smiled, revealing his teeth. Even in the darkness, Adam could tell that he was seeing smugness of a rare caliber. The man was out for vengeance.</p>
    <p>“You’ve seen All the President’s Men. I mean, hell, we’re living it right now. Do you remember what the film’s catchphrase was?”</p>
    <p>Adam blinked. “Follow the money.”</p>
    <p>The man nodded his head. “That’s right, follow the money. I’ve laid out a money trail for you to follow, and in the time since we last met, I’ve finally paved the last stone.”</p>
    <p>From his coat, the man produced a manilla folder, one practically bursting with papers. He started rifling through it, pulling out various papers as he went, all while talking to Adam. Behind the glasses, it was clear that he was staring Adam directly in the eyes.</p>
    <p>“Now, Mr. Hartman, you watched the documentary, you’ve talked with me before. You know half the story. The campaign that the Kuwaitis waged to get us to invade. Their dealings with American PR firms. Nayirah’s testimony on war crimes. Citizens For a Free Kuwait. All of this sounds familiar?”</p>
    <p>“Yeah, more or less. The Kuwaitis aren’t necessarily the good guys, and maybe did some very corrupt things. But what’s the point? I can’t bring charges against them.”</p>
    <p>“Because, Mr. Hartman, it’s only half of the story.”</p>
    <p>The man started handing individual papers, holding them up for Hartman to see before reinserting them into the folder, with robotic precision.</p>
    <p>“What if I told you that all of this, in Kuwait, was done hand in hand with the Bush campaign?” He held out a piece of paper. “Here, a backdoor channel between Kuwait City and Washington, well before the war began. All of the PR moves already planned out–the Kuwaitis didn’t even come up with half of their tricks organically–and ready to roll the moment that Iraqi tanks crossed the border.”</p>
    <p>The man flipped to another piece of paper. “But that wasn’t enough, of course. After the war, there was some quid pro quo: we pay you, we enrich your citizens, and in turn, you help us win the election. The brilliant part is that with all of the aid and treaties after the war, you could simply dump money into a sheikh’s bank account in the name of humanitarian rebuilding, and nobody would be the wiser. Are you getting the point?”</p>
    <p>Adam was focused on the papers. “Fascinating. But where’s the smoking gun? Is there even a smoking gun?”</p>
    <p>The man grimaced. “Oh, we’re getting to it. The Kuwaitis had moles in every Democratic campaign, and I have the bank files to prove it.” He pulled up a sheet that was clearly some sort of heavy financial document. “Jerry Brown, he got the honor of facing off with the president. Little did he know that his moves were completely compromised. How else do you think that Bush was able to stay so well ahead of him?”</p>
    <p>The man pulled out a photo, one Adam recognized, of Brown and a Kuwaiti diplomat talking to each other heatedly. “Why would Brown, a very smart guy, choose to go visit Kuwait after publicly calling Nayirah into question? Because he had a little devil whispering in his ear. Of course, the Kuwaitis orchestrated the whole dust-up, made sure that al-Fassam knew exactly what he was going to say to Jerry, made sure that the cameras caught it all.”</p>
    <p>Finally, the man held up one final piece of paper, a typewritten transcript of some sort. “But you said you wanted a smoking gun, right?”</p>
    <p>Adam nodded. “That would be ideal.”</p>
    <p>The man smirked. “November 9th, 1992. A transcript of a call made between George Herbet Walker Bush, President of the United States, and Ali Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah, Kuwaiti Minister of Defense. The president thanks Kuwait for its generous cooperation in helping secure his victory, and the minister promises that if the country can be of help in the future, they will commit similar actions.” He paused before restarting.</p>
    <p>“If you want your smoking gun, there it is. Just know that I went through a whole lot of trouble to get this.”</p>
    <p>He held out the manilla folder, and Adam took it from him. Inside were records, photocopies, transcripts, and everything else needed for a paper trail of extreme proportions. The man just stood there, patiently. After a moment of browsing, Adam looked back at him, an inquisitive look on his face.</p>
    <p>“So, what comes next?”</p>
    <p>“Mr. Hartman, you’re going to write a story about it, one of the greatest stories ever written. You’re a hell of a journalist, and now that you have the sources, all you need to do is write.”</p>
    <p>“Fair, fair.” Adam stood there for a few seconds, thinking. “Is this our final time meeting?”</p>
    <p>“Yes,” the man said, “my work here is done. I would hope that you don’t need to meet me again.”</p>
    <p>“But what about your identity? Woodward and Bernstein knew their guy. Who are you?”</p>
    <p>“Oh, you already know who I am. You don’t know that you know it, but in fact, you do.”</p>
    <p>“Will I ever know?”</p>
    <p>“Maybe.”</p>
    <p>And with that, as Adam stood there holding the folder, the man walked back into the darkness of the parking garage, blending into the shadows until he wasn’t there anymore.</p>

    <p>[Audience claps politely. The camera pans to Bush, who is seated stiffly next to a large plastic fish and a spinning wheel labeled “運命の回転” (Wheel of Fate)]</p>
    <p>Host (to Bush) 「ジョージさん、コンニチハ！ジャパニーズ・テレビ、ハジメテ？」 ("Mr. George, hello! First time on Japanese TV?")</p>
    <p>George Bush (tight smile) "Second, actually. I, uh, appeared on Tetsuko Kuroyanagi’s show the other night. You know, my term is ending here in a few weeks, so I thought that it would be good for me to branch out into some more media. Now, I was told this would be a political interview."</p>
    <p>Host (grinning) 「ノー・プロブレム、政治ノ話、あとデス！最初は“バラエティ入門クイズ”デス！」 ("No problem, politics come later! First, let’s do the Variety Show Entry Quiz!")</p>

    <p>“バラエティ入門クイズ” (Variety Show Entry Quiz)</p>

    <p>Host 「ルールはカンタン。質問に正解したらオヤツゲット、間違えたら罰ゲームね！」 ("Simple rules. Correct answer = snack. Wrong answer = punishment game.")</p>

    <p>Translator (off-screen, struggling) "He says… he prefers not to, but will do a short version."</p>
    <p>[Cue dramatic drum music. Bush climbs onto the balance beam. He takes a step, then another, feeling confident. As he takes another one, a foam hand smacks him into the slime pool. The audience erupts in cheers and chants: “ブッシュ！ブッシュ！”]</p>
    <p>[Bush crawls out of the slime pool, helped by the show’s aides. Although he’s drenched in slime, he otherwise looks to be in fine condition.]</p>

    <p>[Bush is sat down for a “one-on-one” under the spotlight, right across from the host. The host asks him a question about cooperation between Japan and the U.S. in the Pacific ocean.

    <p style="text-align:left;">November 4, 2015<br>Mercedes Carrera</p>
    <p>At this point in time, the name Blood Moon is one that’s automatically expected to receive applause in the video game world. Just like all of the true greats–Super Mario Bros, Doom, Daikatana, Bioshock–Blood Moon’s greatness is taken as a given fact. But in the eighth generation of video game consoles, with the latest from Xbox and Sega boasting ever-more-fluid controls and ever-more-realistic graphics, the time has come to answer a pivotal question: in the year 2015, is Blood Moon still one of the best video games ever made?</p>
    <p>Before we dive into the gameplay, let’s take a moment to look at the game’s history, because it is fascinating. The game has two lead writers, Victoria Paulson and Jerry Brown. Yes, you read that correctly: Jerry Brown, the presidential candidate, was one of the lead writers on the game and served as its de facto producer, even if that title was officially held by Martin Hollis. You see, after his loss in the 1992 election, Jerry moved to Japan for the second time. While he was there, he finished an autobiography that he had been working on for years, and when he released it, it made bank. Overnight, he went from normal rich to stupid rich. Now, what do you do when you have a lot of money and a lot of time and you live in Japan? You get with Nintendo, obviously.</p>
    <p>In 1997, British video game developer Rare had partnered with Ninetendo and released Goldeneye 007. The game was a smash hit, selling millions of copies and defining the N64, and everyone wanted to know what Rare had coming next. At this exact same time, Jerry had contacted Nintendo headquarters with an idea for a video game: he had written an entire script and had come up with the basic ideas of gameplay, even though he was almost computer illiterate. But here’s the thing: as crazy as it sounds, by all accounts, Jerry’s ideas were brilliant right off the bat. So, Nintendo partnered him with Rare and tried to see if they could bang out a video game together using his script and his ideas. The result is what we now know and love as Blood Moon.</p>
    <p>The game takes place in 1945, on a small Japanese island meant to resemble Okinawa. The game has two protagonists, who swap perspectives every level. The first protagonist, Sergeant Brun, is an American soldier with a mysterious terminal illness which he believes can only be cured by reaching a Shinto shrine located deep in the island’s interior. Brun’s levels consist of him tearing through the island, trying to get closer to the shrine, even as his antagonist, Imperial Japanese Captain Busshu, tries to stop him. The second protagonist, a villager only known as Miyamoto, is in the opposite situation: impressed into the Japanese army, his only goal is to fight off the Americans and protect the shrine, which he holds sacred. The game ends with a final battle between the two at the shrine, and depending on your performance as either Brun or Miyamoto, you either play as one and kill the other or, if you’ve played the game carefully, unlock a secret third ending where the two of them team up.</p>
    <p>Okay, so the plot sounds pretty interesting. But what about the actual gameplay nowadays? Just like Goldeneye, it’s a shooter (with some stabbing elements, too) based on accuracy, with no ability to jump. Unlike Goldeneye, though, whose aiming was enough to give anyone fits if they were in the wrong position (we shan’t even speak of Oddjob), Blood Moon’s gunplay is on a whole different level, with insanely clean aiming and bullets that really feel like they pack a punch when they hit an enemy. Although the game’s movement limits you somewhat, and the physics can be a bit lacking, you’re set up to shoot and hack through hordes of Japanese and American troops in a way that feels entertaining even in a world where Medal of Honor releases a shiny new fps every year. The game’s artificial intelligence, with enemies making calculated decisions instead of chasing after you aimlessly, was groundbreaking at the time and still presents an interesting puzzle today. The guns are also varied to the point of being interesting, but not so large in scope that they needlessly overlap with each other, creating fun questions of rock-paper-scissors to decide how you want to start blasting.</p>
    <p>If the gameplay still holds up in 2015, then what about the graphics? The answer is… less satisfactory. To be sure, the game looks fantastic for something from 2000. There’s dynamic lighting, varied textures, good animations, the whole shebang. There’s also a whole bunch of goodies when it comes to the soundtrack and the cutscenes; you really feel like you’re listening to actual humans in a war instead of pixels on a screen (to say nothing of the score… my God, what a score). Still, the frame rate is inconsistent, and gives a player headaches. I had to stop the game multiple times to adjust to the shifting framerate, which was a less than fun experience. You can really tell that this game pushed the N64 to its limits, and a remake in 2012 effectively solved all of the framerate problems by virtue of better technology. And as good as the graphics are for the time… look, it’s 2015. Even the worst graphical games today absolutely blow it out of the water, even if the artistic direction still makes it pleasing to look at. Technology is just a losing battle, sadly.</p>
    <p>So, to answer the question of whether Blood Moon holds up, the answer is an empathetic yes–with caveats. In the 15 years since, few shooters have even come close to matching its gameplay, with a level of control which is breathtaking considering the context and still impressive even when judged against the newest fps on the market. However, anyone expecting to be graphically blown away by a game from 2000 is, understandably, going to be disappointed. Until Blood Moon: Beam of the Moon comes out (Rare currently predicts a 2017 release date, so we’ll see), I can confidently say that it’s still the cornerstone of the series, and a vital piece of video game history.</p>

    <p style="text-align:left;">September 6th 2012: How a New Fad Turned This Failed Presidential Candidate into “Tree Jesus”. </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">By Ben Armstrong-Lam, Oakland Speaks</p>
    <p>On this exact day twenty years ago, Jerry Brown, the former governor of California turned improbable Democratic nominee, filmed himself in the Amazon Rainforest pleading for the preservation of the environment with the infamous phrase “mourn our wood,” mimicking the stretched arms the Christ The Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro. While many were touched by his passion for preserving the environment, critics likened him to an airheaded “Tree Jesus” with little insight into climate beyond performative acts.</p>
    <p>With West Coast forest fires reaching a record new high this year, young people all over the world took matters into their own hands by “mourning”, mimicking Governor Brown’s pose in front of any tree they could find, and guarding the tree as a “Tree Jesus” with these posts appearing all over YouTube, Twitter and other online platforms.</p>
    <p>After his political career, Brown has maintained a mostly low profile at his ranch in Colusa County. While it's unlikely that he will be pursuing a return to politics anytime soon, a “Tree Jesus” write-in movement for the 2012 election has emerged due to the popularity of his infamous tree pose. The movement is not limited to the online world, with “Mass Jesus” sessions advertised through posters all over population centres such as Los Angeles, Detroit, and New York.</p>
    <p>While the movement mirrors the controversial KONY 2012 movement via its use of often intentionally sloppy posters to advertise events, “Mourning” lies in an ethical gray area as the participating are generally doing what they promised, guarding trees in the style of Jesus. Oddly enough, the normally less-than-media-shy Brown has made no public comment on the phenomenon as of the time of this article’s publication, with his wife, Anne Gust, telling reporters that Brown was occupied with business at a local park when reached for a statement.</p>

    <p><b>Operation Moonbeam, based on real events which were partially fictionalized for narrative purposes, is directed by David Fincher and stars Brad Pitt, Carrie-Ann Moss, David Strathairn, and Willem Dafoe. It was 2007’s third highest-grossing film, earning critical acclaim and winning Dafoe his first Academy Award for his portrayal of former presidential candidate Jerry Brown.</b></p>
    <p>SCRIPT EXCERPT— "Operation Moonbeam"</p>
    <p>INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS–OPS ROOM–LANGLEY–NIGHT</p>
    <p>Dim lights. A wall of monitors shows satellite imagery over Venezuela. Two agents stand over a table cluttered with classified reports, stills of the captured spy, and redacted intel. The air is heavy.</p>
    <p>AGENT NINA PONCZEK (Moss): sharp, methodical, the agency’s political conduit. Relatively young, but highly competent. She possesses an icy demeanor, but can sometimes get frustrated.</p>
    <p>AGENT RICHARD DONOVAN (Strathairn): field-hardened, blunt, war-room strategist. He’s seen it all, but still possesses a touch of compassion which he occasionally lets shine through.</p>
    <p>NINA scans a communique printout.</p>
    <p>NINA<br>(quietly)<br>They moved him again. Off the books. Last ping was two hours outside Barinas. He’s off the grid now.</p>
    <p>DONOVAN<br>(sighs, rubbing his temple)<br>Chávez won’t admit he has him. Which means we can’t acknowledge we’re trying to get him back.</p>
    <p>NINA<br>State’s hands are tied. Pentagon’s waiting for a provocation that won’t come. White House doesn’t consider him worth sacrificing anything over. We’re going to lose Wells in a fog of denials.</p>
    <p>DONOVAN slaps a folder shut, frustrated.</p>
    <p>DONOVAN<br>We trained the guy to operate invisible. Now we’re praying someone notices he’s missing.</p>
    <p>(A beat)</p>
    <p>NINA<br>We have no leverage. No backchannel. Nobody in Caracas we can trust. Those were all Wells’ people.</p>
    <p>DONOVAN squints at an old contact sheet, eyes narrowing. One name at the bottom stands out.</p>
    <p>DONOVAN<br>Wait. What about Jerry Brown?</p>
    <p>NINA freezes. Recognition. Disbelief.</p>
    <p>NINA<br>You’re joking. Jerry? He’s been off the grid since Bush. Last I heard he was in the Redwoods tending to his rock garden.</p>
    <p>DONOVAN<br>He met Chávez in ’92, back when Chávez was still just a hothead paratrooper. He went to Venezuela for some campaign thing and met him in prison after the failed coup. Apparently, the two have sent a few letters back and forth. That’s a longer relationship than anyone we’ve got now.</p>
    <p>NINA<br>That was twelve years ago. You think Chávez even remembers Jerry Brown the person, and not Jerry Brown the random American behind a few letters?</p>
    <p>DONOVAN<br>I think Chávez remembers everyone who treated him like a human being before he became a symbol. If you’ve got anyone else, even one other person, I’d love to hear it.</p>
    <p>(They look at each other. A reluctant agreement)</p>
    <p>NINA<br>You know he’s going to make us beg.</p>
    <p>DONOVAN<br>So let’s start now.</p>
    <p>EXT. CALIFORNIA REDWOODS – SUNRISE</p>
    <p>A helicopter shot over a remote compound deep in the forest. Wind softly blows through the trees. Silence. Stillness. Isolation.</p>
    <p>INT. MEDITATION ROOM–JERRY BROWN’S COMPOUND</p>
    <p>JERRY BROWN (60s), short hair, heavily balding, weathered face. Former governor. Once a presidential candidate, now a man unbothered by headlines. He sits in lotus position, eyes closed, incense drifting.</p>
    <p>A small GONG chimes gently. He breathes deeply. Then—</p>
    <p>SLAM. The wooden door swings open.</p>
    <p>NINA (O.S.)<br>Sorry to kill your zen, Governor.</p>
    <p>JERRY opens one eye. He doesn’t move.</p>
    <p>JERRY<br>If it wasn’t urgent, you’d be sending a courier. If it was critical, if I had somehow run afoul of our glorious state apparatus, I’d be dead already. So what’s happening?</p>
    <p>GERALD (O.S.)<br>At the moment, Governor, we’re somewhere in between "historic" and "catastrophic."</p>
    <p>They enter, both in travel-wrinkled suits. NINA carries a sealed folder, with “CIA” clearly visible on the outside.</p>
    <p>JERRY<br>Langley must be desperate if they’re knocking on my door. I am, in practical terms, a nobody. Something must have gone really wrong.</p>
    <p>NINA<br>It has.</p>
    <p>She hands him the file. He flips it open. Sees a grainy image: WELLS, blindfolded in a windowless room.</p>
    <p>JERRY<br>(quietly)<br>Who’s this?</p>
    <p>NINA<br>Agent Wells. One of the CIA’s finest men. Currently imprisoned by Hugo Chavez.</p>
    <p>DONOVAN<br>Not talking. That’s the problem.</p>
    <p>NINA<br>You had a visit with him in ‘92. One meeting. One conversation. That’s more than anyone else in our Rolodex. According to our files–not some nobody’s files, real CIA files–you’ve kept up with him ever since, on and off.</p>
    <p>JERRY<br>(smiling thinly)<br>Christ. I told that bastard he had eyes like a hawk. He said, “And you have the smile of a man who’s already buried the truth.” I called bullshit at the time, but as I think about it, he might have really been onto something.</p>
    <p>A long pause. JERRY sets the folder down.</p>
    <p>JERRY (CONT'D)<br>You don’t want diplomacy. You want deniability.</p>
    <p>DONOVAN<br>We want Wells back. That’s it. No press. No leaks. You fly in, make contact, feel it out. Any points that you’ve banked with Chavez, with the Venezuelans, now’s the time to cash them in. You’re a public figure in the United States of America. Your country needs you.</p>
    <p>NINA<br>You're the only man in America who might get an honest answer from him.</p>
    <p>JERRY exhales slowly. Another long beat. He closes his eyes, says a few words under his breath, and reopens them. He stands up, still limber, moving into a relaxed standing position with grace.</p>
    <p>JERRY<br>Fine. But I’m doing this because I want to, out of the goodness and pure graciousness of my heart.</p>
    <p>DONOVAN<br>Of course, Governor. You’re a good man. I’ve read about you and Mother Teresa.</p>
    <p>JERRY<br>If I get shot, I want it on record that I was dragged out of my very comfortable and isolated house by two CIA bureaucrats in cheap suits. You guys could stand to visit a tailor, try some pinstripes instead of this boring black.</p>
    <p>He exits the meditation room, walking to the kitchen and pulling out a passport from one of the drawers.</p>
    <p>NINA (half-smiling)<br>It’s been renewed?</p>
    <p>JERRY<br>Of course it’s been renewed. What, just because I’m not always in public means that I’m some kind of hermit? I still have money and like to travel, you know.</p>
    <p>NINA and DONOVAN blink for a second, caught off guard.</p>
    <p>JERRY<br>Let’s go save your spy.</p>
    <p>SMASH TO BLACK.</p>

<p>the former party official</p>
<p>the former mover of things</p>
<p>now just a man</p>
<p>the order of lenin medal sits proudly on his shelf</p>
<p>the calendar is pioneer-themed</p>
<p>the house drips red like an open wound</p>
<p>ivan ivanovich only cares a little bit</p>
<p>he reads the morning paper</p>
<p>a monument is going down in luhansk</p>
<p>nobody there seems to care</p>
<p>not even a little bit</p>
<p>later he walks outside</p>
<p>the air is hot</p>
<p>the sky is a messy blue like a smeared blueberry</p>
<p>the beach feels coarse beneath his feet</p>
<p>so he waits there</p>
<p>and his daughter approaches him</p>
<p>she has taken the bus from simferopol to come see him</p>
<p>irina ivanevna is happy to see her father</p>
<p>for him</p>
<p>25 years of change</p>

              <h2> Patrick Reaffirms NATO Commitment in Riga </h2>
				<p style="text-align: left">Associated Press</p>
				<p style="text-align: left">July 21, 2025</p>
				<p><b>RIGA —</b> President Deval Patrick concluded his three-day tour of the Baltic states today with a solemn address at the Freedom Monument in Riga. Facing a crowd of thousands, the President sought to reassure his Eastern European allies of continued American support amidst rising tensions on the Russian border, framing the current geopolitical struggle, pundits have noted, as a continuation of the fights for democracy that defined the late 20th century.</p>
				<p>In a moment of candor during the subsequent press conference with the Latvian Prime Minister, Aivars Lembergs, President Patrick took a moment to reflect on the post-Cold War era and the divergent paths history has taken since the collapse of the Soviet Union. When asked about the rising tide of cynicism in Western democracies, Patrick offered a surprising historical allusion to the election of 1992.</p>
				<p>”I am reminded often of, uh, the 1992 election back home,” Patrick said, leaning over the lectern. “We had a nominee then, Governor Jerry Brown, who spoke with great passion about a ‘broken system’ and the need to radically dismantle the establishment. Well, he didn’t win. The country wasn’t ready for that kind of disruption, and um, perhaps rightly so. But standing here, looking at the fragility of freedom, one has to wonder… if his diagnosis of our civic health was simply three decades ahead of its time. We cannot let our institutions rot from the inside while we guard the walls on the outside.”</p>
				<p>The reference to the failed 1992 Democratic nominee caught attention from members of the press pool. While Brown receded into political obscurity following his defeat, President Patrick’s invocation of his “broken system” rhetoric suggests his administration is aware of the domestic discontent bubbling back home, even as it projects strength abroad.</p>

		<h2>FOR THE LAST TIME, THESE CHARACTERS ARE ANTHROPOMORPHIC REPRESENTATIONS OF COUNTRIES, BUT THEY STILL FUNCTION AS INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE WITH NAMES. MARTINA=CZECHIA, ZOFIA=POLAND, AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. I WILL NOT BE ANSWERING THIS QUESTION AGAIN.</h2>
        <p>The dark waters of the Black Sea flashed in a hundred different shades of darkness as Valentina and Ophelia walked along the Sochi beachfront, hand in hand. Snow was lightly falling, blanketing the beach city in an ethereal white covering.</p>

		<p>As the two of them walked together, Valentina looked at Ophelia and blushed. The American woman was so beautiful, so powerful, with crimson red lipstick and thick black makeup that provided an alluring edge to her soft green eyes, all-American pigtails and relaxed demeanor. She was innocent and dangerous, loud and careful, confident and bashful. Ophelia truly was everything America represented: a big bundle of contradictions wrapped up into something breathtakingly stunning.</p>

		<p>As Valentina was smiling to herself, Ophelia took the chance to look at her and blushed even harder. The Russian woman was tall and strong, with long ballerina legs and a graceful bearing. She looked at Valentina and saw how she had been broken, hurt so badly by so many people, her alabaster white skin traced with centuries worth of pale scars. But she stood straight: her blonde hair shone brightly against the snow, her face, seemingly chiseled from stone, looked beautifully strong rather than utterly cruel, and her full lips curled upward with the hint of a smile.</p>

		<p>“You are a strong and beautiful woman, you know that?” asked Valentina, interrupting Ophelia’s thoughts.</p>

		<p>Ophelia blushed even harder, her face becoming as red as the old Soviet Union’s flag. “Aww, Valentina, you’re so nice! You don’t have to say all of these pleasantries about me just to get on my good side. I already love you!” She planted a kiss on the side of Valentina’s face, her crimson lipstick leaving a bright stain. Valentina didn’t wipe it off.</p>

		<p>The two of them walked some more as the snow grew thicker and thicker, their boots leaving prints that were quickly swallowed up. Ophelia shivered. “Brr, how are you Russians able to live in this weather? Sochi isn’t even that cold compared to other cities — I’d be freezing to death if we were in Murmansk.”</p>

		<p>Valentina laughed, a big, hearty sound that made Ophelia’s heart sing. “You Americans, you have misconceptions about us. We hate the cold! Life in winter is very hard. We just… adjust. Bundle up tighter.”</p>

		<p>Ophelia smiled. “That sounds so nice. But tell me, what’s the proper etiquette for a girl’s date out in the snow? Do you even have hot chocolate?”</p>

		<p>“It is very rare,” responded Valentina. “Usually, we just drink tea or warm ourselves by the fire. But really, when two people love each other, they focus on staying warm together.”</p>

		<p>“Oh,” asked Ophelia, raising an eyebrow, “and how do you like to stay warm?” </p>

		<p>Valentina smiled warmly. “I have apartment close by. We should go there, get out of this cold.”</p>

		<p>“I love the sound of that,” said Ophelia. “Lead the way!”</p>

		<p>The women walked through the snow until they arrived at Valentina’s apartment. On the surface, it was a normal five-story Khrushchevka. But when they stepped inside, Ophelia was taken aback at how charming it was. It was lit with candles, with books — Pushkin, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy — stacked up everywhere and ornamental carpets lining the walls. Ophelia walked over to a picture of Valentina with two other girls, taken in the summertime. Valentina was in the middle, with a girl wearing a white-and-red swimsuit on the left and a girl wearing a yellow-and-blue swimsuit on the right.</p>

		<p>“What’s this,” Ophelia asked, “competition?”</p>

		<p>Valentina just laughed again. “It’s not romantic. These women are my sisters. Ulyana is on the left and Oksana is on the right.”</p>

		<p>“I would love to meet them someday.”</p>

		<p>“Maybe, maybe.” Valentina sat down on her couch, and Ophelia moved to sit beside her. “These things about family make me… feel scared. Our relationship. I don’t know what we are.”</p>

		<p>Ophelia thought back on it. She thought about how she and Valentina had hated each other during that one super-left phase Valentina had gone through. How their friends Jerry and Boris had reintroduced them to each other. How they had grown over the past few years.</p>

		<p>Valentina jumped in front of Ophelia’s train of thought. “We were enemies, then friends. Now we are lovers. But what comes next?”</p>

		<p>Ophelia stroked Valentina’s hand carefully. “Are you ready to use the m-word?”</p>

		<p>Valentina looked confused. “My English is not so good, Ophelia. Which ‘m’ word?”</p>

		<p>“Marriage,” Ophelia said. “The two of us entwined in eternal companionship, bound by the power of love.”</p>

		<p>Valentina looked worried. “Ophelia, you’ve been in serious relationships before. That British girl, the one you said you had a ‘special relationship’ with. That Israeli girl you were engaged to before you broke up. How am I different?”</p>

		<p>Ophelia looked at Valentina deep in her icy blue eyes. “Because you’re not like the other girls. You’re stronger, smarter. But above all else, it is your soul, your beautiful soul, which is special. Together, we can travel the world, do whatever we please.” She took Valentina’s hands in hers. “We can build a life together.”</p>

		<p>Valentina looked at her lovingly. “Am I really so special? I feel so… weak sometimes. Like I cannot do it.”</p>

		<p>“No,” said Ophelia, “you’re beautiful the way you are.” She squeezed Valentina’s hands. “You’re the strongest person I know.”</p>

		<p>Valentina leaned in closer. “Oh, I cannot hide it. I love you, my American darling.” </p>

		<p>The two women drew closer together, about to share a tender moment, when suddenly a terrible racket started outside, and they heard the sound of people yelling at each other. Going up to the window, Ophelia could see the familiar faces of Ana the Serbian, Farah the Bosniak, and Marta the Croatian out in the snow, throwing snowballs at each other with violent intent. First, Farah and Marta were teaming up on Ana, before Marta switched sides, as the girls hollered with delight at the scene they were making, paying no attention to their surroundings as snowballs went whizzing everywhere.</p>

		<p>Ophelia opened the window and called out, “Hey, knock it off, kids! We’re trying to get some peace and quiet!”</p>

		<p>The three girls hid their snowballs behind their backs and innocently looked back at Ophelia. “What do you mean?” yelled Ana. “There’s nothing to see here!”</p>

		<p>Valentina came up to the window and gave the girls a stern look. “Listen up, ladies. Ophelia and I are together now. She’s too busy to worry about little people like you. We’d appreciate some quiet, so please, be silent!”</p>

		<p>The girls stared down, ashamed. They went back to throwing snowballs at each other, but tried their best to remain quiet.</p>

		<p>Ophelia and Valentina just laughed and closed the window. They walked back to the couch, hand in hand, and Valentina laid her head on Ophelia’s shoulder as they sat together in comfortable silence, watching the snow fall outside through the candlelit window.</p>

		<p>“This is perfect,” Ophelia whispered.</p>

		<p>“Yes,” Valentina agreed, wrapping her arms around her love. “This is exactly where I want to be.”</p>

		<p>They sat together like that for a few hours, talking about their future, sharing their hopes and dreams, until eventually, they both fell asleep in each other’s arms — warm, safe, and deeply in love.</p>`

			<p>In typical Kinnock form, the Prime Minister’s Ambassador to the United States, Christopher Meyer, has allegedly banned the phrase “Special Relationship” from the British Embassy in Washington D.C, on the grounds of it being <b>“hackneyed nonsense.”</b></p>

			<p>This is keeping with a long line with Mr. Kinnock’s infamous anti-Americanism over the years, following his ascendancy to Number 10. After this trait first revealed itself after President Bush’s decisive decision to send arms to the Bosniaks and prevent a genocide, which Prime Minister Kinnock called “a regrettable escalation” following the strikes on the Serbians when they attempted to block the arms deal, he and Bush have openly sniped at each other for years.</p>

			<p>Privately, it’s known that Prime Minister Kinnock referred to <span class=”sun-highlight”>“the sudden end of the Special Relationship”</span> after the U.S. voted to lift the Bosnian arms embargo against British and French wishes, believing that German Chancellor Waigel’s willingness to cooperate with President Bush made them better partners for the special relationship– destroying over a century of close bonds.</p>

			<p>Leader of the opposition Peter Lilley called Meyer’s ban <i>“an absolute disgrace… that shows how far from the days of Thatcher and Reagan we’ve fallen. If Britain is to remain a global actor, it needs to maintain a close relationship with the sole superpower. The Prime Minister is destroying Britain’s credibility on the global stage.”</i></p>

			<p>Unfortunately, what else can we expect from the most anti-American Prime Minister since Lord Frederick North? From their first meeting in June 1992, where Kinnock emasculated the entire nation with a pink-colored tie, or the way he humiliated Britain on the global stage with the bizarre manner in which he ate a corned beef sandwich at the G7 in front of six other world leaders, his off-the-rails behavior has made it clear that British prestige is at risk of destruction.</p>

			<p style="font-weight: bold; border-top: 2px solid #ec1c24; padding-top: 10px;">We at the Sun hope that for the future of British respectability, Mr. Kinnock does the right thing and calls for a general election soon.</p>

    <h2><b>Brown Trades Bilateral Meetings for Sandals and Skis</b></h2>
    <p style="text-align:left;">Shannon Eddy</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">The Burlington Free Press</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">January 9, 1995</p>
    <p>In diplomatic history, there’s one single rule: what works works. Therefore, diplomatic efforts that have a perception of being extremely serious, such as the fabled Realpolitik, may also accommodate room for equally meaningful actions, even if these actions may not outwardly seem like much. Consider ping pong diplomacy, when the U.S. table tennis team became the first official American visitors to communist China. Soon, Nixon himself was visiting the Great Wall.</p><br>

    <p>Now, in a post-Cold War era which is still struggling to define itself, a new diplomacy may have emerged: vacation diplomacy. Although Jerry Brown came into office having made Western Europe the focal point of his foreign policy during campaigning season, once in office, the obvious power black hole left by the collapse of the Soviet Union prompted him to declare “the era of Eurocentrism is over” in his 1994 State of the Union address, leading to fury from Europe’s ambassadors and state departments. In his official capacity as president, Brown has done very little to counter this notion, with many of his initiatives and international trips focusing on Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. In his unofficial capacity, though, Brown has completely changed Europe’s perception of him since the speech, swapping out red carpets and state dinners for beach chairs and a pair of skis.</p><br>

    <p>Presidential vacations are no new occurrence, dating back to the 1700s, although their nature has changed over the years from Franklin Roosevelt’s trips to Warm Springs to help his polio to Dwight Eisenhower’s driving range at Camp David. During his first year in office, Brown took an extremely low number of vacation days, only 18 (in contrast, Bush, his predecessor, averaged a whopping 128 days of vacation per year), spending them at Camp David and in Hawaii. However, a notable change occurred in his second year in office, in which his vacation days ballooned to 39, all but three of which he spent outside of the country, in Austria, Spain, and France. These vacations were no ordinary get-away-from-it-all vacations, either. Brown paid for all expenses except security out of pocket, and invited several European politicians to come visit him, if they please. These invitations have been a huge success: in Cannes, Brown spent a day lounging on the beach with British Prime Minister Kinnock before having brunch with French President Mitterand the next day.</p><br>

    <p>Of course, Brown has only spent a limited amount of time with heads of state. The real success has come with his availability to more minor officials, with whom he has a virtual revolving door. During a day skiing in Austria, he managed to fit in a visit with diplomats from Germany, Italy, Belgium, and Greece all in one single day. Even though his overall performance as president has been met with mixed grades from Europe, few can deny that his personal touch has greatly helped assuage concerns of a pivot away from the continent in the face of “the end of Eurocentrism.” Going forth into 1995, Brown seemingly plans to broaden his itinerary, with a trip to Polish beach resort Sopot and Ireland already on his schedule.</p><br>

    <p>How, though, is Brown able to balance his work life and his personal life? According to Neil Beckett, a personal aide of his, “the president is simply constructed differently than the average man.” Beckett claims that the president has “an extremely short recharge cycle,” which once finished, “allows him to mix a low-stress vacation environment with actually getting work done.” Beckett points out that this is far from the first time that Brown has let the bigger picture seep into his personal life, identifying his 1979 trip to Africa with then-girlfriend Linda Rondstadt as a public event which made national headlines. Although Brown largely fell out of the public eye in the mid-80s, Beckett says that he “is ready to stay in the limelight for as long as necessary, in the context of his vacations.”</p><br>

    <p>But has vacation diplomacy reaped actual rewards besides being a nice forum for Brown to talk to European leaders on their home turf? Several European diplomats emphatically say yes. One anonymous German diplomat points to discussions held with Brown during his stay in Spain as being absolutely crucial to providing the inertia necessary to help pass an energy treaty; a similar story exists with a Dutch diplomat in regards to an investment deal. Across the board, though, diplomats broadly appreciate Brown’s easiness to deal with, with several noting that he is able to strike an exact balance between facilitating serious discussion while also having fun, being able to discuss climate change in detail before he barrels into a double diamond slalom.</p><br>

    <p>If vacation diplomacy has been such a success, what type of future does it have? At the end of the day, there is still reason to think that in the wider scheme of international affairs, Brown’s vacations may not significantly move the needle, given his continued pivot away from Europe when it comes to actual policy implementation. However, it is impossible to ignore that for the time being, Brown has managed to invent a new form of diplomacy based around casualness rather than formal negotiations. In the future, we may very well see vacation diplomacy taking off to places beyond Europe. Perhaps in ten years, Brown’s upcoming state visit to South Africa, where he plans to simply meet with President Mandela before touring housing in Cape Town, will seem like a quaint choice instead of a safari.</p><br>

    <h2><b>Brazil Thrashes Germany 8-1, reaches World Cup final</b></h2>
    <p style="text-align:left;">By Karl Ford, sports writer </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">Published 5:57 PM CDT, July 8, 2014</p>
    <p>BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil (AP) — With star goalkeeper Manuel Neuer out injured, just about everyone in Germany knew it would be tough against Brazil.</p>
    <p>Nobody ever expected this.</p>
    <p>The Brazilians tore apart Germany’s porous defense time and time again Tuesday, giving their home fans a show as they inflicted an 8-1 beating, the largest margin of defeat at this stage in the history of the tournament.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to make the people happy… and wow, did we ever,” said Brazil defender David Luiz, who had scored in each of the last two matches before adding another goal in this match. “We thank all Brazilians.”</p>
    <p>The astounding scoreline is sure to overshadow Miroslav Klose’s record-setting 16th career World Cup goal. The strike, Germany’s only goal of the match, pushed Klose past Brazil great Ronaldo, who was at the Mineirao Stadium on Tuesday.</p>
    <p>Brazil will face either Argentina or the Netherlands on Sunday at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro with a chance to win for the sixth time.</p>
    <p>Brazil was represented by Neymar, the team’s key player and the poster boy for the World Cup. He scored four goals in the group stage, but only heated up as the tournament progressed, adding another three goals in the round of 16 and the quarterfinals. He added a hat trick in this game, thrilling the home fans.</p>
    <p>With German goalkeeper Neuer out with a strained hamstring and crucial defender Mats Hummels suspended for the game, many Germans went into the match with low expectations.</p>
    <p>The atmosphere at the start of the match was spine-tingling, but the euphoria of the yellow-shirted thousands soon boiled over as the Brazilians scored five goals in the first 30 minutes — four of them in a seven-minute span.</p>
    <p>“It is always crucial to stay calm, cool and courageous in facing Brazilian passion, and we just weren’t able to do it,” Germany coach Joachim Loew said.</p>
    <p>The loss matched Germany’s most-lopsided defeat ever, as fans throughout the country watched their television screens in silent horror while Brazil’s lead continued to balloon. </p>
    <p>“The responsibility for this result is the team’s,” Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said. “I was in charge, but they executed.”</p>
    <p>It was the most lopsided World Cup match since Portugal’s 7-0 win over North Korea in 2010.</p>
    <p>On Tuesday, with Neymar in top form, Brazil attacked from the start, potting their first goal 11 minutes in from Thiago Silva. But more would come as Germany’s defense buckled time and time again, with the game getting out of hand by halftime, with Brazil up 5-0. Even then, they added three more to the tally, with Germany’s sole goal coming from Klose in the 91st minute against a Brazilian team who seemed mentally uninvested in a match they had already practically won. </p>
    <p>The game was enjoyed by former American president George Bush, who was watching the game with former Brazilian president Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a personal acquaintance of his with whom Bush has worked closely together in the charitable field. Meanwhile, current Brazilian president Lula de Silva stayed home, though he offered the team congratulations on social media after the match.</p>
    <p>It’s the first time that Germany has allowed eight goals in a match since the 1954 World Cup, when they suffered an 8-3 defeat to Hungary before going on to beat the Hungarian team in the final. </p>
    <p>In previous World Cup semifinal matches, the largest margin of defeat was five goals, occurring on three occasions.</p>
    <p>“The Brazilian quality is very, very high,” Loew said. “This is not normal.”</p>`

   <h2><b>President Brown Delivers Historic Speech in Spanish at Miami Summit of the Americas</h2></b>
   <p style="text-align:left;">By Michael Gordon</p>
   <p style="text-align:left;">Staff Writer</p>
   <br><br>
   <p>MIAMI— In a moment that startled diplomats and delighted many Latin American leaders, President Jerry Brown delivered his opening remarks at the Summit of the Americas entirely in Spanish, becoming the first U.S. president in history to give a major public address in the language.</p>
<p>Speaking before the assembled presidents and prime ministers of 33 nations at the James L. Knight Center, Brown began with a warm greeting: “Hermanos y hermanas de las Américas, compartimos no solo comercio y política, sino también un destino común de cultura y humanidad.” (“Brothers and sisters of the Americas, we share not only trade and politics, but also a common destiny of culture and humanity.”)</p>
<p>The packed auditorium, filled with leaders from Mexico to Argentina, erupted into applause. Some officials exchanged smiles, while others leaned forward, visibly surprised by Brown’s fluency and ease. Their surprise continued unabated, as Brown continued speaking in Spanish for another 20 minutes before addressing numerous Spanish-speaking delegates in their mother tongue, speaking off script. Brown’s address marked a sharp departure from the precedent of past U.S. presidents, who have traditionally relied on interpreters when addressing Latin American audiences. “For the United States to show respect not only through policy but through language is extraordinary,” remarked former Colombian President César Gaviria afterward. “It signals a willingness to listen as well as speak.”</p>
<p>The White House confirmed that Brown had been preparing the speech for months. Though not previously known for his Spanish skills, Brown studied Latin extensively as a Jesuit seminarian in the 1950s and 1960s. “Latin gave me a foundation in Romance languages,” Brown explained at a press briefing following the summit session. “With excellent tutors here at the White House, I was able to build on that Latin past to speak directly to our neighbors in their own tongue. It’s only fair, considering how much they’ve had to bend over for us.”</p>
<p>While trade integration and economic reform dominated the summit’s agenda, Brown chose instead to frame his remarks around culture and shared identity. He called for the establishment of new academic exchanges between North and South America, the creation of bilingual education initiatives spanning from Canada to Chile, and greater cooperation among artists, musicians, and writers across the hemisphere.</p>
<p>“Commerce is important, but culture is enduring,” Brown said in Spanish. “If we know one another’s songs, poems, and histories, our negotiations will be more human, our disagreements more civil, and our unity more real.”</p>
<p>The president also pledged increased U.S. funding for language-learning programs that would allow both English and Spanish to flourish as “hemispheric languages of understanding.”</p>
<p>Reaction to Brown’s linguistic foray was divided back in Washington. Senator Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) called the decision “political theater” and warned against what he termed “pandering at the expense of American tradition.” Meanwhile, Representative José E. Serrano (D-N.Y.), one of the few Latino members of Congress, praised Brown for what he described as “a bold gesture of respect that will be remembered far longer than any tariff negotiation or arms treaty.”</p>
<p>Political analysts noted that Brown’s speech also carried domestic significance. With the Latino population in the United States continuing to grow, Brown’s embrace of Spanish underscored his administration’s efforts to appeal to immigrant communities and position cultural diplomacy as central to U.S. foreign policy.</p>
<p>As the day concluded, Brown was overheard joking with Uruguayan diplomats–in Spanish–that he would be spending the evening reviewing vocabulary before the next day’s meetings.</p>
<p>“I am still a student,” he admitted with a smile. “But in this hemisphere, we all must be students of one another.”</p>

					<p>Laura Ling and Euna Lee arrived back in the United States Wednesday morning with former President Jerry Brown, who flew to North Korea to negotiate their release after they were sentenced to a labor camp.</p>

					<p>Iain Clayton said Wednesday that his wife, Laura, told him through a telephone conversation that the North Koreans were willing to grant the two journalists amnesty if a high-level envoy, such as former President Brown, were willing to travel to Pyongyang.</p>

					<p>Some heavyweights were turned down by the North Koreans: former Vice President Jeanne Shaheen, a noted donor of the media outfit the women were working for when they were arrested, and former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Charles Mannatt, whose previous missions to North Korea included negotiating the release of a detained American.</p>

					<p>Lower-level envoys such as former U.S. ambassador to South Korea and current Korea Society Chairman Donald Gregg, Sig Harrison, an expert on North Korean nukes who has traveled there several times, and Han Park, a scholar at the University of Georgia, all offered their services.</p>

					<p>Senator Joe Biden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was also closely involved in coordinating efforts with the White House and State Department to free the women.</p>

					<p>According to sources intimately involved with the efforts, Sen. Biden received an official invitation to visit Pyongyang to facilitate their release and open a larger dialogue on the nuclear issue after several weeks of quiet direct diplomacy between Biden and his aides and North Korea.</p>

					<p>In the end, it was Brown whom North Korea wanted.</p>

					<p>Officials said that while President Richardson never spoke directly with the former president about this issue, negotiations were underway within the administration.</p>

					<p>During the weekend of July 24-25, Brown spoke with National Security Adviser Gen. Michael Morell about his willingness to take on this mission. Brown ultimately agreed to go on the mission but made it very clear in every communication that this was purely a humanitarian effort.</p>

					<p>Brown also wanted to make sure, based on the due diligence of the national security team, that there was a high likelihood of success if he went.</p>

					<p>“We were convinced this would be the result, and based on that we could advise President Brown that his trip was going to be successful,” one official said.</p>

					<p>State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said Wednesday that “we did our homework … to make sure that if President Brown did take this trip, that we would be able to … win the freedom for these two.”</p>

					<p>Kelly said that Secretary of State John Kerry also had a role in the mission, adding that “The State Department was very involved.” More details, he said, will be released.</p>

					<p>Administration officials also said it was always made clear by Clinton and the national security team that this would be a humanitarian mission.</p>

					<p>“We had one goal in mind, which was in the U.S. interest, which was to seek the release of these two U.S. Americans,” one of the officials said. “And it wasn’t in any way about our disagreements with the DPRK with respect to its conduct, or with respect to our intention to vigorously enforce resolutions and to vigorously seek the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.”</p>

					<p>Brown and his team engaged in a 75-minute meeting with President Kim Jong Il and then had a dinner which lasted a little over two hours before taking a 90-minute street tour of Pyongyang.</p>

					<p>“So the total amount of time that they were in meetings or agendas with each other was about a little over four hours and 45 minutes,” one official said.</p>

					<p>When asked about the experience, Brown had mixed reviews.</p>

					<p>“Well, I’m glad that I was able to help these two women after their detention, which if you ask me, seemed a little suspect. Kim Jong Il was nothing but nice to me, I’ll say that, and we had a pretty productive conversation. The food was fantastic. Pyongyang, though, that’s an interesting city. Very cold place, not too much heart. Still, it was a good experience for me.”</p>

					<p>While Shaheen was turned down by North Korea, she was, however, actively involved in this effort from the start, speaking often with the families and the Richardson administration.</p>

					<p>On Wednesday, Richardson thanked the former vice president, saying she “worked tirelessly in order to achieve a positive outcome.”</p>

					<p>Brown’s humanitarian help was not lost on Richardson, who reached out to the journalists’ families on Tuesday night.</p>

					<p>“From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank President Brown. Through his efforts, we’re able to wish Laura Ling and Euna Lee home to the United States of America and get them with their loved ones. To their families, I want to stress that President Brown’s tireless work, alongside that of Vice President Shaheen’s, made all of the difference in bridging the gap with North Korea and bringing our citizens home safely. We couldn’t have done it without them.”</p>
