			<br><p><b>Issues: </b>This is a heavily issue-based mod. There are five different issues in-game:</p>
			
			<br><p><b>Economics:</b> The U.S. is a <i>center-left</i> nation on econ, downright progressive in the Midwest. Notable red states that are economically left of center include Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, and West Virginia. Waving the flag of economic progressivism is often a winning move, especially if you have a suitable foil of a non-populist opponent. At the same time, some economic progressive policy (e.g. rail strike before Christmas) can result in negative economic effects that will hurt you. The Sun Belt states like Texas, GA, FL, and Arizona are center-right on economics.<br><br><i>Sample in-game scores (+1 is most leftist, -1 is the most conservative):</i><br> 0.6: Bernie '20. 0.45: Hawley/Vance. 0.25: U.S. political weighed mean. 0.2: Kamala '24. 0.1: Biden '20. -0.1: Trump/Vance. -0.7: Burgum/Rubio.</p>
			
			<br><p><b>Globalism:</b> This represents a mix of foreign policy, trade policy, general trust in the system, and association with the establishment; it's the primary variable that affects Trump-style realignments. While the U.S. as a whole is a bit more globalist than not, the crucial swing states - including Nevada, North Carolina, and especially the Midwest - are anti-globalist. However, the Sun Belt states of Arizona and Georgia are globalist; notable red states that are globalist include Florida, Texas, and Utah. Going globalist couples with a moderate economic strategy to try and win the Sun Belt - however, that will get you the real-world Democratic conundrum of winning the popular vote and flopping in the electoral college and Senate. Furthermore many anti-globalist options (e.g. caution on arming Ukraine, vetoing the NDAA) have popularity costs so you'll want to be judicial about them. Going anti-war is an anti-globalist option that will win over doves.<br><br><i>Sample in-game scores (+1 is most establishment, -1 is most anti-establishment):</i><br> 0.6: Rubio/Trump Jr. 0.4: Kamala or Biden. 0.1: U.S. political weighed mean. -0.2: Bernie '20. -0.5: Trump/Vance. -0.75: Ramaswamy/Lara Trump.</p>
			
			<br><p><b>Social issues:</b> The U.S. is <i>center-right</i> on social issues - the Midwest is fairly socially conservative, while the Sun Belt states of Georgia and Arizona are both socially liberal. The only red state left-of-center on social issues is Alaska. Running too far to the left on social issues will not only upset the general populace, but also unions and Latinos as well. However, running to the center on social issues will upset staffers and small-dollar donors - who are predominately weird globalist social-progressive coastal liberals (like yours truly) - represented by a global multiplier hit.<br><br><i> Sample in-game scores (+1 is most socially liberal, -1 is most socially conservative):</i><br> 0.4: Biden or Bernie. 0.3 - Kamala '24. -0.05: U.S. political weighed mean. -0.2: Burgum/Trump Jr. -0.3: Trump/Vance. -0.7: DeSantis/Rubio.</p>
			
			<br><p><b>Immigration:</b> The U.S. is <i>center-right</i> on immigration - the Midwest is fairly conservative, and the border states (TX/AZ/NM) are also considerably more right-wing on immigration than you'd expect from their general political leanings. No red states are left-of-center on immigration. Being too permissive on immigration will not only upset the general populace, but also make unions upset that you're depressing wages and Latinos upset that they're cutting the line. But harshness on immigration will also upset small-dollar donors and more liberal-leaning Latinos - especially those Spanish speakers who are first or second-generation - resulting in global multiplier and Latino approval hits. Immigration is also good for the economy.<br><br> Bernie himself was historically immigration-skeptical from a pro-union perspective (voting against comprehensive reform in 2007), but moved to the left over time, especially for the 2020 primary where he ran far to the left of most candidates (the game assumes that he moderated after winning the primary for the general election.) In 2025, he's critiqued Biden's policy as too permissive but has not made it clear what his current stance is other than "between Trump and Biden." <br><br><i>Sample in-game scores (+1 is most pro-immigration, -1 is most anti-immigration):</i><br>0.4: Biden or Bernie '20. 0.3 - Kamala '24. 0 - Bernie '07 and Burgum/Rubio. -0.1: U.S. political weighed mean. -0.75: Trump/Vance.</p>
			
			<br><p><b>Inflation:</b> This is a special issue, the only one that changes values. It starts at 1 (no inflation at all) nationwide, and every question, it moves based on the inflation rate, with the issue score itself reflecting the cumulative price increase since the start of your Presidency. Your opponents move with it - you do not, except by picking the right answers (e.g. advocating price controls, looking like you're doing things to worry about inflation) to help neutralize it. It's much more important in the coastal states than the heartland - the mod's theory of politics is that this issue score is the primary reason Ds slid hard in e.g. CA/NY/etc. in 2024.</p>
			
			<br><p>Other than inflation, no state issue scores will ever change in this game - but your opponent will have their own issue scores, and the relative importance of issue scores can and will change during the game. Due to limited attention spans, getting attention for one issue will suck attention away from others. If you raise the banner of economic progressivism and de-emphasize everything else, you can get historically working-class Democratic or swing states like Missouri, West Virginia, and Kentucky to consider you against the right opponent. Bernie's campaign questions have the dual purpose of increasing the importance of the issue you're attacking the opponent on, and moving the opponent on that issue. Bernie is much better at attacking opponents on economic policy than other subjects, but that may not always be the best subject for attack.</p>
			
			<br><p>Regarding <b>state multipliers:</b> This game tries to avoid most uses of state multipliers, going by issues instead. Your opponents are differentiated almost exclusively by issue scores (minus minor home state effects.) State multipliers are used for several purposes - primarily for demographic effects - E.g. making unions/Latinos happy/unhappy will result in nationwide movement expressed by state multipliers weighed to the percentage of the voter-eligible population that are union members/Latinos. Hitting Hawley for keeping Sweden and Finland from joining NATO will result in movement in states weighed by Swedish or Finnish American population (mostly just Minnesota, a few others too.) Hitting Vance for blaming Irish/Italian/German immigrants for bringing crime a century ago will result in movement in states weighed by those populations (largely the Midwest and Northeast.) <br><br>State multipliers also come into play when you specifically campaign in a state, or when you select a VP for home-state effects. Finally, the last question will result in movement in each state consisting of the difference between the real-world 2024 538 final forecast and the 2024 actual results to reflect the real-world polling miss (whichever state you campaign in last will have that drop reduced.) 
			
			</p>
			<br><p><b>Variable mechanics</b>
			
			<br><br><b>Fervor</b> (internally called authenticity) - This goes up when Bernie gives in-character answers and goes down when he gives out-of-character answers; it also naturally decays over time. It's mainly checked on Q30 - you want to keep it at 8+ for that question. You really don't want it -8 or lower for Q30. Having it low can also result in a bad debate later - too many compromises makes Bernie bern out.
			
			<br><br><b>Political capital</b> - Affects your deal-making capability. This is limited to what your opposing party is willing to bargain on - no amount of political capital will convince Manchinema to remove the filibuster, or Rs to support things like the PRO Act, immigration reform, or M4A. Its utility usually goes down significantly starting in 2023, because Republicans are less willing to bargain with you - unless you go the full bipartisan route.
			
			<br><br><b>Party unity</b> - Primarily affects downballot results - each point gives +/- 0.5% margin-wise for downballot elections in non-presidential years. In 2024, each point will translate into a +/- 0.25% multiplier for you at the start of the campaign, and a +/-0.25% downballot effect at election. Party unity also affects how much support gets leeched from you to a strong Green Party or any third-party centrists, as well as the willingness of the party to support you if you try to get a Republican speaker.
			
			<br><br><b>Base support</b> - Doves, workers (really <i>union</i> workers), and Latinos (really Latino <i>citizens</i>) are separately tracked. Your answer in Q1 determines how high their expectations are - the default is +3 happy/-3 unhappy thresholds. If you promised big and raised expectations, it's +5/-1 for workers and Latinos and +4/-2 for doves. If you lowered expectations, it's +1/-5 for workers and Latinos and +2/-4 for doves. Approvals are not only affected by your actions as President and on the campaign trail, but also by who your opponent is. Peace activists will be much more willing to support you against Rubio, while Latinos will be much more likely to defect to him for instance. The relationship between the approvals (which is highest or lowest) determine who your opponent is. Overall, happy groups result in a roughly 2.5% national boost each; unhappy groups result in a roughly -2.5% national boost each.<br><br>
			Both Latinos and Workers are affected by price increases - every 1% of cumulative inflation sends their approvals down 0.1. ("I know Bernie fought for comprehensive immigration reform... but the price of eggs.") Doves do not care about inflation - they care solely about staying out of war (or appearing to seek peace when you get involved), as well as things like not banning TikTok. In addition to policy, interest group opinions are affected by what happens during your re-election campaign: Workers like it when you call out your opponent as a corporate shill, and dislike it when you call out your opponent for wanting tariffs. Doves like it when you attack someone for being pro-war, and dislike it when you attack someone for being too anti-war. Latinos like it when you call out people successfully on immigration. You also can have the opportunity to affect their opinion via VP selections (if you're playing as Kamala), campaign locations (as Bernie), or generally by pandering to them when a different group's opinion is being checked (e.g. "The peace movement is important, but your focus has to shift to Latinos now.") 
			
			<br><br><b>The economy</b> - the nation goes into recession when this is negative. Brief small recessions are very survivable, the country going into a new Great Recession is not. Having a recession followed by strong economic recovery is not too bad - the penalty will rapidly fade as the economy improves (the "Morning in America" effect.) Additionally, there is essentially a floor to how much you can lose here - no matter how awful the economy gets and stays, it won't take away more than around 20% of your initial support. Thanks to the Phillips curve, recessions will tend to lower inflation; an overheated economy (>10, or especially >12) will tend to raise inflation. Rare deflation will meanwhile hurt the economy (Japan-ification.) Beyond legislation and not screwing up, this is heavily determined by the actions of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, who a President gets to appoint and has no oversight over (unless you're willing to challenge the law, as Trump keeps hinting at in our world.)
			
			<br><br><b>Inflation</b> - The rate is how much prices are going up annualized; the cumulative inflation is how much prices have gone up since you were inaugurated, and is what sucks away much of your support. The real-world value is prices up ~19% over 2021-2024; in-game, a range of 13-41% is possible. You can aggressively fight inflation, or you can just wait for the supply chains to get sorted out and the Fed to act. Overall, good politics is different from good policy, and the compromises needed to keep inflation in check and improve the economy are sometimes not worth it. 
			<br><br>To deal with inflation, options include spending less, raising taxes or cutting spending (austerity), getting others to spend less (e.g. More Medicare for Some), appointing an aggressive Fed chair (Kashkari goes from very dovish to very hawkish at the start of 2022, both in-game and in the real-world), avoiding things that will blow up the supply chain more (e.g. rail strike, letting shipping lanes get subjected to war, losing Taiwan's microchip factories), and doing things that will help sort out the supply chain faster (e.g. removing fossil fuel moratoriums, getting America working again faster by reopening schools early, not-IRA, etc.) The real-world estimate by the SF Federal Reserve is that Biden's stimulus contributed roughly 3 percentage points of the ~10% inflation rate; this mod uses that value (other stimuluses are similarly calibrated to it), and attributes the remainder to transient inflation.
			
			<br><br><b>Party Ideology</b> - This mainly affects the endings. Namely, if you get re-elected with a friendly House and Senate, are Ds willing to go for Medicare for All? The criteria is having a trifecta and "Senate seats + econ progressiveness + political capital/2 >=60". Social progressivism is largely cosmetic (if you go too conservative, the party won't be willing to codify Roe or get comprehensive immigration reform though.) If you exactly copy the real-world, this moves the party a lot more to the right than the real world - my excuse is that *Bernie* going full establishment would be much more dramatic party-wise than Biden doing so.</p>
			
			<br><p><b>Other mechanics</b>
			
			<br><br><b>The assassination</b> is conducted by Thomas Matthew Crooks, who shoots you as long as you show up in the greater Pittsburgh area for him to target (by campaigning in West Mifflin, PA.) Otherwise he shoots your opponent. From what we know of him - looking up public appearances of many prominent figures including both Biden and Trump - it seems clear that he was an equal-opportunity assassin who'd have targeted the first major-party candidate to show up near him. Being the assassination target will create a small backlash in favor of the victim, but this is intentionally small on both sides (up to a 2.5% margin swing) - partly because Trump's real-world one was small and partly because I did not want to incentivize the player to get Bernie killed.
			<br><br>Surviving an assassination will help you recover from staying in after a bad debate (rally-to-the-flag effect); if you are the target of an assassination and replaced by Kamala, Kamala will get more political benefit from options that double down on supporting Bernie and it will cost her more to throw Bernie under the bus. Dying to an assassination after a bad debate, meanwhile, will fuel conspiracy theories that Kamala or the establishment was behind it, hurting the ticket.
			
			<br><br>The overall <b>2021 and 2022 election results</b> are determined by the national popular vote margin and party unity. Important state positions (both crucial governorship positions in 2022, state legislatures in 2022/2023, or each of the Senate races in 2024) are tracked behind the scenes and determined by local margins and party unity. They aren't publicly displayed because I realize that 99% of players do not care about who won the Virginia state legislature in 2023. It is impossible to do better than red ripple in the 2022 midterms - the Doylist explanation is that I did not want to write additional branching. The Watsonian explanation is that Bernie's voter base is akin to Obama's - intermittent and less willing to turn out in midterms.
			
			<br><br><b>Third party candidates</b> will see RFK Jr. disproportionately take votes from Republicans (however he will drop out and endorse any MAGA Republican), while centrists and Green Party candidates will predominately take votes from you. A viability mechanic means that third party candidates tend to fade over time (generally, 50% by the time of the election) so long as they are not serious candidates. However, if you do worse than a 3rd-party candidate in one state, they may start taking more votes instead - imagine that local figures see them as viable and begin endorsing them over time. Third-party votes do translate down into downballot votes too. 
			
			<br><br><b>Foreign interference</b> always occurs on Q40. The opinion of Russia+China towards the player are tracked over time, and depending on how strongly they feel, they may engage in anything from deepfakes to hacking (a la 2016) to social media interference from most to least impactful. Notably, banning Tiktok by the time foreign interference has happened (either getting it automatically banned via sanctions or war with the PRC, or getting it banned by Labor Day on the TikTok question) will roughly halve the impact of foreign interference. (I don't have any special knowledge about TikTok, but it's very clear that this is something that multiple world governments are very concerned about.)
			
			<br><br><b>The Federal Reserve</b> will act starting on Q16 to hike rates to hurt the economy and reduce inflation when inflation is high and lower rates to help the economy and increase inflation when inflation is low and the economy needs help. Their strategy varies by Fed chair. <br><b>Kashkari</b> appears dovish to Bernie at the start, but does a 180 shortly after to push aggressively for rate hikes against inflation. His behavior pattern in-game is "responds aggressively to all crises - recession and inflation - prioritizing the latter. Acts as a mega-dove to improve the economy when inflation is low and there's no recession." Because of his tendency to aggressively respond, he can easily overreact to small changes. <br><b>Powell</b> is hawkish, prioritizing inflation over the economy.<br> <b>Clarida</b> is dovish - he will still prioritize inflation, but he will be more cautious about raising rates in order to try and minimize economic damage. <br><b>Brainard</b> is dovish by default, but also the only person who listens to what you say though she won't do anything do acknowledge that - this is a giant stretch, but I did want to give the player more agency here. If you tell her to raise rates, she acts the same as Powell. If you tell her to keep rates low, she goes mega-dove, being cautious about hiking rates to avoid recession and aggressively acting against all recessions unless inflation is 10+%.
			
			<br><br> <b>Speaker Upton</b> is achieved by getting a red ripple in 2022, and going for the option while you have party unity 4+, political capital 3+, and a secret variable bipartisanship 4+. Bipartisanship is increased by going establishment, being solicitous to Rs (whether or not it succeeds), not attacking Rs, and not doing things like abandoning Israel/Ukraine that both parties really hate. The variable also becomes useful for working with a Republican Congress in 2023-2024, though it's intentionally hard to do so. If you keep Congress happy, you can get up to two Grand Bargains with Speaker Upton - getting an achievement. (If you fail, you get a question notifying you that Speaker Upton is in trouble in lieu of the second legislation opportunity.) 
			<br><br>The other Speakers are largely cosmetic, but they are differentiated by a cooperativeness variable - Upton is +10, Tom Emmer is +2, Mike Johnson is +1, Kevin McCarthy is 0, Austin Scott is -1. This is checked when you push for legislation (i.e. stimulus in a bad economy or changes to a CHIPS bill.)
			
			<br><br><b>The prosecution of Trump</b> succeeds only if you push for it and have appointed a domestic progressive cabinet - Vanita Gupta expedites it, Merrick Garland is unwilling to rush things too much.
			
			<br><br><b>Your initial cabinet</b> determines a lot of policy at the start of your term. A domestic progressive cabinet can arrest Trump, will aggressively cancel fossil fuel leases on federal lands, will favor unions at the Department of Labor and will have a permissive immigration policy. A progressive foreign policy cabinet will withhold arms from Ukraine until they fully implement Minsk II, from Israel until they stop expanding settlements, from Taiwan until they fully disavow independence rhetoric that provokes China, and from UAE and the Saudis for their brutal war in Yemen and murdering Khashoggi. Establishment versions of both are basically real-world Biden.
			
			<br><br><b>Your initial opponents</b> are deterministic. If you did not jail Trump, then Trump is always the nominee with running mates JD Vance (if the constituency with the highest approval still is not happy), Doug Burgum (if workers are happy and the highest approval), Marco Rubio (if doves are happy and the highest approval), or Tim Scott (if Latinos are happy and the highest approval.) Those four were reportedly his VP finalists in real life. If Trump was jailed, the opposing tickets are DeSantis/Burgum (if Latinos have the lowest approval of all three), Hawley/Vance (if workers have the lowest approval), or Trump Jr./Ramaswamy (if doves have the lowest approval.)
			<br><br> If something happens to your opponent, his VP will lead the ticket. If the opponent was Trump, the new VP candidate will always be Trump Jr. Otherwise the possible replacement tickets are Burgum/Rubio, Vance/Cotton, or Ramaswamy/Lara Trump.
			
			<br><br><b>True randomness</b> exists in this mod when you are intentionally gambling with disaster - namely, playing hardball on the debt ceiling (trying to invoke the 14th Amendment), or tickling the dragon's tail by pushing Russia/China to the breaking point. Variable-modified randomness also exists - e.g. the bad debate is guaranteed with fervor -10 or below and guaranteed not to happen if fervor is not negative, but in between it's random with (-fervor*10)% chance. The chance of whistleblower when sitting on serious foreign interference is also randomnized but modified via how much the national security establishment likes/dislikes you. </p>
			
			<br><p><b>Ending aspects</b>
			
			<br><br><b>Stop the Steal</b> is entirely deterministic. The hidden variable Republican radicalism is tracked throughout the game - doing the logical things like prosecuting Trump or de facto open borders increase it. Winning the election on election night while losing the popular vote by a lot also increases it. How willing Rs are to go for it depends heavily on their ticket (full MAGA tickets like Trump/Vance are the most willing to go for it; full non-MAGA tickets like DeSantis/Burgum are the least willing), which can dramatically reduce the variable. Behind the scenes, key downballot results like control of governorships, state legislatures, and SoS races is tracked in the 2021, 2022, and 2023 elections. Virginia, for instance, will only be vulnerable to Stop the Steal if you've slid enough in Virginia in 2023 for Republicans to take control of the legislature behind the scenes. <br><br>Overall, states are vulnerable to Stop the Steal if your popular vote margin of victory is smaller than 0.5%* Republican Radicalism (where Rs have a trifecta), or 0.2%* Republican Radicalism (if they only have the legislature.) If the collective states that are vulnerable is enough to flip the election or throw it to the House, they go for it. Mechanically, in states where they have full control, you're unable to dispute it and the electors there are awarded to Republicans in the state details (regardless of what it's colored on the map.) In states where they have partial control, both your electors and R electors will be sent, resulting in the electors for that state being zeroed out to reflect the deadlock. <br><br> Afterwards, the military can weigh in on the next slide - it does so if a hidden variable "blob_approval" (only used here and one other place) is at least 5. You increase this variable by doing things that agree with what the foreign policy establishment want (e.g. arming Ukraine and Israel, banning TikTok) and having an opponent repugnant to them (e.g. Vivek Ramaswamy.) 
			
			<br><br><b>Faithless electors</b> only affect Kamala, when she's done something to strongly annoy progressives (e.g. throwing Bernie under the bus.) This is a random effect dependent on Left Anger (internally progressive_anger) - the value is reduced by 2 and then halved if you officially won (victory makes up for a lot of sins and they're reluctant to throw the election), and then halved if Bernie is alive (he tries to talk them out of it.) Afterwords, every single elector has a Left Anger% chance of going faithless. This can potentially see the election thrown to a contingent election.
			
			<br><br><b>Contingent elections</b> occur when the election is deadlocked (usually because it's a 269-269 tie or Kamala's electors went faithless.) This will inevitably result in a Republican president via the House, which votes en bloc - every state collectively has a vote so California's 52 Representatives get the same number of votes as Wyoming's 1 representative. The Vice Presidency depends on a Senate vote; this can result in unusual VP scenarios - e.g. Trump with AOC as VP if you picked her as running mate and have the Senate (such a split White House with President Trump gives a unique ending slide.)<br><br> Furthermore, a very edge-case scenario is written into the game in which, if the Vice Presidency is empty on Election Night (from Bernie getting assassinated, Rs controlling the Senate, and Mitch McConnell being Mitch McConnell), if the election goes to a contingent vote, and if the 2024 Senate election results give a 50-50 tie, <i>there is no Vice President to break the tie</i> meaning that the tie will continue indefinitely until someone dies, someone crosses party lines, or a new Senate is elected in 2026. I am not certain this is actually possible in-game - I'd guess it isn't due to the sheer impossibility of getting a red wave in 2022, and gaining 2 Senate seats in 2024 while deadlocking the electoral college - but there is a very well-deserved achievement on CTS if you somehow manage it.
			
			<br><br>To get a <b>Gaza ceasefire in 2024</b>, you need to never arm Israel and get re-elected. Namely, in 2021 you need to either appoint a foreign policy cabinet, or annoy Sinema enough for her to switch parties and then get a second chance to disarm Israel. Then, refuse to arm them after October 7. If you get re-elected, Netanyahu - who was running short of artillery shells and manpower and desperately hoping you'd lose - caves shortly after the election, giving you a special ending slide and a CTS achievement.
			
			<br><br><b>The endings were written</b> by the end of May 2025, and were completed before most of them (excepting MAGA tariffs) reflected real-world events. In the time since, as of late June 2025, two endings (Slide 19 - loss to Hawley resulting in CA National Guard being federalized to crush protesters, and Slide - 22 loss to Rubio resulting in him bombing Iran) have been overtaken by real-world events.

It is not the best electoral result you can get, but it will likely get you Medicare for All, and is an example in case it helps. Visit Missouri every time.
			<li>1. People fought tooth and nail to elect you - some of them <i>died</i> for you. That sacrifice will not, <i>must not</i> be in vain. </li>

			<p><b>If you want to do better than the above</b> and achieve the True Ending - passing Medicare for All on hard difficulty - here is a set of answer IDs that will usually get you that. It requires much more compromises than on normal due to the higher difficulty. Visit Missouri every time, and either turn off randomness or restart if Sinema changes parties or the Supreme Court rules against you on the debt ceiling (both of those are unlikely): 1001, 2002, 3002, 4004, 5002, 6003, 7001, 8004, 9001, 10103, 11003, 12003, 13002, 14002, 15101, 16001, 17002, 18002, 19001, 20001, 21001, 22101, 23002, 24101, 25102, 26001, 27201, 28001, 29301, 30001, 31101, 32001, 33002, 34502, 35301, 36004, 37003, 38401, 39102, 40202, 41002, 42501, 43201, 44003</p>
			<br><p><b>Author commentary</b>
			
			<br><br>Rationale for certain design decisions: 
			<li>The reason Bernie is able to do very un-Bernie things in this mod is that I assumed that people would want to do things that Bernie was vehemently opposed to IRL like "fill Ukraine with weapons prior to the invasion" or "refuse to arm Israel against Gaza right after October 7"; that implied hence a greater ability for Bernie to do things in-game that he's strongly opposed to in real life (as long as there is some realistic justification that doing so is compatible with his realistic goals and ideals - I let him bend much more on immigration than any other issue due to his historical flexibility there.) This caused the creation of the Fervor mechanic to incentivize the player to actually chose in-character options.</li>
			<li>With regards to the use of true randomness, my intent as a designer was to <i>make a simulator that puts the player in the shoes of the Presidency</i> over <i>make a game that people have fun playing.</i> In game, there are a number of options which are "ideal" as long as you can control randomness - namely, getting the Supreme Court to support you on the debt ceiling, or filling Ukraine with weapons. However, real-world Presidents were very concerned about doing so due to the catastrophic risk of potential failure - a risk they struggled to estimate and had no control over. Unlike players, a real-world President cannot look up which answer results in their desired result - my intent was to force the same conundrum on the player in the base settings (upon which, if they wished, they could simply turn off all randomness.)</li>
			<li>With regards to nuclear war in-game: Realistically, almost all nuclear wars would almost certainly be much less abrupt than it currently comes off as in-game. It would generally involve a myriad of pathways - most commonly involving the use of single nuclear weapons (perhaps a tactical nuke) for intimidation, followed by a player escalation, followed by further escalation or so on. Fundamentally however, I wanted to avoid turning the game into Nuclear Response Simulator. Once a tactical nuke has been used, the game would be effectively over anyways.</li>
			<li>With regards to Manchin and Sinema's presence in the mod. They are actually much more accommodating to the player in-game than they were in reality. For instance, it's quite likely that both would have vehemently opposed a stimulus much larger than IRL or a number of Cabinet choices (incl. SoS Barrbara Lee.) Manchin would almost certainly have also opposed attempts by Bernie to appoint a Fed chair dovish on inflation - he was very vocal on having the Fed focus on controlling inflation - which would likely have caused him to reject everyone but Powell. Furthermore, I allow the player to pass a Medicare expansion 2021 which both Sinema and Manchin were vehemently opposed to IRL despite Biden's best attempts. The Doylist reason for treating them this way is to try and give the player more agency and not leave them feeling completely hopeless; the Watsonian reason is that they're much more worried about what Bernie can do via executive action and are hence more willing to try and keep him working with them and reward him for compromising. </li>
			<li>Regarding Israel's behavior in the mod: Hamas began planning Al-Aqsa Flood circa 2014 and decided to implement it following the 2021 clashes. It's unlikely that any U.S. decision could have averted it - in fact, U.S. withholding of arms would likely have encouraged an attack (akin to Hamas considering Israeli opposition protests to constitute an opportune time for their own attack.) While it is possible the date of the attack could have changed (e.g. if Iran and Hezbollah were willing in 2022 to join in), I avoided that possibility for simplicity. There are two possible pathways by which Bibi could be pressured to stop the war - namely, direct quid-pro-quo (i.e. you do XYZ - e.g. send arms, and Israel does ABC - e.g. stop attacking Gaza), or the pathway of Israeli munitions shortages leading to greater casualties, leading to political pressure, which eventually forces an end to the war (the Vietnam/Afghanistan pathway.) I concluded that the first was unlikely for the purpose of the mod though others could easily come to different interpretations. The shipments the U.S. sends Israel consists largely of things falling in the category of "nice to have" (e.g. additional munitions, aircraft parts, etc.) rather than "existentially necessary"; Netanyahu has refused pressure from the U.S. in the past (e.g. by the Obama administration over settlement policy), appears to be ideologically convinced that the continuation of Israeli settlement policy is necessary, and appears to strongly dislike the appearance of giving in to external pressure (incl. from the U.S.) for apparent fear of encouraging more in the future. Furthermore, the continuation of the Gaza war is necessary for his political survival and his governing coalition's existence (via Ben-Gvir until Gideon Sa'ar rejoined Likud), which is existentially necessary for him to put off the state inquiry into his own culpability in the attacks and sabotage the prosecution of him for corruption - either of which could result in catastrophic consequences for him. Netanyahu would also have the additional incentive that if Bernie loses re-election, he will almost certainly receive arms from whoever the new President is (and he would likely despise Bernie personally.) For this reason, I concluded that Netanyahu would likely try to continue the war as long as possible - in theory, he could potentially be persuaded at most to accept temporary humanitarian pauses to receive arms, but I did not think that would be a satisfying outcome for the average player and so it is not directly touched upon in-story. As a result, the main pressure point for Bibi to seek peace in-game is via increased casualties causing the war to become politically expensive, which is naturally a slow pathway.</li>
			
			<br><br>In so much as this mod has a <b>general message about American political systems</b> as a whole, it's to try and illustrate and explain the structures and incentives at play to explain why American politics is broken in the eyes of the majority. The system is set up to place all the visual responsibility in the person of the President, who has no actual ability to make legislation. Getting legislation requires Congress which they do not necessarily control. The House can be very difficult to win due to gerrymandering (though not in the present political paradigm); the Senate is often very skewed against one party or another in terms of the national margin needed to win it (especially true in the present political paradigm), and the filibuster adds only even greater barriers to achieving legislative change. This is a system that feels like it is meant to make legislative change extremely difficult while blaming everything on the person of the President - who has little power to actually do things - when it fails to happen.<br><br>Any would-be president must run on a legislative agenda, promising to e.g. accomplish Medicare for All (not just "Medicare for All if I get Congress sufficiently" - that's uninspiring.) But they don't actually have any power to do those things themselves - only yell at other people to do them, and stop those other people from doing things the President dislikes. The inevitable result is that they run for office making promises that they do not know if they can fulfill or not, and may of them end up inevitably not being fulfilled - not because they specifically failed as a person but because the system failed to allow them to do it. The increase in political polarization, expectations falling out of pace with what's likely achievable, etc. only further increases this problem. And even though the U.S. hates the existing system, they hate radical change - such as changing the existing system to make change easier - even more. And those activists strongly motivated by passing legislation (e.g. "Medicare for All") are not strongly motivated by the often-complicated pathway (e.g. "we need to moderate on social issues to be able to win Senate seats in socially conservative states to elect enough Senators willing to remove the filibuster and pass Medicare for All") to get said legislation.
			
			<br><br>In-so-much as this mod has a <b>commentary on the Biden administration's mistakes</b>, the specific thesis is <i>the Biden administration chose many options that were each individually reasonable in the short term that boiled down to not dramatically changing things or rocking the boat, but failed to fall into a coherent long-term strategy.</i> Part of this, of course, was that the Biden administration did not know what came next (as the player does), but also that the Biden administration made incorrect calculations that - e.g. not disarming Israel, as was in accord with general public opinion, was also the best choice for a Democratic candidate and that war opponents would essentially get over it. The intent of the Biden options available in the mod is that each of them is individually reasonable and defensible but will result in the real-world loss eventually. 
			
			<br><br>In-so-much as the mod has a <b>commentary on the office of the Presidency</b> and being an incumbent President, it is that being the President is exhausting, hard, infuriating, tiring, and complicated. This is especially true for anyone President in the age of 2021-2024, in which it seems like most nations have faced a significant anti-incumbent backlash. Frankly, I think Bernie would have done better in-office in 2016 (if he was able to win by enough to take the House and a significant Senate majority via coattails, as appeared possible from polling at the time) than 2020. His policy instincts (larger stimuluses and anti-interventionism) would have been especially suited for the Obama era, if only there existed any chance of him actually being elected President in 2008.</p>`,

Kamala fit the bill on all three.<br><br>Kamala knew how to play the game in ways that sometimes made you shake your head. But she also gets the need for change in her own way - she backed Medicare for All in the primaries and ran as a progressive, though you wonder how much of that is expediency. Millions are counting on you to end endless wars, tackle climate change, and pass Medicare for All. But you won't achieve any of it without a united party - and that means doing what Trump did and taking it over from the inside. Winning over the base. Winning over people like Kamala.</div>",
