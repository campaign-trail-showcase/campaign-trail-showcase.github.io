After a bitter primary battle, Johnson now leads the GOP into one of the most consequential elections of the 1920s—but his victory has divided the party and reshaped the political landscape. \n<p>\nAmerica in 1928 is a nation of contrasts. The economic boom of the Roaring Twenties masks growing inequality, Prohibition fuels crime and corruption, and Wall Street’s excesses go unchecked. \n\nThis election is predicted to be unique and extremely close, between a Progressive Republican and a Conservative Democrat. Both of them were previously failed candidates with little to no hope of even getting a glimpse of presidency. However, a miracle has happened for both of them is this race. Both candidates will have to emphasize on their strong experience, credentials and convince the voters to win the presidency.",

As governor of California (1911–1917), he has a long record of experience, and pioneered progressive reforms like women’s suffrage, workers’ compensation, and direct democracy tools like the referendum. <p>\n\n\n\nElected to the Senate in 1917, Johnson became the lonely voice of Midwestern/Western populism in a party increasingly dominated by Conservative Business Financiers, railing against Imperialism, the League of Nations, and Prohibition.\n\nBy 1928, Johnson is done playing nice. The years of Conservative governance and dominance has angered him. \n<p>\nHoover enters the convention as the presumed nominee—but Frank Lowden got a \"write-in\" by party conservatives, leading to a deadlocked convention. Johnson’s allies, led by  George Norris, Charles McNary, William Borah and Fiorello La Guardia, seizes this chance, and rallies the party’s Progressive faction.\nWestern Progressive delegates flocked to Johnson, but Hoover and Lowden remains the leading candidates. \n<p>\nHowever, after five ballots, Dawes, Curtis and Smoot makes a sudden endorsement of Johnson, abruptly stopping Hoover's momentum, while Lowden's machine cracks. Before Hoover and Lowden's delegates can regain control, Johnson had been nominated, on the 10th Ballot.<h4>\n",
