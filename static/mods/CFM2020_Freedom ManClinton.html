It was an election for the ages, no matter how it went. Regardless of me losing or winning, they&rsquo;ll be talking about it for years. The great battle between Cheeseburger Freedom Man and Salad Dictatorship Woman.<br /><br />Huh. Saying that name outloud is weird. Saying anything is weird. I can feel so many memories, but it&rsquo;s like I can&rsquo;t truly grasp them. They exist at the outer edges of my consciousness. I reach out to try and hold them, only for them to be swatted away by an unknown otherworldly force: a force that exists within my own mind.<br /><br />And it&rsquo;s not even really my own mind. It&rsquo;s the mind of a dead man. He had his time, but I&rsquo;ve convinced the world that it didn&rsquo;t truly end. &ldquo;Cheeseburger Freedom Man still has some fight in him&rdquo; is what they&rsquo;ll all say. They&rsquo;ll praise my &lsquo;bravery&rsquo;, &lsquo;strength&rsquo;, and &lsquo;resilience&rsquo;, but it&rsquo;s not me. Not really. Deep down, I know I&rsquo;ll never be him, no matter how hard I try.<br /><br />They told me I would be the perfect President. Time to test that theory out.<br /><br />The day finally came where the two of us would meet in-person. Cloneburger Freedom Man and Salad Dictatorship, two titans of American politics in the same room. Everyone had bought the switch until her. She saw who I was deep down, and she could detect the treachery.<br /><br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not really him,&rdquo; she said, putting a finger up at my lips to prevent me from protesting, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t lie to me. I can tell. I knew you&hellip; Well, him, enough. It&rsquo;s just not the same.&rdquo;<br /><br />I can hear my men storming through the rest of the White House, about to break down the door of the Oval Office and take this whole charade down once and for all. It&rsquo;s time. It&rsquo;s happening again. All. Over. Again.<br /><br />A pained smile appears on her face. &ldquo;I really did love him,&rdquo; she said, pointing to her heart,&rdquo; deep down.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;He had a warmth that he didn&rsquo;t show to many others. He cared about things like saving the bees and legalizing marijuana, but that wasn&rsquo;t what he loved. What he loved was me, and I loved him.&rdquo; She frowned. &ldquo;It was so&hellip; perfect. Until it wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;<br /><br />She stood up and walked over to the various paintings in the room. Her gaze shifted between each as she moved. &ldquo;I ran for the Presidency because I wanted to&hellip;&rdquo; Her lips flickered between kindness and anger. &ldquo;I wanted to try to make him understand the errors of his ways. Honest.&rdquo;<br /><br />She turned around to look at me, it was as if she was looking at a ghost. &ldquo;But it didn&rsquo;t work. I got corrupted just like him. We got angry, tried to focus on tearing down each other, and the nation with it, instead of what&rsquo;s best for everyone. It got so damn complicated in the end.&rdquo;<br /><br />The men are closer now, we&rsquo;re only a mere 30 seconds away from them coming in.<br /><br />&ldquo;Too bad!&rdquo; I replied, a cocky grin on my stolen face as I whipped out a gun at her, aiming it at her lower torso.<br /><br />She scoffed. &ldquo;This is what it all came down to? Really?&rdquo;<br /><br />The men bust down the doors, screaming at the top of their lungs at each. Everyone has a gun drawn on each other. It&rsquo;s a total clusterfuck.<br /><br />I find myself having a momentary change of heart. &ldquo;Men, leave the room and wait outside. I'll handle this myself.&rdquo;<br /><br />One of them tried to grab my arm. &ldquo;I said &lsquo;get out&rsquo;, or are you too deaf to understand that?&rdquo;<br /><br />He shook his head and motioned for the others to follow him out. And so, it came down to this, the final two candidates, facing off each other in a duel.<br /><br />&ldquo;Only one of us can live, you know?&rdquo; Salad Dictatorship Woman said as she dusted off her red pistol.<br /><br />I only nodded my head back. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll finish this in three&hellip; two&hellip; one&hellip; GO!&rdquo;<br /><br />Two shots were fired, and one person slumped to the ground dead. They still never learned who shot first to this day.</p>"

Everyone could see they were bullshit. And whilst the general population began rallying for a recount, their guy sat in his cottage in Idaho.<br /><br />Timothy didn't quite know what to make of the events unfolding around him. He'd spent the past few weeks getting paraded around, treated like a deity amongst men, hailed as the deliverer of reform and the liberator from an oppressive two party system. Better men than him had, throughout history, succumbed to less adulation, and it was clear that the humble Timothy had begun creating quite the ego for himself.<br /><br />That worship, however, left as quickly as it arrived.<br /><br />Peeking through his curtains, Timothy looked at the empty lawn which surrounded his home. Where not so long ago there had been a flock of reporters, there was now a barren field, littered with pieces of wrappers, plastic, and various types of uranium scattered about. He could never quite get a read for the Belarusian reporter.<br /><br />As he looked, he felt his wife&rsquo;s presence behind him, which prompted a swift turn-around.<br /><br />&ldquo;Abigail, I-&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I know, the election results are a bust.&rdquo; - she looked up at him - &ldquo;but you've gotta admit, we came pretty close, didn't we?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It's not about that!&rdquo; - Timothy protested - &ldquo;I mean, yeah, it's a little bit about that, but&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />He turned his gaze away from her.<br /><br />&ldquo;I&hellip; I&rsquo;ve been a bit of a jerk these past few weeks, haven't I?&rdquo;<br /><br />Silence filled the room.<br /><br />&ldquo;I suppose I&hellip; I should probably apologize for it, rig-?&rdquo;<br /><br />His words were interrupted by a hug.<br /><br />&ldquo;Aw, you do care! I&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />She took a few seconds to find the right words.<br /><br />&ldquo;I feared that, had you won, you would have lost interest in me&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />Whilst he couldn't outright say it, Timothy shared that exact same fear. He pulled her closer, sharing an embrace which seemed to last an eternity.<br /><br />Finally, Timothy spoke up.<br /><br />&ldquo;You know, I heard they've opened a new ice cream parlor over in Washington. You wanna go check it out?&rdquo;<br /><br />A giggle broke out from Abigail&rsquo;s mouth.<br /><br />&ldquo;Washington? That's so far away!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You've got a point there&hellip; so it's best if we got going.&rdquo;<br /><br />It was a beautiful day outside. His wife right behind, Timothy opened the front door, causing the entire living room to get bathed in bright sunlight.<br /><br />&ldquo;After you, madam&rdquo; - he said, in an exaggerated Cockney accent.<br /><br />With this, they stepped outside to venture together, once more.</p>"

Everyone could see they were bullshit. And whilst the general population began rallying for a recount, their guy sat in his cottage in Idaho.<br /><br />Timothy didn't quite know what to make of the events unfolding around him. He'd spent the past few weeks getting paraded around, treated like a deity amongst men, hailed as the deliverer of reform and the liberator from an oppressive two party system. Better men than him had, throughout history, succumbed to less adulation, and it was clear that the humble Timothy had begun creating quite the ego for himself.<br /><br />That worship, however, left as quickly as it arrived.<br /><br />Peeking through his curtains, Timothy looked at the empty lawn which surrounded his home. Where not so long ago there had been a flock of reporters, there was now a barren field, littered with pieces of wrappers, plastic, and various types of uranium scattered about. He could never quite get a read for the Belarusian reporter.<br /><br />As he looked, he felt his wife&rsquo;s presence behind him, which prompted a swift turn-around.<br /><br />&ldquo;Abigail, I-&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I know, the election results are a bust.&rdquo; - she looked up at him - &ldquo;but you've gotta admit, we came pretty close, didn't we?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It's not about that!&rdquo; - Timothy protested - &ldquo;I mean, yeah, it's a little bit about that, but&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />He turned his gaze away from her.<br /><br />&ldquo;I&hellip; I&rsquo;ve been a bit of a jerk these past few weeks, haven't I?&rdquo;<br /><br />Silence filled the room.<br /><br />&ldquo;I suppose I&hellip; I should probably apologize for it, rig-?&rdquo;<br /><br />His words were interrupted by a hug.<br /><br />&ldquo;Aw, you do care! I&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />She took a few seconds to find the right words.<br /><br />&ldquo;I feared that, had you won, you would have lost interest in me&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />Whilst he couldn't outright say it, Timothy shared that exact same fear. He pulled her closer, sharing an embrace which seemed to last an eternity.<br /><br />Finally, Timothy spoke up.<br /><br />&ldquo;You know, I heard they've opened a new ice cream parlor over in Washington. You wanna go check it out?&rdquo;<br /><br />A giggle broke out from Abigail&rsquo;s mouth.<br /><br />&ldquo;Washington? That's so far away!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You've got a point there&hellip; so it's best if we got going.&rdquo;<br /><br />It was a beautiful day outside. His wife right behind, Timothy opened the front door, causing the entire living room to get bathed in bright sunlight.<br /><br />&ldquo;After you, madam&rdquo; - he said, in an exaggerated Cockney accent.<br /><br />With this, they stepped outside to venture together, once more.</p>"

The country was still reeling from the Nuclear Blizzard that wiped away all life everywhere except the USA and a few select parts of Canada: some experts we interviewed claimed this decision to be &ldquo;premature&rdquo; and, when we lied to them saying we wouldn't report this part of the interview, they also added that it was &ldquo;downright stupid&rdquo;.<br /><br />Regardless of criticism, the election went through regardless. And now that the votes are &gt;99% counted, calling the results &ldquo;shocking&rdquo; would be an immense understatement.<br /><br />To start off with, both major party leaders lost their respective seats, Papineau and Durham.&nbsp;<br /><br />Back in August, fiery outsider Poutine Canada Man would make a shock entry in the race, capturing an energy that reminded most of Ross Perot&rsquo;s successful bid in the 1996 American election. Things took a turn for the worst however, when a week before the election, files proving a link between Canada Man and Jeffrey Epstein were leaked to the press by an anonymous source. Shortly after, Canada Man would end his own life by throwing himself down a flight of stairs, breaking his legs, and stabbing himself 10 times in the back. After an intense examination, it was decided that he couldn't possibly govern the country in such a state, and he was withdrawn from the race.<br /><br />Despite this, a major upset happened nonetheless: former American President Cheeseburger Freedom Man, who lost reelection to his wife back in November of last year, had an unprecedented polling surge throughout all of Canada, shocking everyone including himself.<br /><br />Speaking at 24 Sussex Drive, a Freedom Man dressed in trousers and a Sonic t-shirt from Hot Topic would awkwardly stumble through his victory speech, before announcing an immediate invasion of the United States of America.<br /><br />The Dictatorship Woman administration has so far not released any comments.</p>"

        return "<div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;padding-right:7px'><p>After a night of waiting and pacing back and forth, the results had finally come in. State after state had been called. The whole campaign had all been leading up to this. I knew, deep down, that this could be my moment to make or break American history&hellip;<br /><br />And&hellip; It's a tie. It&rsquo;s a *goddamn* tie! 269-269.<br /><br />Deadlocked.&nbsp;<br /><br />I felt sweat drip down from my brow. I wanted to throw myself into a rage, to get angry, but all I felt was a deep emptiness. A stinging pain that I tried my best, and despite it all, I couldn&rsquo;t even lose right.<br /><br />But I couldn&rsquo;t let my supporters know that. No, no, no. I walked up on stage and made it clear how they should feel. I stomped my cowboy boots against the ground as I slammed my fist on the podium repeatedly. I railed on about how we will win in the end&hellip; no matter what. Once I finished the speech, nearly out of breath, I looked down at my supporters, the people who&rsquo;ve been with me through it all: their faces beaming with determination. They love me; they&rsquo;ll do anything for me.<br /><br />Of course, this means the election will go to the house which should have given me the advantage. However, it turns out around 30 representatives had begun the decomposition process six, maybe seven months ago and nobody had noticed. Unable to name any replacements, the Republicans got a narrow 3 seat edge over us, which became 2 after something similar happened on their side. It's not like we&rsquo;ve flipped enough seats in the House or Senate to make that much of a difference. Even if I somehow convinced Republicans to support me, it would wither away once Salad Dictatorship Woman gets her claws deeply embedded in them, which she does when the House votes to elect her President by a narrow margin.<br /><br />I keep up the rhetoric for as long as I can, even after the election gets certified, as I consult with military leaders who secretly support me. It&rsquo;s kept hush-hush as we warn them that anyone who leaks it will have to be put into the giant ice cube with Trump, and nobody wants that. We have a plan to win, a plan to make sure the REAL winner ends up in office.&nbsp;<br /><br />On January 5th, I walked through the White House with my Vice President, and I found my gaze moving to the portraits of past Presidents. I can&rsquo;t help but think about what they would&rsquo;ve done if they were in my shoes. Would Franklin Delano Roosevelt have launched a coup? I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m not a fucking politician. I&rsquo;m a Cheeseburger Freedom Man, goddammit!<br /><br />When I go to bed that day, ready for the chaos tomorrow will bring, I think back to my ex-wife. I think about how our relationship felt apart. The fire that used to burn had been extinguished long ago. A part of me hurts knowing we&rsquo;ll never reconcile after I throw the country into a crisis tomorrow.<br /><br />The day finally arrived, and it was a bloodbath indeed. What nobody expected was that both sides launched their own coup, trying to take down the other. CFM and SDW supporters fought each other in the streets, clawing at each other like cats. But that was a mere distraction from the real fight.<br /><br />Inside the White House, I grabbed my Big Fucking Gun that a supporter from Sweden by the name of Joel had sent me during my first term. I booked it to Congress where I knew the real battle was happening between the politicians. But someone else was there&hellip; Salad Dictatorship Woman.<br /><br />Against my better judgement, I tracked her down. Her red suit was in tatters. She must&rsquo;ve been attacked by one of my supporters. She looked at me with determination and fury in her eyes. Her rightful position was being taken from her, and she wouldn&rsquo;t let it go without a fight. And neither would I. I challenged her to a duel. We both promised whoever won would get the Presidency. It would be a duel that would decide the fate of the nation.&nbsp;<br /><br />As I charged towards her, ready to do what must be done to ensure FREEDOM, I couldn&rsquo;t help but think, &ldquo;Was it worth it?&rdquo;</p>"

Within the group I can just about make out my veep, Nancy Pelosi, Dick Cheney, Ass Cheney, Third-Thing Cheney, a slew of my own campaign staff and&hellip; another fella whose name I forgot. All of them donning party hats, they invite me over to the massive party going on in the other rooms. Apparently there's a guy that got so wasted he's started to hallucinate a stage play of sorts with a bunch of characters, a&hellip; thing that isn't.<br /><br />Eh, maybe they're right. Maybe I have been too hard on myself, who knows?<br /><br />They close the door, leaving me in a dimly lit room. As I get up from my post, making way towards the exit, something I deeply dreaded happens.<br /><br />The phone rings. Again.<br /><br />I groan loudly. I swear, do these low-lives have nothing better to do? It better be something important, like some guy wanting to build me a statue, or a feature biopic, or-<br /><br />Oh.<br /><br />I know this number.<br /><br />I&hellip; I should pick up.<br /><br />&hellip;<br /><br />That'd be awkward though, wouldn't it?<br /><br />I mean, we haven't had a sincere heart to heart for a while now, so why would&hellip;<br /><br />&hellip;<br /><br />I answer the phone.<br /><br />There's a few seconds of silence. Then, the words start flowing in. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't exactly tell you what the conversation was about. After the formal congratulations, we moved on to talking about the weather, I think. Just one of those boring things couples sometimes do&hellip; not that we are a couple anymore, anyway.<br /><br />She hangs up first. A mild feeling washes over me. I don't know what it is. If I had to describe it, it'd be something of a cross between&hellip; not wanting to let go and closure.<br /><br />I plant the phone firmly in its charging stand before getting up and joining my aides.<br /><br />I wouldn't mind a little celebration right about now.</p>"
