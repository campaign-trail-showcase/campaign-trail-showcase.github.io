If you’re curious to learn more about this election, I would recommend checking it out first. As of this mod’s publication, it’s available for free on the Internet Archive.</p><p>To learn about the candidates, I read Calhoun’s <b>Benjamin Harrison (2005)</b> for the American Presidents series and <b>Troy Senik’s A Man of Iron: The Turbulent Life and Improbable Presidency of Grover Cleveland (2022)</b>. Both were crucial to understand the deeply contrasting views on the role of government between Harrison and Cleveland.
