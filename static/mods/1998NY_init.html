Alfonse D'Amato, infamous for dirty campaigning in his past elections to the Senate, would be rivaled by Charles Schumer, who didn't shy away in shameless mudslinging. D'Amato would campaign primarily on being New York's dedicated public advocate, attempting to obfuscate his many conservative positions in doing so. However, Schumer, though a liberal Democrat, took many conservative stances in the race, transforming himself into a centrist that was comfortable pandering to the crime fearful audience cultivated by Rudolph Giuliani, William Jefferson and Hillary Rodham Clinton, Joseph Biden, among many others. In the years since, Schumer would walk back the platform he adopted in 1998, but hesitate to move further left than standard liberalism.</p><img src=\\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/1998_United_States_Senate_election_in_New_York_results_map_by_county.svg/450px-1998_United_States_Senate_election_in_New_York_results_map_by_county.svg.png\\\" width=\\\"220px\\\"><br><br>Senator D'Amato would go on to found Park Strategies, a consulting and lobbying firm in New York state. As of 2024, D'Amato remains the last Republican to represent New York in the Senate. Senator Schumer would go on to become Senate Minority Leader in 2017, before becoming Senate Majority Leader in 2021, of which he is the first New Yorker to serve in that position. Schumer would surpass Senators Jacob Javits and Daniel Patrick Moynihan as longest-serving Senator from New York in 2023.<p></p>\", \"has_visits\": 1, \"no_electoral_majority_image\": \"/static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg\"}}]");
