Pierre Poilievre, the Conservative leader, appears poised to become the next Prime Minister of Canada.</p><p>However, the winds are changing. Donald Trump's shock election win, combined with his trade policy, puts him on a collision course with the Canadian government. There are rumblings within the Liberal Party to push Trudeau out and seek out a new leader. Will Poilievre and the Conservatives cruise to victory?
