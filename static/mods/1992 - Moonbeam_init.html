                <p>
                    In early 1991, George H.W. Bush appeared invincible. 
                    Coming off of the high of Desert Storm with an 89% approval rating to show for it, his respectable challengers dropped out one by one, leaving the Democratic nomination for president a group of has-beens, never-weres, and never-will-bes. 
                    From this circus emerged one man: former California Governor Jerry Brown, Moonbeam himself, back to protect the Earth from the scourge of Bush.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But the times have changed since Brown’s last appearance on the national scene, and he has changed with them.
                    Though always something of a realist, any idealism he once possessed has been replaced by a searing rage against everything wrong with modern America, manifesting itself into an unrelenting drive to capture the presidency. Governor Moonbeam has already tried for the presidency twice before, and this is his last shot. He may win, he may lose, but he’ll be damned if he’s not going to give it everything he’s got.

                    Jerry Brown doesn’t need America. 
                    Jerry Brown doesn’t need anything. 
                    In another universe, Jerry could’ve easily spent his whole life in solitude learning the truths of the world through meditation, or perhaps helping the poor through their struggles on the mortal plane. 
                    He already avenged his father and took California back, already showed the people how to govern as a truly honest citizen, already embraced the limelight of political celebrity, and already proved that he could throw it all away for a higher calling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    America, however? America needs Jerry Brown. 
                    Since he last vied for the presidency, the dark forces that his father failed to contain have swept across the nation and laid waste to the great nation he once knew. 
                    The great capital of Washington D.C. has been transformed into a citadel of corruption, with Reagan’s pawn, Bush, serving as the false king of a uniparty Congress whose only goals are to enrich themselves and their decadent corporate overlords. 
                    With nobody else left to challenge this new oligarchy, the man they call Moonbeam knows that he is the nation’s last hope. 
                    As he begins his fight to take back America, Brown knows that the only way to win is not to campaign for the people–it’s to enlighten them.

                Just when America thought it had beaten its addiction to Massachusetts liberals of Greek descent, they got pulled back in when Paul Tsongas did far better than anyone had expected in the primaries. 
                Tsongas has an interesting mindset, matching you step for step in your social liberalism and populist worries about the state of the nation. 
                But if people called you fiscally conservative, Tsongas seems like a Republican with his fervent belief that Reaganomics has succeeded and that businesses, even dangerous, soulless, conglomerates, are the solution to America’s problems and not the problem itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Still, Tsongas just has a certain je sais ne quoi: for whatever the reason, people just really want to vote for the guy. 
                Yet behind his political strengths, substantial health concerns remain about his ability to survive the next four years. 
                Additionally, the regional appeal of a New Englander works directly against your interests, leaving Middle America wide open for the “Texan” Bush and Hoosier Quayle to carve up. 
                Ultimately, Tsongas is a gamble, one with the possibility to send you to the White House or to send you to the same electoral fate as the last Massachusetts Greek.

            There may be no more loyal soldier to the Democratic party than Dick Gephardt. 
            Gephardt has a few ideas that he genuinely believes in–specifically, his opposition to NAFTA–but beyond that, he will do absolutely anything if it means helping the party. 
            Unlike any number of party loyalists in safe districts, though, Gephardt is the House Majority Leader and a former presidential candidate, and easily has both the polish to share the national spotlight with you and the mettle to actually work with you should you win the election.
          </p>
          <p>
            The benefits don’t end there: as a Missourian and a representative from a working-class district of St. Louis, Gephardt will help counter the image of you as a coastal elite and put you on the inner track towards sweeping the industrial Midwest. 
            However, there’s a certain air to Gephardt that suggests he’s maybe a little too close to the party establishment. 
            Maybe it’s the flip-flops, maybe it’s his evolving relationship with money, and maybe it’s the hair and eyebrow combination, but something tells you that while Dick might be willing to be on the ticket should you play your cards right, you’ll never truly be on the same wavelength.

            Calling Bill Bradley a winner seemingly devalues the word: Bradley is a champion on the level of Hercules, an unstoppable combination of brain and brawn. 
            Bradley was the best high school basketball player in the country before becoming the best college player at Princeton, squeezing in an Olympic gold medal somewhere along the way. 
            Following a quick stint as a Rhodes scholar, where he won a European basketball title while playing on the weekends, he then went to the NBA and carved out a Hall of Fame career, winning two championships. 
            Then, the year after he retired, he was elected to the United States Senate from New Jersey.
            </p>
            <p>
            And yet, after an embarrassingly close reelection in 1990, Bradley’s career is at a crossroads. 
            He’s ambitious, but has doubts about the presidency. 
            He’s strong, but often comes off as cold. 
            He’s smart, but he’s operating at such a high level that he often seems aloof. 
            Still, he offers a desperately-needed balance to Governor Moonbeam. 
            By becoming your running mate, Bradley can offer a reasoned, rational balance to your idealism and make those ideas seem practical. 
            Once he gets in front of the national spotlight, he can finally show the people what a real winner looks like.

          David Pryor is a true public servant, having served in just about every possible elected position in his home state of Arkansas, spanning both chambers of the state and federal legislature and the governorship. 
          Boasting a witty, homespun style of retail politics combined with careful moderation, he’s an electoral juggernaut, winning his last Senate race with 99.83% of the vote. 
          He would not only bring you Arkansas, but would also help you be competitive in much of the South in November while still being mainstream enough to fit the rest of the country.
          </p>
          <p>
          With that being said, there’s one especially good reason to pick Pryor: it would be the perfect opportunity to spite Bill Clinton. 
          Pryor and Clinton are allies, but Pryor, like any normal career politician, desires power, enough to the point where it would take nothing more than the promise of the White House and a moderate amount of cajoling to get him on board with the program. 
          Wouldn’t it be the perfect rebuke of Slick Willie to see a white, middle-aged Arkansan former governor sharing the stage with Jerry Brown? 
          Pryor’s an appealing candidate in his own right, but the opportunity to screw Clinton with a man from his own backyard is incredibly tantalizing.

          There are few living men more admirable for black America than the Reverend Jesse Jackson, and none of them are as politically engaged. 
          Two separate times, he was counted out for the Democratic nomination, and two separate times, he did dramatically better than anyone expected, with his unashamed liberalism providing an antidote to those who claim the dream has died. 
          He’s a phenomenal speaker who’s more than happy to be your running mate, and he will do whatever it takes to support the ticket.
          </p>
          <p>
          The issue with Jesse isn’t that he’s a liberal, or that he’s hard on abortion, or that he’s soft on crime. 
          Few will say it out loud, but all of black America knows it: white America, in 1992, will never really support a self-assertive minority like himself. 
          They’ll say they might vote for him, will nicely talk about what a good leader he is for the black community, and will dodge the question until November comes and they pull the lever for Bush. 
          Underneath Jerry Brown, Jesse will be shielded from the worst of it, and even the most pessimistic wouldn’t automatically assign them defeat, but it’s going to be an uphill battle.
