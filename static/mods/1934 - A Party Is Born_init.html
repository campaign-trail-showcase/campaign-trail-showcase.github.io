            "summary": "For all your life, the state of Wisconsin has been defined by its one true party: the Republicans. Where most states see regular bipartisan struggle, Wisconsin's political core has been entirely concentrated in the GOP. Whether you were an arch-conservative Stalwart or a radical progressive, you stood in the Republican primary or faced an inevitable defeat.<br><br>With the New Deal, you have seen this system crumble. As the state's Democrats were revived by the promise of FDR, the rural poor and industrial laborers that voted for progressive Republicans turned to them, leaving Stalwarts in control of the party. These men have cemented the GOP as a conservative institution, built to deny the working man's due.<br><br>What remains of progressivism in Wisconsin depends on those few men with the strength to protect it. Your father has passed. Your brother lacks the spirit. It's up to you, Phil. Find a way out.",

The threads of his life - his conversion to Progressivism, his runs for Senator and the Presidency - litter your speeches and the speeches of your peers. Almost a decade ago, you and your brother returned to Washington to see him before he passed on. Your family still holds a memorial on that day, every year.<br><br>\n\nYou and Bob have attempted to maintain his course since then, but it has not been easy. Each of you quickly found statewide seats, but without Dad's charisma and connections, you have been left to face a GOP which has drifted into fierce conservatism, polarized against the New Deal. While Bob has managed to hold on to his Senator seat, your more audacious rhetoric left you vulnerable in the Republican primary for governor. You were the first La Follette to lose an election - in a primary, no less.<br><br>Now, you quietly maintain the La Follette machine and hope for better times. Yet as the Republican Party refuses to accept the New Deal, some part of you is coming to accept that standing by their party may no longer be an option.\n",

He's the namesake, and without Mom and Dad, he heads the family. Everyone knows he's destined for greatness, maybe even the presidency. Can they say the same about you?<br><br>\n\nBob is not much like his father. He inherited the name, the ideals, but not the spirit - he doesn't preach to the crowds like Dad, but talks plainly on needs and solutions. You're the one who got Dad's lust for adventure. If Wisconsin politics must be rebuilt, you are the man to do it. Just make sure that you've got Bob's blessing before you kick the doors down.\n",
