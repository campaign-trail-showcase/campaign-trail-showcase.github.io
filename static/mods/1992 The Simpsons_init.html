George Bush's success as President is as hollow as his promises. Rising unemployment, rising healthcare costs and American workers being undermined with NAFTA.</p><p>There seems to be a hole in the political conscience, as if America is longing for a change of the two party monopoly.

Yet, his biggest issues is actually forming a campaign, as of now he'd be lucky to get half of Lyndon LaRouche's PV.
