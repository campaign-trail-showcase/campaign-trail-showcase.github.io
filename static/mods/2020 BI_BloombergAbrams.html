<h2>'The Dawn of The Progressive Party and the Death of The Democrats'</h2>

<p>How could this happen? Was it Bernie? Of course, it was Bernie. That guy threw a tantrum that tossed the election over to Trump. Was it the politically motivated scandals? All we know is that you’ve lost and you performed worse than most candidates in the modern era.</p>

<p>You turned to gaze out the window and witness the chaos in the streets. People want you dead, and you’re a little frightened at what’s happening outside. So, you packed your bags and fled to the Cayman Islands to, uh, return to your business life without the threat of murder or harassment.</p>

<p>Years pass, and the Democratic Party is gone, or at least, politically irrelevant. In their place emerged Bernie Sanders’ “Progressive Party,” which, to you, felt humiliating—an indication of how badly you fucked up to warrant the formation of a new party.</p>
