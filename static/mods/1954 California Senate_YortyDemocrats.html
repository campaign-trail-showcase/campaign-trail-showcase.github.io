        When you saw that the returns had you winning, you could not believe it. 
        You came into this election as a liberal Democrat who stood for workers and your average Californian, and it worked. 
        The people loved you for your vision of America—an America built from the liberalism of Roosevelt. 
        Your victory has also revitalized your party here after the debacle that was 1950. 
        Kuchel has already called to concede to you, shocked that he faltered this badly.<br><br> 
        Now, this was only a special election. You will have to win again in 1956 for a full term, 
        but that should not be too much of a challenge. If you took down a strong opponent here, 
        there is no reason why you can't win in '56. Regardless, your tenure in the Senate could be a lot of things, 
        but the people elected you based on your liberalism, so don't turn your back on it. 
        It finally feels like you stand for something.`;

        Defeating a strong opponent like Kuchel was never going to be easy, even with the boost from the McCarthy backlash. 
        You came into this election as a liberal Democrat who stood for workers and the average Californian—and it failed. 
        The people simply weren't persuaded by your intentions and chose to stick with Kuchel. 
        Perhaps you didn't give any reasons for why people should like you, and perhaps you were just too negative.<br><br>
        Now, where to go from here is tricky. Another run for the Senate will likely produce the same results, 
        and returning to the House is unlikely too. Perhaps you can run for LA Mayor, but with a new twist. 
        Liberalism wasn't what people looked for in you before, so perhaps a new leaf is needed. 
        A new and reformed Yorty? We'll see.`;
