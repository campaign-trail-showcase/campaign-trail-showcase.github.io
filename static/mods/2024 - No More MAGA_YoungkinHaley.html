Nobody expected this, Governor, and for good reason. <br> <br> Ever since Hawley walked out of the convention and started that damned third-party, ever since Buttigieg began to stump like hell through red territory, you thought you were done for. But somehow, some way, you've managed to win a landslide. Buttigieg delivers a stunned concession call.<br> <br> Congress, however, is likely to remain Democratic. Republicans did flip West Virginia and Montana, along with Ohio, but Democrats have kept 52 Senate seats, and, while they have significant gains in the House, Speaker Jeffries will retain the gavel. You'll have to govern in a bipartisan fashion, Governor, but it's a necessary sacrifice. You are President of the United States. Good luck. Godspeed.</p>",
