The twilight of the Clinton 90s brought a degree of stability and prosperity, culminating in a popular presidency under the Democratic Party, despite it's scandals. The break of the new millennium brought many feelings, some of optimism, some of uncertainty, but potential for change nonetheless. The decade of Third Way Liberalism culminating in leftist unrest, and the rebirth of the Republican Party as a new fighting force under Newt Gingrich has brought from both edges of the 2 party system fresh faces.<br><br>This brings forth 2 new candidates. The question of these 2 candidates is not merely random, but by their great potential to change America. A schoolteacher and a buisnessman, a liberal and a progressive, an enterprising man who seeks to create an America where merit and ambition stands above all, and a humble man who seeks to create an America where everybody is held up. They must struggle in the cause of shaping America into the new decade, and shaping their parties into what they dream it may one day be. If America is to head down the wrong direction, in the minds of both, then it will be a calamity. Both will have to dedicate themselves to their cause, or live with the ghost of failure.",

Kasich has made a name for himself as a fiscal conservative and a supporter of supply side economics who has worked with Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp in the house to pass conservative legislation. He is somewhat hawkish on foreign policy, having voted in favor of the Gulf War and playing an important role in the Goldwater–Nichols Act, although he has shown restraint when it comes to defense spending if he is to deem it fiscally irresponsible. Kasich is a powerful candidate in the suburbs with his flavor of mainline consensus conservatism and institutional appeal. <br><br>Kasich would be a boon in his home state of Ohio and a strong pick to add a more mainline and credentialed candidate to your somewhat outsider campaign.</p>",
