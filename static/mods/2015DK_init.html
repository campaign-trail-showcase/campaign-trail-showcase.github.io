            <h1>Thank you for playing 2015 Denmark!</h1>
            <p>Due to the obscure nature of Danish politics in the foreign sphere, many of the sources used for this mod have been in Danish. The main reference for different statistics and voter patterns is in the book “Oprør fra Udkanten: Folketingsvalget 2015” which is described in the following article:</p>
            <p><a href=\\\"https://www.carlsbergfondet.dk/en/Forskningsaktiviteter/Research-Projects/Other-Research-Projects/Kasper-Moeller-Hansen_The-Danish-Parliamentary-Election-2015/\\\">The Danish Parliamentary Election 2015 - Rebellion from the Periphery</a></p><p><b>The 2015 Election:</b></p>
            <p>The 2015 election was chosen for the mod due to a great number of factors, most strikingly being showcasing Dansk Folkeparti at the apex of the party’s power. DF was seen as an example for many other European right-wing populists during its peak, and understanding the party’s path to power is crucial to understanding the anti-immigrant rhetoric that has been this pervasive in the nation’s politics. Its growth also lies in a dissatisfactory political status quo, which led to more than 20 percent of the Danish population setting their crosses next to the party. The failures of the party not long after due to splinters and factionalization of the populist right is also central to understanding Danish politics. Other factors include the rapid rise of climate politics in the Danish electoral sphere with Alternativet’s breakout success at the election, the Syrian Refugee Crisis which loomed just around the corner after it and the hostile political environment leading up to the election that caused all the societal divide.</p>
            <p>Danish elections as a whole seem to be misunderstood by outsiders looking in due to the country’s nature as a welfare state, so showing the internal divisions that form the country has been a major goal of this mod as well.</p>
            <p>Anyways, thank you a lot for playing the mod. Thanks to the NCT community for giving me the different tools that I needed to make this a reality, everyone in the credits have been monumental in making this the best mod it can be. It was certainly blast to make. I hope you enjoyed this little window into the politics of a small, messy and, divided country.</p>
          </div>`;
