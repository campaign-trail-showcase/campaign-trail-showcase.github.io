Eastland has made remarks stating that he would be open for a possible presidential run following the ascension of two open liberals running in both parties.<br><br>Eastland's strengths are that he is from the deep south, a place that you are <b>not</b> from. Meaning that he would be very good in helping cement your support there. He is a run-of-the-mill segregationist senator and would as such, appeal to those groups.<br><br>His main drawbacks is that he would do nothing to appeal to anybody outside the deep south. He is also pretty anti-semitic and would hurt with the jewish vote. But it wasn't like you had a chance with them.<br><br>If you want to stick to your guns and prevent the election of one of two liberals, then pick Eastland.","candidate_score":1,"running_mate":true,"scrollable":false,"partner":"2"}}];e.running_mate_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.running_mate","pk":2001,"fields":{"candidate":24,"running_mate":1004}},{"model":"campaign_trail.running_mate","pk":2002,"fields":{"candidate":24,"running_mate":1005}},{"model":"campaign_trail.running_mate","pk":2003,"fields":{"candidate":24,"running_mate":1006}},{"model":"campaign_trail.running_mate","pk":2004,"fields":{"candidate":23,"running_mate":1007}},{"model":"campaign_trail.running_mate","pk":2005,"fields":{"candidate":23,"running_mate":1008}},{"model":"campaign_trail.running_mate","pk":2006,"fields":{"candidate":23,"running_mate":1009}},{"model":"campaign_tral.running_mate","pk":2007,"fields":{"candidate":25,"running_mate":1010}}];
