Others believe her to be a “chancellor of standstill”, responsible for the economic and cultural malaise in which the largest economy of Europe finds itself at the onset of the 2020’s. After leading four cabinets, she is now preparing to step down - a historic milestone in the history of the Republic, as the <b>Federal Election of 2021</b> is poised to be the first in which no incumbent chancellor will be defending their position. Not only that: it seems as though three parties might be able to lead the next government, with different characters vying to reform the country in their own image, to lead Germany into a <i>Decade</i> of their own vision.</p><p>All of this happens as the <b>SARS-CoV-2</b> virus ravages the country, changing the lives of people around the world like few crises of this century. Not only that: the cultural cleavage, the persistent development of a split in western societies, permeates Germany just as much. The number one issue for many cosmopolitanists is <b>climate change</b> and the transition to renewable energies, catapulting the Greens to the front of the political scene. On the other side, many blue collar workers and rural traditionalists feel <b>alienated</b>, particularly in East Germany - culminating in the electoral success of the AfD.<br>Anyone seeking to succeed Merkel will have to navigate this unique political moment between <b>Unity, <span style='color: red;'>Justice</span> and <span style='color: #8B8000;'>Freedom</span></b>.</p>\", \"image_url\": \"https://jetsimon.com/cts-media/public/2021DE_init_0.png\", \"winning_electoral_vote_number\": 368, \"advisor_url\": \"https://i.ibb.co/PQrG6fR/advisors.jpg\", \"recommended_reading\": \"\", \"has_visits\": 0, \"no_electoral_majority_image\": \"/static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg\", \"site_description\":\"After 16 years of Angela Merkel's stable but stagnant stewardship of Germany, the country stands at a crossroads.<br>As Covid-19 dominates everyday life, as populism takes hold in alienated parts of society and awareness about climate change grows in others, three candidates are battling it out to determine the future of the Federal Republic.<br>Which party will lead the country to frame the next decade?

They were founded in the aftermath of the Second World War, merging the remnants of the bourgeois camp and the Zentrumspartei of the Weimar Republic, uniting protestants and catholics. They’ve made it their task to represent “The Center” of German society, espousing a center-right conservatism based in Christian Humanism. Since 1949, they have dominated German politics - more often than not, the chancellor has been a member of the CDU.</p><p>For more than sixteen years now, Angela Merkel has been the face of the CDU, capturing solid electoral majorities, governing once with the Liberals, thrice with the Social Democrats. As the populace now slowly loses trust in the compromises of the so-called “Grand Coalition”, she has announced her retirement. However, her handpicked successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, resigned as party leader less than a year before the election, making it unclear who will follow in her footsteps.</p><p>The Union has several competing wings - a moderate wing that wants to broadly continue Merkel’s policies, and a conservative wing that wants a return to rightist orthodoxy. Meanwhile, the Bavarian offshoot CSU - considered economically leftwards and culturally rightwards of its bigger sister - also harbors significant influence on the national stage.

Since its establishment in 1875, the SPD has played a significant role in the country's political landscape - from the worker’s movement, the establishment of the Weimar Republic, the resistance against Hitler and the establishment of this iteration of the German state. Since the Second World War, it has provided three of the eight chancellors of Germany.</p><p>Since the defeat of chancellor Schröder against Merkel in 2005 though, the days of the party seem finally numbered. For the last eight years, it had the thankless job of being the junior coalition partner of the CDU/CSU - eroding their identity, suffering disastrous defeat after disastrous defeat, all in the name of good governance instead of ideology. Indeed, the SPD has become somewhat of a laughing stock, especially since the Greens have overtaken them in polls - a historical first. A lot of Social Democrats seek a return to a more leftist vision, as the rift between party base and party elites grows deeper and wider.</p><p>With how much the party is struggling and ailing - achieving not even 16% in the European Elections of 2019 - those who believe the tides can turn grow fewer and fewer.

Combining idiosyncratic elements of the New Left, pacifist- and anti-nuclear-movements, social egalitarians as well as conservationists, the colorful mixture of a party was quarreling at every corner. Nonetheless, the Greens managed to enter parliament in 1983, solidifying themselves as the defining postmaterialist force in German politics. After reunification, they merged with Alliance 90, an East German civil rights party. Since then, they have broadened their appeal from purely pacifism and environmentalism to be a general center-left party, though their strongest focus remains on combating climate change.</p><p>Having taken responsibility during the Red-Green coalition from 1998-2005, the Greens have moderated quite a bit. Recently, they're on a surprising upwards trajectory, being involved in the majority of state governments, even leading one in Baden-Württemberg. With climate change increasing in salience since 2018, they have overtaken the SPD in polls - now, they find themselves the first ‘minor party’ to have a sensible shot at the chancellery. </p><p>However, the Green Party is known for having strong showings in the polls and being unable to actually convert that to votes come election day. For now, they look like the main contender against the CDU/CSU, but a lot can still change.

Governing the former SPD stronghold in a moderate-conservative Black-Yellow coalition of CDU and FDP, he was speculated to jump into the 2018 leadership race about Merkel's succession. He declined, but after party leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer threw in the towel after three years, he is eager to join the new contest, taking over her lane as the „continuity-candidate“ – all the way up to the chancellor candidacy. <br>Whilst having the reputation of an integrous statesman, he is also quite gaffe-prone. If he can maneuver this weakness, he might be the best candidate to continue Merkel's style of governance.</p><p><i><b>”I may not be the man of perfect staging, but I am Armin Laschet, and you can count on that.”</b></i></p><p><b>Armin Laschet</b> had no ambition to be chancellor – until now.</p><p>Born into a devout catholic middle class family to a miner and his housewife in Aachen, “the heart of Europe“, the CDU politician started his career in the 1994 Bundestag election. After losing his mandate 4 years later, he started an accomplished foray into the European Parliament, after which he returned to his home state of North Rhine-Westphalia.</p><p>In 2017, he defeated popular SPD incumbent Hannelore Kraft, in what many consider the beginning of the end of the SPD federal election campaign that year. Since then, he has governed NRW, Germany's most populous state, in a CDU-FDP “Black-Yellow” coalition. His tenure turned out to fall straight into Angela Merkel's last term. </p><p>When the chancellor orchestrated Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer to be her successor in 2018, many expected Laschet to throw his hat into the ring, as a compromise candidate between Kramp-Karrenbauer and the comeback of conservative insurgent Friedrich Merz. He declined, and Kramp-Karrenbauer’s leadership of the next 3 years proved wildly unpopular. In 2021, she finally decided to throw the towel. Even though his Covid-leadership has been shaky, the NRW-Minister President kept a good amount of respect among his peers – and in this new leadership contest, Laschet sees his time to have come.</p><p>Derided by some as a „backup“, he's widely expected to fill in the lane on which Kramp-Karrenbauer won in 2018 – as the „continuity-candidate“. His opponents, the returning Friedrich Merz and the disgraced Norbert Röttgen, are both symbols of the past – it is up to Armin Laschet to show that he can lead the party, and eventually the country, into the 2020’s.</p><p>It's up to you to deal with his controversies, his perceived aloofness and the unexpected political climate, especially since other figures of power seem to perceive a power vacuum…</p>\", \"candidate_score\": 0.0}}, {\"model\": \"campaign_trail.candidate\", \"pk\": 308, \"fields\": {\"first_name\": \"Friedrich\", \"last_name\": \"Merz\", \"election\": 9, \"party\": \"CDU\", \"state\": \"North Rhine-Westphalia\", \"priority\": 9, \"description\": \"'\", \"color_hex\": \"#0000FF\", \"secondary_color_hex\": \"#90C0FF\", \"is_active\": 0, \"image_url\": \"https://i.ibb.co/P4hnWXb/Merz.jpg\", \"electoral_victory_message\": \"'\", \"electoral_loss_message\": \"'\", \"no_electoral_majority_message\": \"'\", \"description_as_running_mate\": \"<p><i>“I left politics 10 years ago.

His popularity could make him the 3rd ever Bavarian chancellor candidate.

As a teen, he admired Franz-Josef Strauß, hanging up a big poster of the legendary Bavarian politician on his ceiling. He’s a cinephile, particularly with Science Fiction. And he’s known for his eccentric carnival costumes, be it Gandalf, Homer Simpson, Paul Stanley or in full-on drag. </p><p>Due to his conservative upbringing, he joined the JU and began his career in politics - always in his home state of Bavaria. And of course - always upwards. Ambition. Drive. First, chair of the JU Bavaria. Then, General Secretary of the CSU. Then, State Minister in 3 different departments. Always more.</p><p>Söder might be a man of power - but one who knows what the people want. His ideological idiosyncrasy can be identified as populism, both in ire and praise. Be it a hard line against immigration and refugees, advocating for crucifixes and singing the anthem in schools, or his advocacy for traditional values, or: praising gay marriage, introducing a bavarian Space Program (Bavaria One), and standing against nuclear energy. In the words of his biographer: “He has a baroque and sometimes bizarre enjoyment of self-presentation, always following the political climate.”</p><p>His cunning can’t be doubted, and he knows how to use it. In 2017, he pressured Minister-President Horst Seehofer, his mentor, from the office, taking it for himself. As the new Bavarian head of government, he ran a hard line on Covid. More importantly though, he pushed the line on climate action within his conservative party - already in 2007 he demanded a ban on admitting new cars with combustion engines come 2020. He wants to save the bees, he advocates for an early exit from coal and for a climate-neutral Bavaria until 2040. Enshrining environmental protection within the constitution, even.</p><p>For his opponents, it’s clear what he’s doing - cold opportunism. But is it really wrong, if it produces results? Markus Söder is one of the most popular politicians in the country, respected among evangelical church goers and environmentalist soccer moms alike. In fact, many people - including within the Union - see him as a good choice for an even higher office.</p><p>Only two CSU politicians were ever chancellor candidates, Söders icon Strauß, and another mentor of his, Edmund Stoiber. Both lost: but Söder knows not to repeat their mistakes. He knows the country yearns for change.

Having an illustrious career since the Red-Green coalition, serving in several roles over two decades, most prominently Mayor of Hamburg, he is known for a calm, technocratic demeanor, dubbed the “Scholzomat” - drawing comparisons to Merkel herself.

You could sit in a corner and say; surely everything is going to end badly. But honestly, with that attitude, you can't govern a country.”</i></b></p><p><b>Olaf Scholz</b> is as boring as his three-syllabled name. He’s a self-avowed technocrat, embracing the nickname “Scholzomat”. He has “die Ruhe weg” (meaning he’s always calm), he has a small statue, a nondescript face, a bald head, a small black briefcase, he thinks politics is “fun” and in his free time, he enjoys reading scientific literature.</br>Nonetheless, or perhaps because of that, he is the most likely choice to become chancellor candidate of the Social Democratic Party of Germany.</p><p>It wasn’t always like that. Born to a family of textile workers, growing up in Osnabrück and Hamburg, when he was twelve, his career aspiration was “chancellor”. He entered the Jusos, the youth wing of the SPD, and became a leading voice in its far-left “Stamokap”-wing. He quit the church, he held speeches against Nato, against capitalism and against the social-liberal coalition of SPD and FDP. He even undertook several trips to East Germany, maintaining relationships with the communist cadres of the dictatorship.</p><p> Be it due to opportunism, a change in attitude after reunification, or simply due to growing up; he quickly abandoned those tendencies when working as a practitioner of labor law. He rose through the ranks of the SPD Hamburg, becoming MP in Gerhard Schröder’s landslide in 1998, vehemently defending the third-way-neoliberal agenda of the Red-Green coalition, even becoming Schröders General-Secretary. In 2004, he quit, one year before his boss lost the election. It wasn’t long until newly elected chancellor Angela Merkel saw his potential, giving him her Ministry of Labor for two years.</p><p> Afterwards, his impressive resumé made him Mayor of Hamburg, giving him the keys to the Senate of Germany’s second biggest city from 2011-2018. His tenure was known for a big increase in housing construction - but also several scandals, including a botched response to the G20-summit of 2017 and a shady role during the cum-ex scandals of the prominent Warburg-bank.</p><p> His leadership role in the party only increased when he became Minister of Finances and Vice Chancellor in Merkel's unpopular third Grand Coalition. Since Schröders defeat in 2005, the trajectory of his party led downwards, coinciding with a general trend of an identity crisis within European Social Democracy. The SPD reached a low of 20% in the elections of 2017, and after entering another unpopular coalition anyways, now bled to third place, behind The Greens. Internal disagreements ultimately made party chair Andrea Nahles quit her place, leaving a power vacuum in the ailing “oldest party of Germany”.</p><p>Olaf Scholz is now perceived as a leader of its moderate wing: with his unwavering loyalty and rationality, he needs to give a new shine to the SPD.

Habeck got the message, and they worked well together, being reelected as party chairs with a record 97.1% one year later.</p><p>It wasn’t just coincidence that the ‘dynamic duo’ got such a good result - over the course of 2018, frustration with the Status Quo and the explosion of pent-up environmentalist outrage of an oft-forgotten German youth erupted in a polling surge for The Greens. Winning a meager 8.9% in 2017, suddenly, two years later, the party found itself rivaling even the CDU for first place. Something seemed feasible, that most would’ve thought absurd just months before; <i>The Greens have a shot at the chancellery</i>. <br>Since Covid hit, the narrative moved on, with Merkel profiting from a rally-around-the-flag surge. But nonetheless, The Greens remain in second place, finding a footing in the German middle class that positions them to be the top challenger for whoever the CDU puts up. And after Kramp-Karrenbauer faltered, it’s probably gonna be another man.</p><p>This is Baerbocks shot. As a young woman, people will be fierce on her lack of experience, on her lack of “Gravitas”. She might not be able to afford many mistakes. But she thinks she can do it: as long as Robert understands that this race needs a woman - she might very well become the youngest, the second female, and the first Green chancellor of Germany.</p>\", \"candidate_score\": 0.0}}, {\"model\": \"campaign_trail.candidate\", \"pk\": 312, \"fields\": {\"first_name\": \"Robert\", \"last_name\": \"Habeck\", \"election\": 9, \"party\": \"Greens\", \"state\": \"Schleswig-Holstein\", \"priority\": 13, \"description\": \"'\", \"color_hex\": \"#00C100\", \"secondary_color_hex\": \"#A1FFA1\", \"is_active\": 0, \"image_url\": \"https://i.ibb.co/VBZWCSM/habeck.jpg\", \"electoral_victory_message\": \"'\", \"electoral_loss_message\": \"'\", \"no_electoral_majority_message\": \"'\", \"description_as_running_mate\": \"<p><i>”We sometimes have this tendency to make arguments immune within an academically coloured language. We’ll have to work on that.”</i> Robert Habeck is the former Minister of Agriculture from Schleswig-Holstein, and the male co-chair of The Greens. The learned philosopher and philologist has earned valuable experience serving in that capacity, commanding respect beyond party lines. He calls himself a „pragmatic idealist“ - and after The Greens shot up in polling over the last 3 years, his ambition is to lead the first Green-led government. If his worldview can prove to be more salient than the gender question, he might win out over his colleague, Annalena Baerbock, to become the first Green chancellor candidate – and if he manages to keep being the patient listener he has a reputation to be, Habeck might have a good shot at the top government post.</p><p><b><i>”We sometimes have this tendency to make arguments immune within an academically coloured language. We’ll have to work on that.”</i></b><p>If there was ever someone who could be described as a “photogenically brash intellectual with a rustic northern attitude”, they’re probably quite similar to <b>Robert Habeck</b>.</p><p>Habeck was born to a pair of pharmacists in Lübeck, home of the Hanseatic League in Northern Germany. Perhaps somewhat stereotypical for a Green, he studied Germanistics, Philosophy and Philology. During a foreign exchange year to Denmark, he was deeply impressed by the Nordic systems. It was there where he developed a (perhaps somewhat oxymoronic) “pragmatic idealism”, personally and politically. He also got to know his wife there, with whom he successfully published literature since the 90’s, mostly children’s books, adult fiction and translations of english lyricism. Living in his home state of Schleswig-Holstein with his family, he shares deep cultural ties to Northern Germany and the Danish minority population.</p><p>It was there where his political career took off rather abruptly. Joining the Green party in 2002, he immediately got introduced into local leadership circles, becoming Schleswig-Holstein’s Green party chair only two years later. Over the next 10 years, he gathered valuable experience in local politics, culminating in him becoming the state’s Vice Minister President in 2012, and with it, taking the mantle of “Minister of Agriculture, Energy Transition, the Environment and Rural Spaces”. His tenure was considered quite successful - his “no-bullshit”-attitude proved popular with broody farmers and fishermen, which helped to make Schleswig-Holstein’s agricultural sector more ecologically sustainable.</p><p>In his stride, he tried to bring his visions to a national level, running for The Green’s top candidacy in 2017, losing by an unexpectedly narrow margin. In 2018, his charisma and outsized credentials made him co-party chair, alongside Annalena Baerbock. Habeck’s pragmatism met the mood of the party - it was the first time The Greens had two members of its moderate Realo-wing at its helm, caught by an eagerness to govern.</p><p>And this ambition became increasingly probable. During this time, frustrations with the political Status Quo and the meager progress on climate action made Germany’s youth protest in the streets, with a generation of parents just as disappointed with the third Grand Coalition within 20 years. The dynamic duo of Habeck and Baerbock met the moment of this longing for change, and the Greens shot up in polling, overtaking the ailing SPD, rivaling the governing CDU/CSU for first place.</p><p>Since then, the polling highs subsided, due to Covid taking over the political discourse - but Habeck knows, this is his time. He wants to serve. Although Annalena Baerbock has her own ambitions, with The Greens eager for a new chapter in Germany’s governance, “pragmatic idealism” and governing experience might just win out over the Gender question, handing Robert Habeck the keys to the nomination and - if he doesn’t lose patience with himself and the German electorate - all the way to the chancellery.</p>\", \"candidate_score\": 0.0}}]");

Every voter has two votes, one for a party and one for a directly elected candidate in their constituency. Theoretically, half the parliament is determined first past the post by these direct elections and half proportionally through the party votes, with seats allocated with the Sainte-Laguë method on a per-state basis.<br> However, if a party receives more seats through this system than it would if the parliament was elected by strictly proportional votes, they get extra (overhanging) mandates and all over parties get compensatory mandates. Overall, all but three overhanging mandates get compensated. <br> To enter parliament, a party either needs 5% of the proportional vote or win in at least three districts. <br> For the purpose of this game, the system has been simplified. Only the proportional vote has been simulated - though there are some heuristics to guess the number of constituencies won by parties where this is relevant.`;

    <p>This mod offers five unique difficulty settings to customize your game.<br>

    <strong>Campaign Difficulty</strong> is the standard difficulty setting that impacts your party's standing in the polls.<br>

    <strong>Coalition Difficulty</strong> determines the difficulty of post-election coalition negotiations. On "Guaranteed", any coalition you select will form, independent of election results. Generally, coalition probabilities are based on the election winner, margin of victory, campaign decisions, and certain coalitions' inherent likelihood.<br>

    The <strong>Alternate Election Night option </strong>allows you to switch to an election night experience that is more in line with how election night plays out in Germany<br>

    The <strong>Advisor mode</strong> allows you to hire and dismiss your campaign advisors during the campaign. They all have different effects and can be found in the headquarter.<br>

    The <strong><span class="mytooltip">Tooltip option<span class="mytooltiptext">Look out for words with a light blue background like this and hover them for a tooltip.</span></span> </strong>provides tooltips for key phrases, offering extra explanations - especially beneficial for those not acquainted with German politics.</p>
